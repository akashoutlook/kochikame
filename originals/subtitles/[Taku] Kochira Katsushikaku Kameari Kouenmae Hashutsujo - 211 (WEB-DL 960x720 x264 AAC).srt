When you watch TV,

13
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,780
make your room bright and

14
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,040
please watch it from a distance!

18
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
Those who don't have money,

19
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,780
come to me!

20
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,040
I don't have any,

21
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,920
but I'm worried.

22
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm worried.

23
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,960
Look!

24
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,040
The blue sky,

25
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,120
the white clouds,

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
they'll be all right

27
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

28
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,540
Those who don't have work,

29
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,040
come to me!

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,900
Come here!

31
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,960
I don't have any,

32
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,480
but I'm worried.

33
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,580
Look!

34
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,440
The red clouds are burning

35
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

36
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,520
They'll be all right.

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,620
They'll be all right.

38
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,980
They'll be all right.

39
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,540
I know, right?

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
I know, I know!

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,740
If you know, just stay quiet and come with me!

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,520
Just stay quiet and come with me!

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
UwU

44
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,940
You don't have to worry!

45
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,940
I know, I know!

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,540
That's all for today.

47
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,520
I hope you enjoyed it.

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,980
The young boys' crime is in the low age category.

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,840
As a child, it's not a person's business.

50
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,480
You're in the way.

51
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,240
Can you move out of the bed?

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,220
Ah, yes, yes.

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Even so, we moved in a long time ago.

54
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,840
Why are you in a corner?

55
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,720
No, it's too big.

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,700
I can't calm down without a wall behind me.

57
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,960
It's a poor thing.

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,380
By the way, what are the children doing?

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,040
I was playing games until a while ago, but I think I'm already asleep.

60
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,400
I see.

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,380
You're sleeping well.

62
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,820
Well, it's okay for my child.

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,180
I was playing games at home.

64
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,820
It's summer vacation, so I want you to take me somewhere to play.

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,760
Shinji went to Hawaii with his father and everyone.

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,620
I want to go somewhere, too.

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,580
Yoshiko went to a mountain in the countryside.

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,040
He wanted to go fishing.

69
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,100
I want to catch a cicada or a beetle.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,260
What happened to your face?

71
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,500
Haruo went to the sea and went fishing and made fireworks.

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,880
Because I love the sea, I want to go fishing there.

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,580
I want to go fishing.

74
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,240
I want to go fishing.

75
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,340
Haruo, who became a monk in the sea.

76
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,560
Haruo, who became a monk in the sea.

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
What's going on?

78
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,260
He's making a wasp face.

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,980
Yes.

80
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,860
Mr. Mokuzu is enjoying cruising with his family on weekends.

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,460
Well, it's best to meet nature that you don't get to see in the city.

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,080
The beauty of the stars seen in the sea is so moving.

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,540
I don't think the kids will worry about flying.

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm glad I bought a cruiser.

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,640
It's fun to stay on a ship.

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
Dad is amazing! I caught such a big fish the other day!

87
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,720
This is it!

88
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,880
Dad is a young captain!

89
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,160
What? You bought a ship?

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,060
You don't have to be so surprised.

91
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,520
What's wrong, Terai? Are you finally desperate for life?

92
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,860
No, don't make a fuss.

93
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,780
I'm not making a fuss.

94
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,620
What's wrong?

95
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,180
You have a life that suits you.

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,560
That's right, Terai.

97
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,080
That's the point. I was wondering what my life was like until now.

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,860
I was busy at work and didn't have time to spend time with the kids.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
I didn't have anything that I could call my hobby.

100
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,940
I think I'll buy a ship and spend time with nature for the sake of the children's education.

101
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,680
I think I'll get the job, too.

102
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Are you suddenly talking about cruisers?

103
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,300
You, who have never been in a life of life.

104
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,420
I'm going to give you a home steal because you're only two outs behind the nine-point lead.

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,580
You, shut up!

106
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,580
Terai is thinking of you.

107
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,800
Maybe, Terai.

108
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,560
Haa...

109
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,040
By the way, I had a lot of fun when I first rode my father's cruiser.

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,780
I have a lot of fun.

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,640
That's right.

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,940
Well, your dad's back looks bigger and stronger than usual.

113
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,020
That's right. I want to ride a cruiser like a father and a man like Yuzo Kayama.

114
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,820
What's a young captain? You're the most unsuitable cruiser in Japan.

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,880
It's not like that. Yuzo Kayama is impossible, but if it's a young captain like Kunie Tanaka...

116
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,380
We can't keep up with you because you talk too much.

117
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,140
Really?

118
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,500
Do you know how much a cruiser costs? It's as expensive as a ball of cotton flying out.

119
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,260
That's because there's something you can dig out. It's this.

120
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,760
It's perfect for a father who's a working man. It's a cruiser for a family.

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,020
Wow, Ryo-san, it's a cruiser! A cruiser!

122
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,300
Yeah, I know. But is this something you can get with a working man's salary?

123
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,540
Welcome!

124
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,360
All of our cruisers are the best.

125
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,820
Hey, you!

126
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,940
What?

127
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,080
You're a fake real estate agent and a fake travel agent!

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,740
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,240
Are you looking for a cruiser?

130
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,640
Yeah, but it looks expensive.

131
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't worry about it. This cruiser is delivered with confidence by us.

132
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,600
It costs 80 million yen, and it's 40 million yen.

133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,680
80 million yen is 40 million yen?

134
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,120
80 million yen is 40 million yen?

135
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,600
It's half the price!

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,720
Are you going to buy it?

137
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,240
I-I can't...

138
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,460
We've got something even more expensive for you.

139
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Here it is.

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,220
It's 80 million yen, and it's 100 million yen.

141
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
100 million yen? That's a lot of money, Ryo-san.

142
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,040
And now we've got a hanging health machine and some tea mushrooms.

143
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,480
It's getting more and more expensive.

144
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,800
Yes! Then, make a contract for 100 million yen right away.

145
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,280
100 million yen?

146
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,360
Hmm, it might be possible if we make a contract.

147
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,520
Wait a minute, Ryan, you should look it up more carefully.

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,100
N-No, it's not like that.

149
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,880
Now is the time to read the contract.

150
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,620
If you miss this, the cruiser will belong to someone else.

151
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,460
I see. You're a fast winner.

152
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,860
That's right, sir.

153
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,520
Now, hurry up and sign here.

154
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,060
Well, wait a minute.

155
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,140
It might be a 1/1 kit plastic model.

156
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,800
Take it!

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,340
Well, it's a 1/1 kit plastic model.

158
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,180
Plastic model?

159
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,660
It's a water-cooled motor.

160
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,560
Are you going to use batteries to move it?

161
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
It's a 1/1 kit plastic model, and it's 30 cm long.

162
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,100
Are you going to sell such a bad plastic model for 10 million yen?

163
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,320
This is a joke.

164
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,120
The real one is here.

165
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
This is the real one.

166
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,920
This is also 10 million yen.

167
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,840
Wow, it's big and beautiful.

168
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,880
No, no, I don't know yet.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,680
That might be the bottom.

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,320
Now, hurry up and sign here.

171
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,920
If you keep moving it, you can sell it.

172
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,400
Yeah.

173
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,880
Look closely.

174
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,920
There's a mark that connects with another ship here.

175
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,100
I thought it was strange.

176
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,440
The outside is well deceived, but the bottom has a subtle change in color.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,840
No, this is a two-tone color that is popular now.

178
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't be silly.

179
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,400
The accident was a waste of money.

180
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,980
I'm sure you could connect the two.

181
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,440
I understand.

182
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,660
I'll make it cheap.

183
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,940
5 million yen.

184
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,160
It's expensive.

185
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,860
3 million yen.

186
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,680
Not yet.

187
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,600
2 million yen.

188
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,840
It's 1 million yen.

189
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,140
I won't give you a better one.

190
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,480
1 million yen.

191
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,240
It's okay.

192
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,160
1 million yen.

193
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,960
Yes.

194
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,220
Okay, fix this for 1 million yen.

195
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,560
Yes.

196
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,620
Okay, sign here.

197
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,740
Really?

198
00:08:59,740 --> 00:08:59,920
Really?

199
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,100
It's okay.

200
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

201
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,720
Is this okay?

202
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,840
Yes, it's okay.

203
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,780
I did it.

204
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,500
Now the cruiser is mine.

205
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,120
It's all thanks to me.

206
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,040
When you first open it, invite me to cruising for free.

207
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
Thank you, Ryo.

208
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
I didn't think I'd get it for 1 million yen.

209
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm glad we got the boat license and the marina.

210
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,680
Really?

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,420
Yes.

212
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,640
I can see Terai and his children enjoying it.

213
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,700
When it comes to cruising, I have a lot of fun memories.

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,360
Let's go, Ryo.

215
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,660
Now you go.

216
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,000
Me too.

217
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,960
Let's go.

218
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,400
Let's go.

219
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,280
The End

220
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,960
Hey, you guys!

221
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
Imagine something more public.

222
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,780
At least...

223
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,820
The End

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,380
Something like this.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,040
That's right.

226
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,940
Because the main character is Terai-san.

227
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,400
The End

228
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,620
The End

229
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
The End

230
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,780
The End

231
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,040
The End

232
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,460
The End

233
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,480
The End

234
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,700
Let's go!

235
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,900
Hey, wait a minute, Terai.

236
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,500
What?

237
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,720
Your name is not good.

238
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,840
Blue Max doesn't suit you at all.

239
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,320
What?

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,240
All right. This is fine.

241
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,960
Life-Sending Bant?

242
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,100
This is the perfect name for you.

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,680
No way.

244
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,620
We're in the water!

245
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,160
It's floating!

246
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,240
Of course!

247
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,420
Captain Eos!

248
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,780
I don't like it.

249
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,020
No...

250
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,240
When we go out to the sea,

251
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,160
the head of the ship is the most important.

252
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,180
Everyone!

253
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,880
You must listen to the captain!

254
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,260
Yes!

255
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,960
All the responsibility is on the captain.

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,260
All the responsibility is on me?

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,300
You're so tough.

258
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,080
All right.

259
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,780
Terai.

260
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,560
Show me the cabin before you go out.

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

262
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,080
Look. It's so big.

263
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,180
Here you go.

264
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,560
What?

265
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,220
It's big, isn't it?

266
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,240
It's twice the size of the previous house.

267
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,060
It's twice the size of the previous house.

268
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,420
It's twice the size of the previous house.

269
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:26,520
Damn it.

270
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,040
I was beaten.

271
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,180
I slept in a sleeping bag in the tent at night.

272
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,620
I made it with a sleeping bag at night.

273
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
It's really crazy.

274
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,040
It's the same as a camping site.

275
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,980
That's why it was that price.

276
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,820
That's why it was that price.

277
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,520
But Terai thinks this is the real thing.

278
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,460
But Terai thinks this is the real thing.

279
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,580
Let's keep quiet.

280
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes.

281
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,920
Let's keep quiet.

282
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,460
There are many ships.

283
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:50,880
There are many ships.

284
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,480
This is the only place near and cheap.

285
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,260
This is the only place near and cheap.

286
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,980
Oh?

287
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,660
It looks like we'll be hit on the left.

288
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,100
It looks like we'll be hit on the left.

289
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,660
Dad, this side is also hit.

290
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Don't return with the locker of the car.

291
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,160
It's a hard job to hit a human ship.

292
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,580
It's a right-right.

293
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,480
Terai, you are pretty good.

294
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,040
It's the first time.

295
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,140
But I found the line very good.

296
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,360
I-Is that so?

297
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,060
All right!

298
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,820
T-Tenai!

299
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,540
It's dangerous if you go too fast!

300
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,880
The sea also has obstacles!

301
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
Don't drive recklessly despite the selfishness of Mark!

302
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,060
This piercing feeling...

303
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm the captain!

304
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm the man of the sea!

305
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,280
T-Tenai!

306
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,000
Whoa! It's on!

307
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,940
Calm down!

308
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,640
Raise the rod and wind the reel!

309
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,900
Phew...

310
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,980
Me too!

311
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,660
Calm down and don't rush!

312
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,760
Yay!

313
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,980
I did it!

314
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,600
Amazing!

315
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,780
Whoa!

316
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,680
All right!

317
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,560
Then I'll grab the best sushi with this one!

318
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,800
Hmm...

319
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,800
I'll have this sushi with tempura and the horse mackerel with tataki!

320
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
I'll leave it to you, Ryo-chan!

321
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Yeah!

322
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,580
Wow, it's delicious!

323
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,380
The freshness is different, isn't it?

324
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,940
Right?

325
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,540
This is a taste you can't taste unless you go to the sea!

326
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,140
I didn't catch any...

327
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,200
But it was because I had my cruiser!

328
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,540
Well, that's true!

329
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,320
But there are a lot of cruisers and yachts out there!

330
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,100
And they're all very expensive!

331
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,720
Hello!

332
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,800
Oh, hello!

333
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,080
Wow, it looks delicious!

334
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,440
Sushi is a combination of freshly caught fish!

335
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,540
Well...

336
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,260
I see.

337
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,900
I don't have to leave this alone.

338
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,360
What?

339
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,140
You're going to deliver it with this cruiser?

340
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,400
What do you mean, Ryo-chan?

341
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,500
With this "Life Delivery Band"

342
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,960
You can go around the cruisers

343
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,260
And you can make sushi with freshly caught fish

344
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,620
Or you can make sashimi with it!

345
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,880
And you can deliver seafood and vegetables

346
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,700
Depending on your order

347
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,540
So it's called a "ocean convenience store"

348
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
But why would you do that?

349
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,140
Well...

350
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,700
It's to help the cruiser's "lone hell"

351
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,920
To help the cruiser's "lone hell"

352
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
To help the cruiser's "lone hell"

353
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,260
Right, "lone hell"?

354
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,560
Ryo-chan...

355
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Ufufu...

356
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,920
Every time we call you

357
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,360
For the cruisers and yachts who enjoy fishing and diving

358
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,560
Freshly caught fish

359
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,760
We'll make fresh sashimi and sushi

360
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,700
On the spot

361
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,880
Please feel free to call us

362
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,280
And other stuff like

363
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,880
Jet-ski, aqualung, goldfish bait

364
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,820
And mobile phone

365
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,020
A freshly caught fresh sashimi?

366
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,020
Sounds good

367
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,500
Hey!

368
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,580
Over here, please!

369
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,180
Yes, sir!

370
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,320
Over here, please!

371
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,360
Over here, please!

372
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,500
Hey, terai!

373
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,620
Get in between that cruiser and that cruiser!

374
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,260
Y-Yes!

375
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,940
Ah! You idiot! Over there!

376
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,740
Now!

377
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,320
Ah, we somehow got away.

378
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,800
Ah, my life is on the line!

379
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,800
Don't worry! Business is a crime!

380
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,060
No way!

381
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,520
He's like a demon.

382
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,760
You...

383
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,240
Here you are!

384
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,620
Here you are!

385
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,120
Do you want sashimi? Or sushi?

386
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,280
I guess sashimi is the best.

387
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,140
I'll take this.

388
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,540
Here you are!

389
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,840
Can I have some sushi?

390
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,520
Here you are!

391
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,580
Get ready to eat!

392
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,420
Don't just sit there.

393
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,800
Help your wife and children!

394
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,780
What?

395
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,080
It's for your daily wage!

396
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,340
I-I see.

397
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,260
Give me the money!

398
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,620
What? The money?

399
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,260
How nice.

400
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,220
How nice.

401
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,060
I'll have some sashimi.

402
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,760
Here you are!

403
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,280
Marmaid, sashimi!

404
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,420
Ah, Nakagawa!

405
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,760
I don't have money!

406
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,040
Make me work in Hokkaido!

407
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:19,900
Reiko!

408
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,540
Ten cakes, still on?

409
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,340
Ah, wife, smile a little more lovingly.

410
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,820
Terai!

411
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,260
You're in the way!

412
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,380
Oh...

413
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,760
51, 52...

414
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,520
Terai!

415
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm going to distribute sales!

416
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,280
Huh?

417
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,360
But I've made a lot of money.

418
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,680
Well, then I'll give you 5% of your income.

419
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,560
Thank you.

420
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,540
No matter how much you do, 5% is too much, senpai.

421
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,900
That's right. Why do you take 95% of it?

422
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,580
I came up with the idea.

423
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,260
I made sashimi, I grabbed sushi, plus there's a management fee.

424
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,060
That's terrible.

425
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,000
The ship belongs to you, so you have to make it at least 5%!

426
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,700
Ryo, at least you can get a repair fee.

427
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,800
I got it.

428
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,860
What's this, a repair fee?

429
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,000
Thank you.

430
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,400
Hey, poor people!

431
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,600
Shiratori Reiji!

432
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,320
Why are you wearing a coat in the middle of the summer?

433
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,460
It's hot and painful.

434
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,280
Aromani's jacket and coat.

435
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,720
The tie is made of plastic.

436
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,300
The shoes are made of leather.

437
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,380
The whole body is 10 million yen.

438
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,160
Even in the middle of the summer, good things are good.

439
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,920
More importantly, you seem to be talking about small money.

440
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,720
Take this!

441
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,920
I don't understand!

442
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,840
What is this?

443
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,220
It's not a child's bank account again.

444
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,640
My body just reacted.

445
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,040
Please, please, please!

446
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,120
By the way, I have a question.

447
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,420
What's that duck's foot boat floating in the lake?

448
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,300
Terrible! My cruiser!

449
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,320
Cruiser?

450
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,920
Hahaha!

451
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
Cruiser is the one that I'm riding, the super rich guy!

452
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,580
Kuhuhu!

453
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,820
It's true that the other side is many times bigger.

454
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,940
It's cool.

455
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,600
It doesn't look like it!

456
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,160
Both men and cruisers!

457
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,820
Oh, do you mean I can beat my life's money log?

458
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,460
Uh...

459
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,520
You...

460
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,640
Dad...

461
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,020
It can't be helped.

462
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,260
You see, that's not all there is to it.

463
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,400
That's the only way to win this battle.

464
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,400
What do you think?

465
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,800
Wow...

466
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,560
That dice...

467
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,780
That's ridiculous.

468
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,520
That's bad.

469
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not going to lose, man!

470
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,780
But I've put it to my body.

471
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm going to win!

472
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,300
So it's all on you!

473
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,240
I'll lose!

474
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,620
I have to win tonight!

475
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,460
That's right, I can't catch it!

476
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,560
Alright!

477
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,740
Ahh!

478
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,280
It seems to have been used up.

479
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,520
What kind of guy is it when it comes to driving a car?

480
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,280
That's right, I should have been careful with the Super-Karemochi!

481
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,540
Hey, get off!

482
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,400
Alright!

483
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,940
Good boy!

484
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
Wait for me, Reiko-san!

485
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,500
Bam!

486
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,140
Hooray!

487
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
It's finally starting to run!

488
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Damn it, it won't collapse!

489
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,500
It's catching up!

490
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,340
It's coming, Terai!

491
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,500
Get it to stop more!

492
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,220
Ahahaha!

493
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,580
Here we go!

494
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,660
Damn it, Terai!

495
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,720
It's slowly getting worse!

496
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,940
Up the speed a little!

497
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,740
I got it!

498
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh dear...

499
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,940
What's wrong, Terai?

500
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm drunk!

501
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,500
Are you alright, Mr. Terai?

502
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,280
No...

503
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,300
Are you alright, Mr. Terai?

504
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,480
You...

505
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,920
You, you...

506
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,840
Alright, you two, I'm counting on you!

507
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,140
Ryo-san, can you drive?

508
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,400
What? This is just like a car, right?

509
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Just a little bit here.

510
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
There you go. Let's go!

511
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,100
It's fast!

512
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,140
Go, go, go, go!

513
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,420
Go, go, go, go!

514
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,500
Alright, I can see it!

515
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,400
You've finally caught up!

516
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,360
Alright, speed up even more!

517
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,420
Wait up, you bastard!

518
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,960
That's it!

519
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
Take this!

520
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,500
How's that?

521
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,080
Damn, I can't keep up with speed!

522
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,000
You're not going anywhere!

523
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,140
Alright, let's have a little race!

524
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,500
Ryo!

525
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,860
Ryo!

526
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,760
Go, go, go, go!

527
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,620
Alright!

528
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,100
I'm out!

529
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,720
Go!

530
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,120
Alright!

531
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm out of here!

532
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,100
Take this!

533
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,000
Senpai!

534
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,100
In front!

535
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,800
Hm?

536
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,620
Huh?

537
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,720
Ryo!

538
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,680
Ryo!

539
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,860
Ryo!

540
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,580
Ryo!

541
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,500
Ryo!

542
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,000
Ryo!

543
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,680
Ryo!

544
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:21,880
Ryo!

545
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,280
Ryo!

546
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,320
Ryo!

547
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
Ryo!

548
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,660
Ryo!

549
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,380
Hey, are you alright?

550
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,440
Yeah, we're fine!

551
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,380
What the hell?

552
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,920
Aaaaaaah!

553
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,620
A

554
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm saved!

555
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,900
Can't get through!

556
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,780
Aah!

557
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,060
Aah!

558
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,720
