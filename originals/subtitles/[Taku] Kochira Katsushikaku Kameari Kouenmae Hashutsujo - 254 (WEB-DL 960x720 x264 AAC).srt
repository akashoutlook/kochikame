00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,260
One year ago

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,960
When you are watching TV, keep the room bright and watch your shows apart from one another.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,320
A poor man like me, he'll come to you.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,900
There isn't a place I can be alone in.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,760
But don't worry, look at the blue sky

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,880
The white clouds

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,920
They'll be okay eventually

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,840
They'll be okay eventually

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,260
Those who have no work, come to me

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,100
Look, it's burning

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,420
The red clouds

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,640
They'll be okay eventually

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,380
You got it?

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,580
You got it, you got it?

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,700
If you got it, then shut up and follow me!

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,240
Little Ryozu is a fairy

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,860
Why is it so hot?

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,820
My throat is dry

20
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,480
I'll drink some juice

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,520
Oh no!

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,760
What can you buy with 10 yen?

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,060
The 10 yen has grown!

24
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,960
Did I become smaller?

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,300
That's right, you idiot!

26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,420
You're a fool!

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,240
What do you think?

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,200
You're a flower!

29
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,480
You're making me small again!

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,480
That's dirty!

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Don't make me small!

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,420
Did I do something wrong?

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,380
You're so mean!

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,620
You already have 600 million coins!

35
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,940
600 million?

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,740
Look at this!

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,980
I'll let you off the hook!

38
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,020
Okay, I'm done!

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,960
Taking your boss's eye and eating it makes me very happy!

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,440
Bunny

41
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,480
Here!

42
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,700
It's you, you idiot!

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,840
Take this!

44
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,700
You idiot, stealing my small octopus

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
*Haha...*

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,260
*Haha...*

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,760
*Haha...*

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
*Haha...*

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,440
You don't distinguish garbage, you wash your pants in battle,

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,720
you crawl in the elevator,

51
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,200
you make a lot of ugly videos!

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,900
Well, that's what everyone else is doing!

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,380
You're a cop!

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,480
I can't stand to see you act like a villain anymore.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,580
Repent for a while.

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,220
You're a coward!

57
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,360
What? Don't be ridiculous!

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,000
Get back to your senses, you coward!

59
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,680
I won't do you any favors!

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,800
I'll give you a hard time!

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
*Haha...*

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,620
What are you going to do?

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,360
Stop it, old man!

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,080
*Haha...*

65
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,720
*Haha...*

66
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,060
Don't tell me...

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,060
Stop it!

68
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
*Haha...*

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,140
*Haha...*

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,960
*Haha...*

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,780
*Haha...*

72
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,560
*Haha...*

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
*Haha...*

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,040
*Haha...*

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
*Haha...*

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
*Haha...*

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,300
*Haha...*

78
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,820
*Haha...*

79
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,920
*Haha...*

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,180
*Haha...*

81
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,820
Damn it!

82
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,580
Director Kobayashi!

83
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,960
He did his mistake because of me!

84
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,540
Damn it, I'm so angry!

85
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Director Kobayashi, you idiot!

86
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,740
C-Come again!

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,060
Uwaaaah !

88
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,400
Uwaaaah !

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,760
Uwaaah !

90
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,220
Uwaaaah !

91
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,120
Uwaaaah !

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Damn it, I almost died...

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,980
I-I managed to survive.

94
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,060
Phew...

95
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,680
But I'm done for.

96
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,100
There's no one else to bring me back to normal except Hanayama.

97
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,400
And I don't want to lower my head.

98
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,520
Hm?

99
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,180
I smell something burned.

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,000
Hm?

101
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,880
Uwaaah !

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,640
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

103
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,760
Help...

104
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,540
Damn, those who threw away the cigarette can't get the punishment!

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,200
Huh?

106
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,580
Dad.

107
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,960
Where are you waiting for me?

108
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,300
Where are we waiting for you?

109
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,620
Never again.

110
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm glad you're okay.

111
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm glad you're okay.

112
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm glad you're okay.

113
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm glad you're okay.

114
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm glad you're okay.

115
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,580
I'm glad you're okay.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,860
Isn't that a bit dangerous?

117
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,800
Uwaaaah !

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,860
Damn, I didn't have time to look at it!

119
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,980
You shouldn't be doing this.

120
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,000
You should have gone back to the beginning.

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,560
Uwaaah !

122
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,060
Damn!

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm going to change my gum this time!

124
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm the cockroach!

125
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,860
Damn it.

126
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,140
Damn, the cockroach!

127
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,180
Ah, ah, ah.

128
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,140
... However, if you walk, you'll never walk far, even if you're far away.

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,080
I'd better have some rest.

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,300
Uwaaah !

131
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,620
Meow!

132
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,560
Meow!

133
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,440
Help!

134
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,080
Finally, I escaped.

135
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,540
But I got away from the escape room again.

136
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Ryo-tsu is still not working.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,080
If I find him, I'll beat him to death.

138
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm sure he's playing somewhere.

139
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,240
Boss, I'm here!

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
It's me, it's me, Boss!

141
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm here, Boss!

142
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,020
Didn't you hear Ryo-tsu's voice?

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,900
No, I didn't hear anything.

144
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,860
I see. It's just my imagination.

145
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,360
Boss, don't do that.

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,340
He'll get caught.

147
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,080
I'll be back.

148
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,180
I'll be back.

149
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,340
I'll be back.

150
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,620
I'll be back.

151
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,720
I'll be back.

152
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,300
I'll be back.

153
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,880
I'll be back.

154
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,340
I'll be back.

155
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,760
I'll be back.

156
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,160
Hey.

157
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,380
Ah.

158
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,840
You don't read books, do you?

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,420
Do you want to play soccer together?

160
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,280
Eh? Ah...

161
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,780
Um, umm, I...

162
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,280
What?

163
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,020
I can't do this. What should I do?

164
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm so tired. I can't move anymore.

165
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,440
Hmm...

166
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,820
Wow!

167
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,640
Could it be a real fairy?

168
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,200
What, is it all a dream?

169
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,860
That's right. I can't believe you made it so small.

170
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
What is this?

171
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,840
I, I can't believe...

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
Where am I?

173
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
Ah, you're awake?

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,140
Who are you? Where am I?

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,220
I'm Shoichi. This is my room.

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,740
The fairy made me hungry and fell down so I brought her here.

177
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,720
What? A fairy is like me.

178
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,700
Yeah.

179
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,240
See? It's exactly like the fairy in this book.

180
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,880
Hmm...

181
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,460
No, it's not like me at all.

182
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
No matter where I look, it's not like me at all.

183
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,240
Ah, that's right.

184
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,420
A fairy must not reveal her true identity.

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,400
It's written in the book.

186
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,500
Yeah.

187
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,780
I can't keep up with you anymore. I'm going home.

188
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,160
Ah!

189
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,020
This is the 32nd floor.

190
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,580
Hurry up and tell me!

191
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,700
If I fall, I'll die!

192
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,520
Eh? Isn't the fairy able to fly?

193
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,360
It's not a fairy!

194
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,680
Ah, so you were hungry.

195
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:17,700
Eat this.

196
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,760
Oh?

197
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,880
Can I eat this?

198
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,140
Yeah.

199
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,880
So, um, instead...

200
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,100
Um, um...

201
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,460
Huh?

202
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,740
Um, um...

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,400
Can you be my friend?

204
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,580
Friend?

205
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,120
Yeah! I'll give you food, and I'll give you lunch.

206
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,100
Right? No?

207
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,800
Hmm...

208
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,920
It's not the time to be relaxed here.

209
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm not free in this body.

210
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,500
If I'm with you, I can eat for free.

211
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,820
Yeah, I can't help it.

212
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,040
I'll stay here a little longer.

213
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Really? Thank you!

214
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,860
What's wrong?

215
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,420
See? You're not following me at all!

216
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,420
Hehehe.

217
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,540
Here we go!

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,140
Wow! You're amazing!

219
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,520
Here we go!

220
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,940
Shoot!

221
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,060
Go!

222
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,180
Yes!

223
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,900
What? It's no good at all.

224
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,060
I can't be your opponent.

225
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,820
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,780
This is the first time I've ever been with someone.

227
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,000
What?

228
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,140
Are you playing alone?

229
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,460
Um...

230
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,260
Hmm... I can't help it.

231
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,240
All right! I'll do it again!

232
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
What? Really?

233
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,540
Yeah. It's my thanks for the dinner.

234
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,700
I'll tell you how to win this game.

235
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,160
Wow! Really?

236
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,500
As expected of a fairy!

237
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,320
You know everything.

238
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm not a fairy!

239
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,360
You're not a fairy!

240
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,360
You're not a fairy!

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,380
You're not a fairy!

242
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,080
You're not a fairy!

243
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,260
You're not a fairy!

244
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
You're not a fairy!

245
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,000
You're not a fairy!

246
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,240
You're not a fairy!

247
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,940
You're not a fairy!

248
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,360
You're not a fairy!

249
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,400
You're not a fairy!

250
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,600
You're not a fairy!

251
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,340
You're not a fairy!

252
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,620
You're not a fairy!

253
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,140
You're not a fairy!

254
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,360
No, you're not a fairy!

255
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,100
He's a fairy!

256
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,180
What's that?

257
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,660
Hey, it's nothing.

258
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:28,220
DDGlessing?

259
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,160
Hey, Shouichi! Good morning!

260
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,560
Let's go.

261
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,340
Hey, answer me!

262
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,580
B-but I can't speak well...

263
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,460
I'm embarrassed...

264
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,060
So I can't speak...

265
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,820
Shouichi, you can't make friends because you say so much!

266
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,140
That's why you can't make friends, right?

267
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,040
I'm talking to him right now, so all I have to do is answer him.

268
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,440
But I'm...

269
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,520
Hey, what should I do?

270
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,580
Oh, right! I wonder if I can do something with the fairy's magic!

271
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,760
You can do it!

272
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,100
It can't be helped if you make friends with magic!

273
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,460
That's right.

274
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,020
What should I do?

275
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,620
I got it, I got it. I'll help you.

276
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,860
Really?

277
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,660
Leave it to me.

278
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,660
But you know what? I'll help you, but it's up to you whether you can make friends or not.

279
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,140
Got it?

280
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
Ryo, you're coming again today?

281
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,880
Ryo hasn't been back since yesterday.

282
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,060
What?

283
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,360
I haven't heard of him going on a trip, but he suddenly disappeared.

284
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,060
Did something happen to him?

285
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,360
Oh, well, he must be selling oil somewhere again.

286
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,400
He's really been slacking off lately.

287
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,380
I have to teach him a lesson and get him back on his feet.

288
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,220
All right, let's go!

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah!

290
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,980
All right!

291
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,540
Now, that's the first strategy: say hello in the morning!

292
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,100
Yeah!

293
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Hello...

294
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,040
Hey, I'm just saying hello!

295
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,720
You're listening? Hey, you, just answer!

296
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,640
I've never been so nervous before!

297
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,640
Okay! Who can solve this problem?

298
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,880
See? The second strategy!

299
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,260
Raise your hands while you're in class!

300
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,380
Raise your hands now!

301
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,280
But it's embarrassing...

302
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,860
I told you not to cry!

303
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,320
N-no way...

304
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm so frustrated...

305
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
You're the cat from yesterday!

306
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,920
The last one, Miyahara!

307
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,620
I knew it wouldn't work...

308
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,000
It's not just that!

309
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,940
Do something about that!

310
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,520
What's that cat doing here?

311
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,560
Okay! The third strategy!

312
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,080
Invite everyone to class!

313
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,740
Go on!

314
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,500
Okay...

315
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,340
What's wrong? Go on!

316
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,240
Move, Giant Shoichi!

317
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,180
B-but... it's embarrassing...

318
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,400
Idiot!

319
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,300
You can't make friends with that kind of thing!

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,300
If you don't do it, there's nothing you can do!

321
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,200
I-I know... I know... but my body is...

322
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,400
Hey, lend me a ball...

323
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,100
Thanks!

324
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,160
Hey! What are you doing?

325
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,960
Are you motivated?

326
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,160
B-but...

327
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,400
Ugh...

328
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,160
Ugh...

329
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,840
We're working on it right now.

330
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,840
You can do it later.

331
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,840
You know, Shoichi...

332
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,220
Don't make me say it again!

333
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Right now, I'm...

334
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,180
Hey, let me go!

335
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,980
Help me!

336
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,560
This way!

337
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,780
Miss Fairy!

338
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,180
Hey!

339
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,860
Miss Fairy!

340
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,360
Are you okay?

341
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,580
I'm fine...

342
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,700
I see...

343
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,980
You're really pathetic!

344
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,820
You couldn't do anything after all, huh!

345
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,260
Y-yeah...

346
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,840
Do you really think you can make friends by just running away?

347
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,280
You just have to talk to me!

348
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,460
You can play with everyone if you do that!

349
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,500
If you can't do that, you're alone in your life!

350
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,600
Do you get it?

351
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,100
No... I'm...

352
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,020
What?

353
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,900
You don't have to make friends with me anymore.

354
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,620
It's fine. I have a fairy.

355
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,820
Shoichi, you...

356
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,120
If I have a fairy, I won't be alone!

357
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Right? You'll always be by my side, right?

358
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,140
Don't joke!

359
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,780
I've never had a child like you!

360
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,200
Friends are no joke!

361
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,820
I don't care about you anymore!

362
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,280
See ya!

363
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,560
No, fairy!

364
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,020
F-fairy...

365
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,940
Okay, anyone who can read this kanji?

366
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,820
Wait, how pathetic of him.

367
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,880
He shouldn't have cared about that guy and should have gone home.

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,340
Okay, anyone who can do the next question?

369
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,200
See, it's exactly the same as the fairy in this book!

370
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,520
Oh, you were hungry, weren't you?

371
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,120
Eat this!

372
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,780
Wow, you're amazing, fairy!

373
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,720
I-I'm sorry, this is the first time I've ever said "someone".

374
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
Hey, line up! Line up!

375
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,520
Let's eat!

376
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,360
Let's eat!

377
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,760
The lunch we're having soon won't be the same as the lunch at the family restaurant!

378
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,480
Huh?

379
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,840
Fairy-san!

380
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,120
You came home?

381
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,240
Well, it was a promise to let me eat.

382
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,600
That's right.

383
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,280
Shouichi, show us your guts this time!

384
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,340
Okay!

385
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,500
Listen, Shouichi.

386
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,280
This is your last strategy.

387
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
The one who played an active part in the gym is a class hero.

388
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,020
You have to get excited and shoot!

389
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,360
Yeah, but...

390
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,080
But what?

391
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,960
I'm not good at sports.

392
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,700
I taught you yesterday!

393
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,260
It's the same as the game!

394
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,500
Don't look away from the ball!

395
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,580
Leave the rest to me!

396
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,300
Huh? No way...

397
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,800
Look! The ball is coming!

398
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,640
Idiot! What are you avoiding?

399
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,640
Get a good trap!

400
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,640
But...

401
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,800
Don't be so stubborn!

402
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,440
Chase the ball!

403
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,220
Yes, sir!

404
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,740
Thanks!

405
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,100
OK, I got it!

406
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,580
Good!

407
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,660
I got it!

408
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,080
It's coming!

409
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,120
You did it!

410
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,740
Yes! Triple, Shouichi!

411
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,600
Yes!

412
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,840
Three in front!

413
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:23,920
To the left!

414
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,380
Keep it up, Shouichi!

415
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,340
Stop!

416
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,800
Right!

417
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,220
Left!

418
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
That's amazing!

419
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,960
-Wow! -It's true!

420
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,260
-There's another one! -Cheers!

421
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,460
-There's another one! -Cheers!

422
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,320
Can you hear me? Everyone's cheering for you!

423
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,040
Yeah!

424
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,540
-Wow! -Wow!

425
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,160
Alright, trap and shoot!

426
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,880
Alright!

427
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,240
Hit it!

428
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,580
Shoichi!

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,860
That was amazing, Shoichi!

430
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,700
I've never seen a dribble like that before!

431
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
You were hiding something you're good at!

432
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,940
Oh, what?

433
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,240
That's right.

434
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
It's a trick.

435
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,100
Ms. Fairy...

436
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,380
Did you come to make friends for me?

437
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,600
Thank you, Ms. Fairy.

438
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,020
Alright, the match is over!

439
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,140
Hurry up!

440
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah!

441
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,660
"Chess"

442
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,900
He's quite a lively guy, isn't he?

443
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,440
I'll get him back to normal soon enough.

444
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,360
"Battle Państrum"

445
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,600
Finally! It's the F Dios!

446
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:27,980
"The Fellowship"

447
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,640
Yes!

448
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,600
Banzai!

449
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm back! I'm back to normal! Banzai!

450
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,800
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

451
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,540
Ryo-chan, where did you really go?

452
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,980
You got caught up in a big case, didn't you?

453
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,560
No way!

454
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,300
I'm sure he's thinking of excuses to get rid of me!

455
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,440
When he comes back, I'll tell him this and that!

456
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,960
Buz-chan!

457
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,460
Ryo-chan!

458
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,180
Buz-chan!

459
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,700
Reiko! Nagagawa!

460
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Ryo-chan!

461
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,640
Senpai!

462
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,500
Buz-chan!

463
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,340
Ryo-chan!

464
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,040
This idiot was in the way until now!

465
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,660
Buz-chan, there's no reason for this!

466
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Kikumi-mon!

467
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,180
Please listen to me, Buz-chan!

468
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,140
No excuses!

469
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,360
Where are you walking?

470
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,620
You're not listening to me, Buz-chan!

471
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,960
Wow, Shouichi! What a hot trick!

472
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,200
It's a trick! Let's play soccer again!

473
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,040
Yes!

474
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,180
Fairy! Help me!

475
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,860
Oh, it's summer again this year!

476
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,640
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

477
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,200
Oh, it's summer again this year!

478
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,980
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

479
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,920
I see!

480
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,500
It's big, small, big, small,

481
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:27,920
Out of the way!

482
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,580
Big, small, big,

483
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,400
In the southern wind!

484
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,840
It's big, small, small,

485
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,060
In the southern wind!

486
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,820
It's big, small, small,

487
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,600
It's large, small!

488
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:36,760
In the southern wind!

489
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,600
Oh, it's summer again this year!

490
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,640
It's here, it's here, it's here!

491
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,440
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

492
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,740
Oh, it's summer again this year!

493
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,420
It's here, it's here!

494
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,600
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

495
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,800
It's here! It's here! It's here!

496
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,320
Oh, it's summer again this year!

497
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,580
It's huge, small, small,

498
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:50,980
Out of the way!

499
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,780
In the southern wind!

500
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,560
Nagisabe

501
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,240
Nagisabe

502
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,820
Nagisabe

503
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,760
Nagisabe

504
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,060
Nagisabe

505
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,100
Nagisabe

506
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,480
Nagisabe

507
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,740
Nagisabe

508
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
Nagisabe

509
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:24,860
Nagisabe

510
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,080
What? A cursed camera?

511
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,280
You said that I'd be unhappy if I didn't take 100 pictures of your swimsuit within a week?

512
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,020
It's not that easy!

513
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,440
Wait a minute! I'll take as many pictures as you want!

514
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,560
Get a swimsuit picture!

515
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,700
I'm counting on you!

516
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,740
There's a turtle over there

517
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,960
There's a turtle for sure

518
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,060
There's a turtle for sure

519
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,720
Everyone come to our town

520
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
