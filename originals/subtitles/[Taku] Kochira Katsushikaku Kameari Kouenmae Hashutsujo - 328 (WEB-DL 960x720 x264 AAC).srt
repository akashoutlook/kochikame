Genki Bakusi

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,760
Who is this guy??

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,680
What's wrong with everyone?

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,820
Idiot! Why is he leaning his head like that?

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,460
A new invention, developed from the nations, has been announced by the chief.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,560
New invention? What is it?

36
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,080
What about Reiko?

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,820
What's wrong with Reiko?

38
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,040
Come to think of it, I haven't seen her for a while.

39
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,080
Did she miss out on something?

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,560
Not you! It's Reiko!

41
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,460
There must be a reason for it.

42
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,860
It's starting!

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,500
Listen, don't make a fuss!

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
Yes, yes, I understand.

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,680
Today, we have a new invention

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,700
developed by the Katsushika office.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,960
It's to show off the new Super Power Assist Suit, Otasuke-kun.

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,000
Otasuke-kun?

49
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,120
What a simple name.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,420
What's a Power Assist Suit?

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,520
It's a machine that can easily move heavy objects

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,980
even for women and people with weak strength.

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,180
When you move a patient from bed to the wheelchair,

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
it's easy for anyone who has been doing it for two to do it.

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,420
I see.

56
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,680
It's something we need in the future.

57
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,620
Then, Professor Korosuke Ezaki,

58
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:01,800
please.

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,800
What?

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,300
I have a bad feeling about this.

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,880
What?

62
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,920
What's going on?

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,600
Ladies and gentlemen!

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,400
Ladies and gentlemen!

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,700
One, two, three, come out here!

66
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,300
Please welcome the Super Illusion of Professor Korosuke Ezaki!

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,460
A-Reiko!

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,380
You weren't in the room because of me?

69
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,700
I'm afraid this is what you've been asked for.

70
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,540
This is what I think it is.

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,300
This genius magician,

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,380
another legendary scientist,

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,620
The science scientist, Ezaghi Korosuke, developed it.

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,520
Reiko, who helped him, has now become an invincible superwoman!

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,640
If you run, you can run faster than a ball!

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
If you have power, you can be stronger than a machine!

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,160
And you can build tall buildings!

78
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,020
I've heard of something like that before.

79
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,120
It's suspicious of Ezaghi's invention.

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,880
Oh, so that's Gorilla-kun.

81
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,360
I guess he's suspicious of my ability.

82
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,740
Good.

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,220
I'll go out and have a match!

84
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a match!

85
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,140
It's arm wrestling, finger wrestling, mangle wrestling, anything!

86
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,640
All right, that's interesting!

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,360
Ryo-tsu, don't use your stupid strength to break it!

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,740
All right, let's have a match with arm wrestling!

89
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,440
Be gentle, Ryo-chan.

90
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,180
You know, it's Ryo-tsu Gorilla-kun vs. Super Beauty F-cup, Reiko-kun's match.

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,060
Watch carefully!

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,280
If I win, I'll have everyone here have lunch!

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,680
Then I'll go!

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
Ready, go!

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,720
That's a great power combo!

96
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,060
Oh, so that's why you're putting in the effort, Ryo-chan.

97
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,940
What?

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,940
Damn it! Then I'll do it seriously!

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
Oh, no!

100
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,780
It's all right.

101
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,680
Oh, no!

102
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Then I'll put in a little effort.

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,200
I can't believe you lost.

104
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,020
I just put in a little effort.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,740
Are you okay, Ryo-chan?

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,780
If it wasn't for me, my bones would've been broken.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,200
But still, it's a great power.

108
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,780
How's that, Gorilla-kun?

109
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,120
Do you accept Ota-suke-kun's ability?

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,100
Yeah, I do.

111
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,940
It's a great power.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,900
In a week, we'll have to show it to the general.

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,120
With this much power, it'll be useful.

114
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,040
Now I can make a profit.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,880
Ryo-tsu became Ota-suke-kun's monitor?

116
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,660
Yes.

117
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:10,900
That's right.

118
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,860
Professor Ezaki sold him to him.

119
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,040
He says he'll live off of Ota-suke-kun for a week.

120
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm sure he's up to something.

121
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,760
Hello, this is Ryo-san's Zenigami moving van.

122
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,180
The study desk is on the second floor of the children's room.

123
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,260
The TV and the toilet set is in the living room.

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,920
The table is in the dining room.

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes, I understand.

126
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,500
I'll finish it in five minutes.

127
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,540
In five minutes?

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,260
But only one person can do it.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,040
Leave it to me.

130
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,140
Move, move!

131
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,240
No matter how much you move, it's like a powerless house.

132
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,820
Hey, Gojyujin!

133
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,480
Huh?

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,640
Whoa!

135
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm in the way, so I'll stand here for a while.

136
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,700
Whoa!

137
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,120
Hello!

138
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm here to deliver the Africa's first-class.

139
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,940
This is Ryo-san's Zenigami moving van.

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes, it's here, it's here!

141
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,500
Please leave the moving van to the Zenigami moving van.

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,860
Please leave the moving van to the Zenigami moving van.

143
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,940
Please leave the moving van to the Zenigami moving van.

144
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,620
That's good.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
If you go like this, you'll be rich in no time.

146
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,460
What?

147
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,360
The elevator is broken?

148
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,020
The moving destination is the top 10th floor.

149
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,640
It's not efficient to use the stairs.

150
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,460
Tomorrow is the day of the public display at the police station.

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,040
I want to make as much money as possible by today.

152
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,400
Hmm.

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Hmm?

154
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,420
Hmm.

155
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,380
The distance is roughly 30 meters.

156
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,240
That's a good distance.

157
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,600
That's a good distance.

158
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,700
All right!

159
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,300
Ta!

160
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,980
Dorya!

161
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,320
Ta!

162
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,820
Dorya!

163
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,120
Dorya!

164
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,580
Dorya!

165
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,240
Dorya!

166
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,080
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,760
I can't hold it anymore.

168
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,640
It doesn't feel good.

169
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,140
It doesn't feel good.

170
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,180
Oh!

171
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm sorry!

172
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,580
It's warped.

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
It's warped!

174
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,240
You're sorry.

175
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,740
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,980
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,240
No, it's not.

178
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm saved!

179
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,920
What the hell happened?

180
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh no! The control computer is broken!

181
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,220
No! I can't fix it!

182
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,620
I'm screwed. If I say I broke it, I'll get a penalty.

183
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,820
I think I'm getting a lot of money.

184
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,020
Besides, it's about Ezaki. I can't just pay for it.

185
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,980
I have no choice but to cheat.

186
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,880
Oh, here it is!

187
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

188
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
I was a little sleepy.

189
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,900
Hey, Ryo-chan. Show the general officer the power of your help.

190
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
Be careful, Ryo-chan.

191
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,860
Ryo-chan, I'll be careful. Okay?

192
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,840
I know.

193
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,280
I don't need to be here.

194
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,260
Did you say something?

195
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,520
No, it's nothing.

196
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,000
Battery charging is OK.

197
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,120
Professor Ezaki.

198
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,680
Then please bring the example.

199
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,640
Yes.

200
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,740
Please carry all this iron skeleton 50 meters away.

201
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,860
The time limit is 30 seconds.

202
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,420
You're going to carry it there in 30 seconds?

203
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm not ready, Gorilla-kun.

204
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,660
Ryo-chan's power plus the help's power will be reduced.

205
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,920
Let's start! Ready, go!

206
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,400
What a weight!

207
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,360
Ouch!

208
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,240
You seem to be a little lost.

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,020
Gorilla-kun's joke is a joke.

210
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
See ya, Gorilla-kun!

211
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,000
Even if you do this, you're OK with the help.

212
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,580
Stop!

213
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,940
I'll bother you with each one.

214
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,600
Ouch!

215
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,760
Ouch!

216
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,580
Gyaaaaaa!

217
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,260
*Gasps*

218
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,200
*Groans*

219
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,720
*Groans*

220
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,740
*Groans*

221
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,300
30 seconds, just!

222
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,980
Are you tired?

223
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,140
Not at all!

224
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,660
Next is the speed test.

225
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,900
*Groans*

226
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,160
10 kg of iron array

227
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,940
on both hands and legs, just like this!

228
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,860
Oh, wonderful!

229
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,900
*Groans*

230
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,660
*Groans*

231
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,480
Alright, Gorilla-kun!

232
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
Let's add one more iron array.

233
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,740
*Groans*

234
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,560
If you have the power,

235
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,900
you can pull this big trailer

236
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,060
and run 100 meters in 10 seconds!

237
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Impossible.

238
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,240
No matter how hard I try,

239
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,140
I'm at my limit!

240
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,140
*Groans*

241
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
*Groans*

242
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,760
*Groans*

243
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
I can't reach the chain yet!

244
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,260
Senpai, you're too fast!

245
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,520
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?!

246
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm just helping you!

247
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,980
*Groans*

248
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,720
*Groans*

249
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,280
I can't stop! I can't turn!

250
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
*Groans*

251
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,060
*Groans*

252
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,920
Senpai! Ryo-chan!

253
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,880
*Groans*

254
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,440
Somebody stop me!

255
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,660
*Groans*

256
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,940
*Groans*

257
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,640
*Groans*

258
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,920
*Groans*

259
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,240
*Groans*

260
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,280
*Groans*

261
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
*Groans*

262
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,540
*Groans*

263
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,620
*Groans*

264
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,080
*Groans again*

265
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
*Groans one more time*

266
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,800
*Groans*

267
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,520
* Expansion*

268
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,500
*Music stops*

269
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,340
*Music stops*

270
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,480
I must finish my work!

271
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,180
I can only hear the music.

272
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
You're right, Papa. It's like music.

273
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,480
My daughter is like a terrible poet.

274
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't like it, Papa.

275
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,780
Oh, my God. What's so fun?

276
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,480
Well, well, this girl is...

277
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
It's okay. Let's have tea.

278
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,940
Oh, that's unfair. You want to have a snack with me?

279
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,800
You're a child forever.

280
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,680
No! It's not my fault!

281
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,500
Senpai is now moving to Nerima at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour.

282
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,280
He's moving straight from the start point.

283
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,060
What's going on?

284
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,200
I didn't know you had such a defect.

285
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,580
This is not a defect.

286
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,540
You can work even when you're asleep.

287
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Your learning mode is now in line with Gorilla's behavior pattern!

288
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,340
I see. So that's what it is.

289
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,680
Then how do you stop it?

290
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,680
You can't stop it?

291
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,260
If I just keep going straight, I'll be able to cross the Kanjou Line 8.

292
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
Are you going to Mejiro Street?

293
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,780
Wait, if you say you're going to Mejiro Street...

294
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,640
Oh, no! If I keep going straight, Ryo-chan will get stuck in that gas tank!

295
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,160
What?

296
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,480
I knew it.

297
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,000
If I keep going straight, it's going to be a big deal.

298
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,600
I have to stop Gorilla-kun's rush somehow.

299
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,440
Is there a good way?

300
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,620
Alright, let's go with this strategy.

301
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,500
What strategy?

302
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
Give me a name.

303
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,300
A big trap!

304
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,700
Alright! Do it! Hurry!

305
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,840
Make a huge trap and drop Gorilla-kun here.

306
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,960
Since I'm helping you, Gorilla-kun can only go straight.

307
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,740
This is a success, no doubt about it!

308
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,340
The digging is over!

309
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,640
Alright, put on your seat belts.

310
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,760
Yes, sir!

311
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,540
It's only about three minutes until the senior arrives at the scene.

312
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,360
It's only about three minutes until the senior arrives at the scene.

313
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,280
It's only about three minutes until the senior arrives at the scene.

314
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,040
Hurry! Hurry up!

315
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,460
The big trap is done!

316
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,740
Alright!

317
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,980
Here he comes!

318
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,700
All right!

319
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,340
Thanks for the hard work, Ryo-kun.

320
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm usted.

321
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,660
I did it!

322
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,680
It went well!

323
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,100
That's just what I envisioned.

324
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,340
I guess I'm old. But it's finally stopped now.

325
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,820
No, no, stop! Stop this!

326
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,160
Ow, ow, ow!

327
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,940
Ow, ow, ow!

328
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,120
Ow, ow, ow!

329
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,960
It's Ryo!

330
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,400
What the heck!

331
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,780
The trap is a failure! Senpai is still heading for the gas tank!

332
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,820
What?!

333
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,920
I-I can't hold on to the gas!

334
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,240
I have to do something!

335
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,700
I have to do something!

336
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,760
Damn it! I can't even move my hands or feet!

337
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,700
Oh, I see. I can move my neck freely.

338
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,340
Alright!

339
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,380
I'll take it myself!

340
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,500
No, no, no, no, no! Stop it!

341
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,880
I only got extra speed with my centrifugal force!

342
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,800
Senpai and the gas tank are only a kilometer apart!

343
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,720
Oh...

344
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,200
Professor Ezaki, anything else you want to say?

345
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,380
You're so good, Gorilla. But this is just a matter of time.

346
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,840
The next step will be...

347
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,300
A great strategy to blow away the starboard at once!

348
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm going to blow Gorilla-kun away with that iron ball and change its direction!

349
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,560
There's no doubt that this will be a success!

350
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,640
I'm ready!

351
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,500
Senpai is coming!

352
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,140
Alright!

353
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,980
Begin attack!

354
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,580
Begin attack!

355
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,540
What the hell is this! What a hell!

356
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,860
What! What the hell is this!

357
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,020
It was so good!

358
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,140
I can't get away from this! Damn it!

359
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,460
I'm done for!

360
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,040
Damn it! I'm running again!

361
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,460
You did well! The direction has changed!

362
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,900
I'm glad!

363
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,840
So good!

364
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,840
Right?

365
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,020
Let's go!

366
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,740
The plan is a success!

367
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,860
We did it!

368
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,000
Wait a minute.

369
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,980
This direction is bad!

370
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,400
There's a gas station!

371
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,300
What? Is that true, Nakagawa?

372
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,880
Professor Eizaki!

373
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm not sure about that.

374
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,040
Next is...

375
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,120
Super strong electromagnetic magnet stop!

376
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,480
Ota-suke-kun, great plan!

377
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,560
Start!

378
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm going to suck up Gorilla-kun with the super strong electromagnetic magnet.

379
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,000
This time, it will be a success for sure.

380
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,320
Are you ready?

381
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,040
Alright, let's start the plan.

382
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,420
Alright! Super strong electromagnetic magnet, get ready!

383
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,740
Super strong electromagnetic magnet, switch on!

384
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,200
Switch on!

385
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,400
What is this?

386
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,600
What is this?

387
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,020
Good!

388
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,240
Now, power up!

389
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,820
Power up!

390
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,620
Yes!

391
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,540
Power up!

392
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:39,980
Power up!

393
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,400
It's annoying!

394
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,980
Oh, I'm back!

395
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,480
Good!

396
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,820
Everything is as I expected!

397
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,460
I'm back!

398
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,080
Ah, ugh!

399
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,720
The magnet is going to suck up other cars, not just Ryo-chan!

400
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,260
Oh, still, Cinderella!

401
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,120
What?

402
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,520
Oh...

403
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,300
Uwaaah!

404
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,560
I won't be broken!

405
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,840
I can't make it!

406
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,120
What?

407
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,820
Uwaaah!

408
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,060
Please do something!

409
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,320
Uwaaah!

410
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,540
Huh?

411
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,600
I slipped on the banana peel.

412
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Hoho, this is also a matter of calculation.

413
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,440
Liar!

414
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,120
Senpai!

415
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,180
Natchan!

416
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
When will it stop? Stop it.

417
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,260
It seems that the battery can be used for five consecutive days.

418
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,840
Five days is nothing.

419
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,760
Damn it!

420
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,260
Uwaaah!

421
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,100
Uwaaah!

422
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,960
Wait!

423
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,500
What?

424
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,700
What?

425
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,140
What?

426
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,800
Who stopped this?

427
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,300
Who?

428
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,540
What should I do?

429
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,700
Uwaaah!

430
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,600
It hurts!

431
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,520
Stop!

432
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,080
Uwaaah!

433
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,640
Uwaaah!

434
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:38,660
Hey!

435
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,260
Stop it!

436
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,780
I'm sleepy!

437
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,760
10 games, 10 games, 5 times택

438
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
With a slipper and a water fish

439
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,360
10 games, 10 games, 5 times택

440
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
With a slipper and a water fish

441
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,580
Always sandals, always scandals

442
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,220
Don't worry about it

443
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,220
"I don't have one"

444
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,420
Play with your own nails

445
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,120
Everyday

446
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,700
I've put my boredom in a

447
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:11,960
"I don't have one"

448
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,080
"I don't have one"

449
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,900
"I don't have one"

450
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:17,960
"I don't have one"

451
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,480
"I don't have one"

452
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,280
"I don't have one"

453
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:20,860
"I don't have one"

454
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,340
"I don't have one"

455
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,300
"I don't have one"

456
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,160
"I don't have one"

457
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,160
"I don't have one"

458
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,200
"I don't have one"

459
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,420
"I don't have one"

460
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,540
"I am very excited!"

461
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:28,820
"Amazing"

462
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,460
"The lightning in the Sheep Hunt is like a smoke"

463
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,420
"If I run and run, I will be a educación"

464
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,260
"But I'm in a good Canvas"

465
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,520
"With a big dose of carbon monoxide " "I

466
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,680
don't know who to watch out for" "I

467

Where I sleep

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,040
Ya, Murakoji, Murakoji, Paiko, Paiko, Paiko

480
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,140
Shurinkan, Shurinkan's Kururindai

00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,080
Kururindai's Ponpoko, Ponpoko's Tiro, Ponpoko's Na

482
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,880
The super-sounding Chosuke!

483
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,120
The Olympics?

484
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
I wonder if I'll wake that guy up soon

485
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,820
Higurashi, wake up!

486
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,140
Huh? He's not here

487
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,440
Hey, don't you know the Higurashi I left here?

488
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,720
Hey, did someone move it on their own?

489
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,700
Next time, "Higurashi, 3000 Ryo"

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,600
See you next time!
