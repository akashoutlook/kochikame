1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,920
When watching TV, brighten the room to let it look as bright as you can!

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to my place, everyone who's short of money!

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, either, yet I'm worried

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,420
You'll be able to do something somehow

6
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,460
You'll be able to do something somehow

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,360
If you don't have a job, come to my place

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one, but don't worry

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,380
Look, it's on fire

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,400
Ah, it's on fire

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,040
Ah, it's on fire

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
You'll be able to do something somehow

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,580
You know, right?

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, you know!

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know, then shut up and follow me!

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,840
Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-пис וandal

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:51,260
Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-пис wyandal

Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pys wandal

Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pys wandal

Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pys wandal

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pys wandal

Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pis wandal

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,900
Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pys wandal

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,980
Don't make a fool out of yourself, 2-pys wandal

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,480
I recommended you to the director, so please take care of him.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,220
Understood.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,960
And one more thing.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Can you ask a policeman who knows about the underground town to be a guide in the program?

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,680
That means you're going to be on TV?

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,180
Of course.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,700
If you say that there was a underground town born in a police station in front of the park...

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,800
Just one person.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,160
If there is a failure on the national net, it will be a nuisance to other officers.

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,920
It will be a nuisance to other officers.

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Let's avoid it somehow.

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
However, the temple is from Hokkaido, Reiko is from Kobe, and Nakagawa is from America.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Ohara, if you know the underground town, you can go anywhere you want.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,140
I see.

42
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,620
As expected of the director.

43
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,300
Are you going to write all this down in one night?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,920
It's a sudden story.

45
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,140
I'm sorry, but it's for the sake of the Katsushika office and this town.

46
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,420
Don't do it.

47
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,300
But if you're going to guide the underground town, you're more responsible than me.

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,000
I know that.

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,840
What?

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
I don't know what to do.

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,560
I asked Ryotsu to take a big risk of image down.

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,420
I'm going to hire a serious and beautiful young policeman.

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,800
I've thought about it with the director.

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,660
I see.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,460
What?

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,140
You're going to work in this station.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,960
A great underground police officer.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,300
That's right.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,220
I'm not going to let you do it.

60
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,800
Anyway, the director is a direct officer.

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,720
So, please get on a big ship and complete the mission.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,760
Does the senior know anything about this?

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,300
I don't know anything.

64
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,160
What?

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,260
I sold my first-hand and I made Ryotsu a minor from today.

66
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm sure he'll be playing somewhere by now.

67
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,260
Today's main, Kamiori Steaks.

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,420
The start has been cut.

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,540
Each is on the other side in a stale state.

70
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,460
The battle is hard.

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,300
What will I do next!

72
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,940
Now, turn to the 4th corner and go straight!

73
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,480
What's happening here?

74
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,960
They're lining up in front of the Ararako branch!

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,720
They're lining up!

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,360
They're lining up!

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,320
They're lining up!

78
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,480
Oh my!

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,260
It's a flash!

80
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,240
What?

81
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,740
What's happening here?

82
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,460
It flashed!

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,200
What happened?

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,560
The tissue fell!

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Hey!

86
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,960
This one fell too!

87
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,060
It looks like it's about to start.

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,280
Then, let's do the last one.

89
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,420
Yes.

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,100
What is this temple?

91
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,200
Daikyoji, also known as Shibamata Taishakuten.

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,920
What are its characteristics?

93
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,620
Well, its specialty is grass dumplings and hyakkaen.

94
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,520
Hyakkaen is Mukojima.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Eh?

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,460
Mukojima is Shobu-en.

97
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,420
Shobu-en is Horikiri.

98
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,200
I see.

99
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,320
Horikiri is Shobu-en, but it's Ohamajaya.

100
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,620
I haven't slept, so my head is getting confused.

101
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,040
Then, let's go to this one.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,940
Aotomatsushi's second son, Taizo-kun.

103
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,820
Correct.

104
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,260
Then, who is this?

105
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,860
Hmm...

106
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,960
Kenichi-kun from Shibamata's

107
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,680
Senbei shop.

108
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,500
This is Midori-chan from Kanamachi Tenkatsu.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
Kenichi-kun is this one.

110
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,620
Ah!

111
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,280
No!

112
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:21,780
No!

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,820
If it's Paria or Milano,

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm even familiar with the cafe's galson in the back street.

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
It's a one-night stand, so it's not impossible.

116
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
Well then, Nakagawa-san, please.

117
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,580
Ah!

118
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,380
Yes.

119
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,700
It's alright.

120
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,660
Be confident.

121
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,860
Well then, here we go.

122
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,060
5, 4, 3...

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Te... Teyandei!

124
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Bela-bomenei!

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Hmm...

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,340
I can't really feel anything.

127
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,000
Ah...

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,300
Ah!

129
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,360
It's Ocha-i, isn't it?

130
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,880
Then, please continue.

131
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,220
Go... Go... Gochisora!

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,760
Date ni Ishita-machi no hashitsuzo otome nan ga shishichainei tten da!

133
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,360
Konjikisho!

134
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,080
Hmm...

135
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,480
S... Sorry.

136
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,160
According to the story I heard from the Chief of the Katsushika branch,

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,540
Nakagawa-san was born in Fukagawa,

139
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,900
and his father is a "Tobi-shokunin" who has been a "Tobi-shokunin" for 10 generations.

140
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,700
His mother is a former geisha of Yanagi Bridge, Haru Yakko.

141
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,880
His older brother is a "Hanabi-shokunin", and his younger brother is a "Rakugo-ka".

142
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh!

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,980
Y... Yes!

144
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,740
I was really happy to hear that he was the perfect character for this program,

145
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,820
but he seems to be a very elite young man.

146
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,680
He's being ignored.

147
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,460
What should we do?

148
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,940
Hmm...

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,280
Actually...

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,180
The times have changed, I suppose.

151
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,180
Huh?

152
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,700
We'll have to make a little bit of a scene here, but that's fine, right?

153
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,320
Please help the two of them, too!

154
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,700
What?

155
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Us, too?

156
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,880
All right! Let's go!

157
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,060
Next Hour

158
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,120
I think they're like "Tola-san".

159
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,060
Not "like". That's how they are.

160
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,860
All right, all right, I'm getting where we need to go!

161
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,340
Mr. Nakagawa's short pants and his short valiant look мер.

162
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,280
Then after half a year, we'll have Mr. Nakagawa come back with "bu-rari!"

163
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,260
Please welcome the two old friends warmly.

164
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Well, that's just a great "Jun-sa" that I've never seen in half a year and I'd kill to regret it.

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,800
We're taking a walk around the town, so please walk around.

166
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,740
Please walk around.

167
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,740
We have no choice but to do as he said.

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
That's right.

169
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,900
There's a turtle there.

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,720
There must be a turtle.

171
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,620
Hey, worker, are you still an idiot?

172
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,140
Ryo-chan!

173
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,380
Hey, hey, there's a weekend job.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,640
Huh? A TV station?

175
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
No, I'm not going to go. I'm going to the camera. Peace!

176
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,140
Okay, okay, I'm good.

177
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,040
I was wrong, Nakagawa-san.

178
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,140
Um, I'm over here.

179
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,580
Oh? Then who are you?

180
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,580
Huh?

181
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,900
I see.

182
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,320
I was about to believe the manager's nonsense of taking a few days off.

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
Ryo-chan, didn't you go to the police station?

184
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,000
Even though it's a big day,

185
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,460
why did you go to the police station?

186
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,440
It was a light-hearted fuss.

187
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,240
I was expecting a young man from America

188
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,840
to be on TV.

189
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,320
I had a bad dream.

190
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,600
Huh?

191
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,960
Senior.

192
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,400
Turn around.

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,800
Yes.

194
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,520
I told the manager that you were more suitable for the job.

195
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
I told you that you were suitable for the job.

196
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,060
You can't ask Ryo-san, who doesn't know what to do,

197
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,640
to do an important job.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,560
What?

199
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,640
That's right.

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
If you are serious about your daily work,

201
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,540
I think the manager would have asked Ryo-chan to do it.

202
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,680
Don't treat people like a kid.

203
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,700
I can do it like a teacher.

204
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,940
Good.

205
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,060
Close.

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,460
Please do that line again with the name of the tongue.

207
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Name of the tongue?

208
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,060
Stop it, tongue!

209
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Don't treat people like a kid!

210
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,700
Like this.

211
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't talk like that now.

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Don't do that.

213
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,080
You are just like my father.

214
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
Hey, you.

215
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,520
You are making so much noise here.

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,180
I will teach you a lesson.

217
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,020
You are a good boy.

218
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,600
Okay.

219
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,180
Good.

220
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,340
I will wait for you.

221
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,100
I will ask you to be the guide.

222
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
You are a real man.

223
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,720
You are a real man.

224
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Leave it to me.

225
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,080
Oh.

226
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,920
You are like a tiger.

227
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,840
I think the manager likes you.

228
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,920
Ryo-san is back at the exit.

229
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,500
He is welcoming his colleague warmly.

230
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,980
Please say hi to him as usual.

231
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,400
It is hard to say hi as usual in this outfit.

232
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,420
Let's start.

233
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,900
You look a little thin.

234
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,640
Are you eating?

235
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
I am healthy.

236
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,740
I am healthy.

237
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,380
You are full of hair and cat's dandruff.

238
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,460
Ryo-san is back.

239
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,680
Ah.

240
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,400
You were dumped by a beautiful woman.

241
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,060
No.

242
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,660
That's why I am in a good mood.

243
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
He is a real man.

244
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,160
What?

245
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,560
Cut.

246
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay.

247
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,040
Great.

248
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,340
Now, Ryo-san who had a big fight with OI-chan,

249
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,260
will jump out of the building.

250
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,160
Who is OI-chan?

251
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,120
Ryo-san.

252
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,840
What are you doing here?

253
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,540
You have a day off until tomorrow.

254
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,800
You have been talking to me,

255
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
Even though you are a Katsushika-Hiroshi,

256
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,980
if you lead me to a low-ranging town,

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
there should be no one on my right.

258
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,320
This is the president's decision.

259
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,820
You have no right to say anything.

260
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,540
I will tell you.

261
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
I will tell you.

262
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,960
I am OK.

263
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,940
Great.

264
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,120
Great.

265
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,940
Next,

266
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,340
Ryo-san who jumped out of the building,

267
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,340
will tell the old lady who appeared suddenly.

268
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,560
If I tell you,

269
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,040
the old lady will be...

270
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,720
Hey,

271
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,460
Don't forget to appear on TV on behalf of the Katsushika-Hiroshi.

272
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,400
It's a joke.

273
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,640
It's a joke.

274
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,720
In that case,

275
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
you don't have to do anything.

276
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,660
I will be in all the shooting.

277
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,240
OK?

278
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,100
The president wants to be on TV.

279
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,940
What?

280
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,180
What?

281
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,820
It's OK, chief.

282
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,140
Let's do it for the image of the Katsushika-Hiroshi.

283
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,800
Well,

284
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,160
which is Mr. Komine's house?

285
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,140
Well,

286
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,720
go straight and turn left.

287
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,140
OK.

288
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,460
Then,

289
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,760
I'll wear it and go to Edoben again.

290
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,720
What?

291
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,660
Go straight and turn left.

292
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,680
That's where you are.

293
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,600
Thank you very much.

294
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,240
This is a way of talking.

295
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,460
Really.

296
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,880
What?

297
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,020
Yes.

298
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,720
Next,

299
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,820
please tell us about the environment around this exhaust pipe.

300
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,620
Well,

301
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,820
this is the 6th line of the national highway,

302
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,860
which flows in front of this exhaust pipe.

303
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,940
From the place where you go to the Mito area,

304
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,320
which is familiar to you in the Mito Komen,

305
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,480
the name of the Mito Kaido has been given.

306
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,600
Although the real Mito Kaido is a narrow road in the back,

307
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,040
this 6th line is a new road.

308
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,660
In the past,

309
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,680
it was called the 13th road.

310
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,480
Why is it called the 13th road?

311
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,020
The road is just like the Mito Kaido.

312
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,820
The road width is just right.

313
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,540
13th.

314
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,640
This is a famous 13th-line road.

315
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,200
It's a strange story.

316
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,900
I hope you understand.

317
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,580
OK.

318
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,600
Thank you.

319
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,800
Don't you think that you really look like a police officer in the city of Shita?

320
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
Mr. Chief.

321
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,220
Oh,

322
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
I wonder.

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,120
Oh,

324
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,880
I was also amazed at the place where you just shot Mr. Ryotsu.

325
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,080
Oh,

326
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,900
you were shooting?

327
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes.

328
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,880
I was in a bad mood in the city of Shita.

329
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,980
Oh,

330
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,780
I see.

331
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,860
You're doing your best.

332
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,580
The feeling of loving the city of Shita is one in a million.

333
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,980
Yes,

334
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,620
it's okay for this.

335
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,740
That's good.

336
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,420
I feel like I'm making a mistake.

337
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,760
I can be on TV.

338
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,040
Well,

339
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,500
that's fine.

340
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,020
I'll let you off the earth.

341
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,640
bye.

342
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,700
Hey,

343
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,900
Let's go now.

344
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,220
Kuroyama.

345
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,720
Kuroyama.

346
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,620
Kuroyama.

347
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,080
Well,

348
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,360
you're right.

349
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,160
You'll do everything well.

350
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,480
Thank you.

351
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,880
That's fine.

352
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,840
You can go now.

353
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,420
Thank you for telling me no.

354
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,820
Thank you so much.

355
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,580
I truly appreciate it.

356
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,180
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,800
Kuroyama,

358
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:06,880
I respect you.

359
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,500
This is a show-off, Ryotsu-san.

360
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,540
He's carrying Mikoshi and is a man.

361
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,160
He's patrolling from Inase to Shibamata.

362
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,460
Shibamata!? How many kilometers do you think it's going to take?

363
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,300
It's 3 km by straight line.

364
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,020
Are you trying to kill me?

365
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,020
Boss, at least help me carry him.

366
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,700
I can't.

367
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Gikkuri-koshi was not healed the other day.

368
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Show me your spirit.

369
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,140
I can't.

370
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,800
Damn it. I'll show you my spirit.

371
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,440
O-ryaah!

372
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,620
Wa-shoi! Wa-shoi! Wa-shoi! Wa-shoi! Wa-shoi! Wa-shoi!

373
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,760
Here, here, here, here...

374
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,640
I'm so hungry I can't walk.

375
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,880
What's that?

376
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,080
What's wrong, Ryotsu-san?

377
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,040
Ah...

378
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,380
Let's make a scene where I ask the chief of the town to feed me eel.

379
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:14,920
What?

380
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,900
Oh, so you were born in the town, too, chief.

381
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,160
Well, um...

382
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,460
I was born anyway.

383
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,620
I'm living in Chiba now.

384
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:25,960
Okay.

385
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,940
Let's make a scene where we eat together.

386
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,300
Please take the sign of the restaurant.

387
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,080
Hehehehe.

388
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,880
Have you ordered anything?

389
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,060
What do you want to order?

390
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,040
Well, I'll have the eel bowl.

391
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,860
What?

392
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,180
The staff will treat you to a special eel bowl with liver soup?

393
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,560
Oh?

394
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,100
I see.

395
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm the cheapest one.

396
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,180
I see.

397
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,400
So this is the spirit of the town.

398
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,460
Yes.

399
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't afford the money I have to pay for the meal.

400
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,060
I see.

401
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,520
I see.

402
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,620
I'll have the extra sake and the cold beer.

403
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,480
Okay.

404
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,700
A special meal for 15 people.

405
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,540
Liver soup.

406
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,760
And cold beer.

407
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,800
Oh.

408
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,600
Ahahahaha.

409
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,460
It's always so lively here.

410
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,720
Thanks to you, I won't have to pay for the meal until the end of the month.

411
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,100
It's better than living alone.

412
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,940
I don't know why.

413
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,100
Huh?

414
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,600
What?

415
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,540
When I think back on what we've done so far,

416
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,360
I wonder if we can really make a PR program with that kind of scene.

417
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,960
Huh?

418
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,740
There's no way we can.

419
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,820
I thought it was strange from the beginning.

420
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,380
Oh, I see.

421
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,840
If we keep this up, we'll be laughed at all over the Internet, not just us.

422
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,220
Chief.

423
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,760
That's a problem.

424
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,420
I'm hoping that this show will be a PR program, too.

425
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,820
I can't even look at my parents and my ancestors.

426
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,420
Ah.

427
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,720
Ah.

428
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,260
Oh.

429
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,940
It's Koto!

430
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,420
Get lost!

431
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,880
Get lost!

432
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,700
You idiot!

433
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,700
You're not going to get away with this.

434
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,260
Huh?

435
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,020
Chief.

436
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,980
Stop it!

437
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,780
Let him go!

438
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,800
Shut up!

439
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,660
Get lost!

440
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,480
Get lost!

441
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,300
It's Kota!

442
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:25,840
Ah!

443
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:26,960
Oh!

444
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,040
Chief!

445
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,440
Turn around behind him and stab him.

446
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,640
Roger that.

447
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,440
Ouch!

448
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,000
Let him go!

449
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,060
Shut up!

450
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,100
Get lost!

451
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,860
Get lost!

452
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,920
Get lost!

453
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,860
Get lost!

454
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,260
Get lost!

455
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,760
What's going on?

456
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,140
Damn it!

457
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,840
Any injuries?

458
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,300
No.

459
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,240
Get lost!

460
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,580
Stop!

461
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,640
Stop!

462
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm sorry!

463
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,640
I'm so sorry!

464
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,500
I'm so sorry!

465
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,540
Easy.

466
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,020
Easy.

467
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,500
Easy.

468
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,460
Easy.

469
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,240
Easy.

470
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,600
Easy.

471
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:10,840
Easy.

472
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,980
Easy.

473
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,960
Easy.

474
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:11,980
Easy.

475
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,600
Easy.

476
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:12,800
Easy.

477
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,320
Easy.

478
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:16,740
Easy.

479
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:16,840
Easy.

480
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,140
Easy.

481
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,200
Easy.

482
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,720
Easy.

483
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,120
"Matsuo! Matsuo!"

484
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,360
"Wait!"

485
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,140
"What the hell is this guy doing at this critical moment?"

486
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,340
"Mucho!"

487
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
"We've been waiting for you, Mucho!"

488
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,300
"What's with that camera?"

489
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,440
"I just thought of a great idea!"

490
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,160
"A great idea?"

491
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,940
"I'm going to make a show with it!"

492
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,160
"Then the program's structure should be replaced!"

493
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,760
"Anyway, go after the culprit! I'm fine with it!"

494
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,720
"Roger!"

495
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,460
"Wait!"

496
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,040
"Don't you hear me say 'wait for me'?"

497
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,300
"What the hell are you doing?"

498
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,320
"Shut up! Stop right there!"

499
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,680
"You hear me?"

500
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,260
"Don't run away!"

501
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
"I'll kill you!"

502
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,740
"The 800-year-old Edo village's hidden " "G

also a cherry blossom!"

505
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,740
"It's a young man called Hanakawa Sukeroku"

506
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,500
"or a young man called Ryotsu"

507
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,220
"from the Kameyari Park."

508
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,720
"Don't run away!"

509
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,980
"You're going to pay for it!"

510
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,800
"You're all going to pay for it!"

511
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,620
"What the hell?"

512
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,280
"You don't know what's going on, Sukeroku!"

513
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,940
"Give me back what you stole!"

514
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,120
"You're still resisting?"

515
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,260
"You little..."

516
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,960
"Oh?"

517
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,700
"Darn you!"

518
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,260
"You're full of yourself!"

519
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,640
"You've made a fool of me!"

520
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,420
"You turned me into a fool!"

521
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
"Ryotsu!"

522
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,660
"Ryotsu!"

523
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,220
"Don't come near me!"

524
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,020
"I know!"

525
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,480
"Let go! Let me go!"

526
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,540
"I won't let you get away!"

527
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,840
"What the hell?"

528
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,380
What's wrong, Ryosu?! I'm coming!

529
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:26,460
Let's go!

530
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,080
Hey, hold on!

531
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,040
Did you get it?

532
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,960
I'll use this!

533
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,660
Thank you for your hard work.

534
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
Here you go.

535
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,660
S-Sorry.

536
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,340
Mr. Ryosu, Mr. Ohara. I've been waiting for you for five times.

537
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,080
You understood, didn't you?

538
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,760
Look! This is the spirit of a police officer.

539
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,160
Yes, I finally understood.

540
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,440
I can make a wonderful show with this!

541
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,380
Thank you very much.

542
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,040
Ah, thank you very much for your help.

543
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,180
It seems I was able to keep my eyes on you.

544
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,500
This is good.

545
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,260
I'll have to excuse myself for this, again.

546
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,180
Shura Saito

547
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,820
Mr. Ryo, this is the place where we can put the secret of the secret.

548
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,440
Yes, Chief.

549
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,280
Here I go.

550
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,240
Close your eyes and we will wait for you!

551
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,880
Oh, thank you very much, I just want you to leave me alone.

552
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:12,120
I will record the scene in the latest DVD and tell my story to you.

553
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,480
I'll do it.

554
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,100
Ryo, congratulations.

555
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,020
The robbery was also arrested.

556
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,020
I thought what would happen when I went out with the chief.

557
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,180
That's good.

558
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,900
This is a champagne for celebration.

559
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,180
You don't have to be so careful.

560
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,220
One is 300,000 yen.

561
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,420
I'll sell it to the owner.

562
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,540
Ryo, the president is giving compliments.

563
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,860
I'm embarrassed.

564
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,740
This is the problem with the boss.

565
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,020
This is the problem with the boss.

566
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,380
Thank you for your hard work.

567
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,980
You did well, Ryo.

568
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,240
It's all thanks to the chief.

569
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,960
Well.

570
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,340
The director also understood what happened at the end.

571
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,100
It's a perfect program for PR and image up of my office.

572
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,060
I'm looking forward to it.

573
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,200
I'll show you the front row.

574
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,260
It's about to start.

575
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,340
A recover your spirit.

576
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,060
What's this?

577
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,380
It's not firewood.

578
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,040
This is a firewood.

579
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:26,880
This is the firewood.

580
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,080
It's your favorite firewood.

581
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,600
Let's do it.

582
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,420
The direction in which the firewood converges.

583
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,020
He's really here!

584
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

585
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,900
I'll send you a lot of "Shitamachi Jocho"

586
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,180
60 minutes!

587
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,480
80 minutes!

588
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm sorry again

589
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,340
What is this?

590
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,840
That's...

591
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,500
Hey! Ryo-kun!

592
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,760
It's not my fault

593
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,660
The director doesn't understand!

594
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,400
It's an ounces please

595
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,180
Please, can't you too?

596
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:45,200
I'll send you a lot of "Shitamachi Jocho"

597
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,280
Ryo-kun?

598
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,380
I hear someone at the last minute

599
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,600
Someone's watching

600
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,100
Ryo-kun?

601
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,740
That's not it

602
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,680
And the blue lady above my eyes

603
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,520
Turn around and see

604
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,900
That corner

605
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,680
I can see you all

606
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,620
Let's go!

607
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,240
That's Kameari

608
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,120
Kameari for sure

609
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,620
Come on, everyone

610
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,340
To our town

611
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:24,420
To our town

612
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

613
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,180
You were listening to the story

614
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,440
of the worst man, Ryotsu Kankichi, right?

615
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,340
I see. Your face and way of talking are also vulgar.

616
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,500
Me?

617
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,840
I'm Ghiboshi Lemon, the younger sister of Matoi.

618
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,960
Next time on Super Kindergarten, Lemon!

619
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,980
Thanks for watching!

620
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:02,260
