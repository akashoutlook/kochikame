2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,360
I look at the sun that floats in the river

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,260
If I kick a love stone, it'll fly to my shoes

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,560
I wonder if I'll go to the taiku school

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,940
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,560
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,980
There are only patsushika and Kameari

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,260
Even if I have a bad breath, it doesn't change

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape is strangely gentle

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,400
From the waterway of Tongari-boshi

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
I go to Kaishakuten

12
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,120
The sunset falls

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,420
Tomorrow, it's already over

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,480
I lost my happiness again

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,880
Because of the patsushika and Kameari

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,860
I realized

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,220
I'm an idiot

18
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,240
I'm a fool

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,060
That's why

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,340
I'm not an idiot

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,980
I'm an idiot

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,980
The

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,080
No, it doesn't work.

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,140
Did you say what?

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
What?

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,840
Didn't you say what?

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,080
Don't do it again, are you a snake?

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,760
That's why accidents don't happen!

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,940
I couldn't feel the accelerator because of my body.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,700
Whether it's a new car, an old car, a dump car, or an F1 car,

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,540
speed over is speed over.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Then...

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,080
Is a bicycle okay?

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,920
What?

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,740
B-B-B-B-Boom!

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,380
Uwaan!

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,260
You got it!

38
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,100
Ryochi Kan-kichi!

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,980
Oh, yes.

40
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,840
I've got to go to the bus station.

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,980
Why do you need to go to my place?

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,660
Shin-shin!

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
I want to go to your place.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
I don't want to go either.

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,480
I was ordered by our director Ohara to be...

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,700
following the traffic safety rules.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,460
Barber safety-

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,040
So, the transportation department...

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
How do I read it?

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,860
Ishiatama Tetsui?

51
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,280
Ishizu Tetsuo!

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,540
Yes, Ishizu!

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,120
He has to take private instruction.

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
What kind of...

55
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,200
What's wrong?

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,760
I just want to ask about the director.

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,080
You're going to ask about the director?

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,020
Yes.

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,820
You were at the director's...

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,020
He was a nasty guy like a cockroach.

61
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,320
Poor thing.

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,800
What's with that reaction?

63
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,920
I don't know.

64
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,560
I might never see him again.

65
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,940
Goodbye.

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
Hey, wait!

67
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,440
I don't get it.

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
What's going on?

69
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,060
What kind of old man is he?

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
No way.

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,260
He is going to the director?

72
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,400
No way.

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
So what's with that reaction?

74
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
I, Maria...

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm never going to forget about you.

76
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,320
Hey!

77
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,380
Goodbye!

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,980
What's going on?

79
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,880
The next morning

80
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,620
I came to see you, Director Ishizu.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,100
What can I do for you, Director Ishizu?

82
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm here to get a traffic safety instruction.

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,260
A traffic safety instruction?

84
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,820
Where am I? Who am I?

85
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,080
Again?

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Hey, what kind of person is Director Ishizu?

87
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,980
What kind of person is he?

88
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,340
Tell me what kind of person he is!

89
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,820
Is he that scary?

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,980
Sorry, can you pass me there?

91
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm trying to get in.

92
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,740
Director Ishizu...

93
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,120
What?

94
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,600
Excuse me.

95
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,500
What? You look like a nice old man.

97
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,480
Come here.

98
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,900
Director Ishizu?

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,180
Yes, Director Ishizu.

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,820
I came to see Detective Ryotsu

101
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,520
at the acid mine outside Kamiwari-koen.

102
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,900
Oh, well.

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,980
It's really a difficult job.

104
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,960
You're going to the arcade, too?

105
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,820
I'm a very passionate racer.

106
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm glad I'm starting to understand you.

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,380
Let's carry out this aritincality

108
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,920
together in the arcade.

109
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,120
Let's get a traffic safety teaching!

110
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,700
I thought I'd do it on purpose.

111
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,020
Traffic safety instruction?

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,320
I'll get it ready.

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,160
Are you going to change?

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
For the market?

115
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,160
What's going on?

116
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,680
What's that?

117
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,560
The time has come.

118
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,340
Human beings are facing a crisis of extinction.

119
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,680
In the battle of the traffic war...

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,060
But!

121
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,680
A savior has appeared!

122
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,680
What?

123
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,340
What are you?

124
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
35 years of running traffic.

125
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,440
Traffic safety instruction master class 7.

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,740
Ishizu Tetsuo Kenzan!

127
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,640
Is he the chief of Ishizu?

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Yes.

129
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,860
He's like a different person.

130
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,260
You just said something that was not related to traffic safety instruction.

131
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,240
I was just talking.

132
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,120
You're the police officer who leads the citizens.

133
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,500
I won't forgive you!

134
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Yankip's Yankip!

135
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,380
This is annoying!

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,300
I'll let you go!

137
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,620
Driver, stop the car!

138
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,220
Let go of me!

139
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,940
Don't let go of me suddenly!

140
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,260
I'll give you a lot of traffic safety instruction.

141
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
Be prepared!

142
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,560
Why do I have to dress like this?

143
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,980
That's the uniform of traffic safety instructor class 7.

144
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,960
Traffic safety instructor class 7?

145
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,340
What's that?

146
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,540
I decided to spread the correct traffic safety to the whole country.

147
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,840
By the way, the armor is allowed to the first class.

148
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,220
The traffic light and the siren can only be allowed to those who are allowed to the first class.

149
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,840
The siren is a sign of the first class.

150
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,900
Shut up! I can't hear anything!

151
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,700
You're a beginner, so first class 7!

152
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,960
Every time you master the traffic law, you are promoted to class 6 and 5.

153
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,500
No one has ever been promoted to class 6.

154
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,840
Ishizu-style traffic safety instruction.

155
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,600
First, the way to cross the pedestrian crossing.

156
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,560
Do it.

157
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,600
There's no car on the pedestrian crossing.

158
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
You just have to cross it quickly.

159
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,960
No!

160
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,880
What?

161
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,980
What are you doing?

162
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,600
I should have learned this in elementary school.

163
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,980
When you cross the pedestrian crossing,

164
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,220
look right, look left, look right again, raise your hand and cross.

165
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Do it again!

166
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,420
I got it.

167
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,540
Look right, look left, look right again, raise your hand and cross.

168
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,360
Look left, look right again, raise your hand and cross.

169
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,960
This is fine, right?

170
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,240
You're so naive!

171
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,160
I did it as you told me to do!

172
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,980
Do you think you're really prepared for safety?

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,280
And when there's a flag, put it out properly!

174
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,320
Where's the flag?

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,660
Huh?

176
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,100
It was a flag, wasn't it?

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,920
You have to be prepared to check whether you're really safe or not.

178
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,540
I'll show you a sample.

179
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,500
Look closely!

180
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,820
How to cross the right pedestrian crossing.

181
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,000
Confirm the signal.

182
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,240
All green, clear.

183
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,840
Confirm right.

184
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,580
No driver.

185
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,760
Confirm left.

186
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,000
No driver.

187
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,940
No driver.

188
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,000
No driver.

189
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,980
Confirm safety.

190
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,280
All clear.

191
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,100
Left hand!

192
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,580
No german flag.

193
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,260
No german flag.

194
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,520
No german flag.

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,280
No german flag.

196
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,200
The angle of the right hand is 75 degrees.

197
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,060
It is a good angle for the driver in the back.

198
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,520
The light is painted with fluorescent paint on the iron frame, so it looks bright at night.

199
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,520
It's been 35 years since the car was called a "driving car".

200
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,620
This is the way to cross the right crosswalk in the first grade!

201
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,880
I can't believe I'm doing this much just to cross the crosswalk.

202
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,040
I can't believe I'm doing this much just to cross the crosswalk.

203
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,420
You are not serious enough.

204
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,860
It seems better to actually go out into the city and teach.

205
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,540
This is my favorite car!

206
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,560
What is this?

207
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,540
A large back mirror that can better confirm your safety.

208
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,280
A special winch that is designed so that the opponent does not look down on you.

209
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,160
A support ring to prevent headlamps.

210
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,340
There are also various other ways to prevent headlamps.

211
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,900
This is the 98 version.

212
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
The final version of the safety measures.

213
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
It is the Ishi-Zu-ryu Hyper Shirobai.

214
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,360
It's a ugly bike for its name.

215
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,420
Idiot!

216
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,240
It is safer than you think.

217
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,320
Looking at the history of the 20th century, there are too many accidents that were caused by the safety of the driver.

218
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,360
It's a period of traffic accidents.

219
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah.

220
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,600
The 21st century is a period of traffic safety.

221
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,280
As the first step, I spent my money to modify this bike.

222
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,900
Of course, I tried to modify other bikes, but why do you all hate it?

223
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,900
I'm a policeman, but I'm too low on traffic safety.

224
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,020
This Shirobai is too heavy and dangerous.

225
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,360
Do you have a license for a single-seater?

226
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,280
I have it for the time being.

227
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,540
I'll tell you how to ride a single-seater like Ishi-Zu.

228
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,500
Try it.

229
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,800
Yes, yes.

230
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
How is it?

231
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,220
Idiot!

232
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,640
If you ride a single-seater, you can put on a seat belt right away.

233
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,580
I've never heard of a bike with a seat belt.

234
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,660
It's on my single-seater.

235
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,960
What?

236
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,860
It's true.

237
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:07,980
It's true.

238
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,500
Is this all right?

239
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,140
That's not all about seat belts.

240
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:13,900
What?

241
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,740
There are double seat belts?

242
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,900
As expected of a bike in the 7th generation of the road safety and driving market.

243
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,740
That's not all.

244
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,300
Is there more?

245
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,820
There's more here.

246
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,140
More here.

247
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,560
More here.

248
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,360
More here.

249
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,540
More here.

250
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,120
More here.

251
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,480
This is the ultimate safety.

252
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,680
It's a 36-point seat belt.

253
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,140
This can withstand shocks from all directions.

254
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,540
But I can't move at all.

255
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,860
So, next, try to hold the steering wheel.

256
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,220
I'll show you how I actually drive.

257
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,640
How is it?

258
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,760
Wrong!

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,520
Ouch!

260
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,380
What do you mean, wrong?

261
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,280
Listen.

262
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,020
First, your back is 90 degrees.

263
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,920
Your neck is 78 degrees.

264
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,820
Your arms are 65 degrees.

265
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,420
Your feet are 115 degrees.

266
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,220
Your knees are 62 degrees.

267
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,780
This is the correct way of riding a tank.

268
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm going crazy thinking that it's a human body.

269
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,320
What?

270
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,780
This speedometer is only up to 60 km/h.

271
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,720
Of course.

272
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,960
The maximum speed of the Japanese roads is 60 km/h.

273
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,980
You don't need any more than that.

274
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,580
That's for the public roads, right?

275
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,600
What about the highway?

276
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,620
The highway?

277
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,260
It's made to protect the speed you set,

278
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,080
and to protect your life.

279
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,580
It's made to be able to speed up on purpose.

280
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,840
What is the government thinking?

281
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,820
There's such a thing, so it's not going to reduce the number of accidents.

282
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,760
I'm going to ride with you.

283
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm not going to use the highway.

284
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
You're a very aggressive person.

285
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,520
Now, let's get out of town.

286
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,240
Where's my bike?

287
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,020
You idiot!

288
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,480
In Ishizu-style traffic safety guidance,

289
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,760
you can ride a single car from the third floor.

290
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,480
Then what should I do?

291
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,480
People in the seventh grade should run.

292
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,620
What?

293
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,680
Wait, Chief Ihitsu, what?

294
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,760
What?

295
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,420
Hurry up and follow me.

296
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,040
It's dangerous, so let me go.

297
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,540
This is not a joke.

298
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,680
No!

299
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,780
It's annoying.

300
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,420
What? Did you wait for me?

301
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,600
In front of the seven-stage Ishizu-style traffic safety guidance,

302
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,600
You are now forgiven.

303
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,240
There are some discriminatory tickets here.

304
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,540
People wearing red tickets.

305
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,180
You do what I do!

306
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,720
It's a traffic light bug.

307
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,080
Yeah, but in myule, when I passed, I was blue.

308
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,200
You look like , don't you?

309
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,600
Why didn't you see with a rear view mirror?

310
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,420
I passed before I turned red!

311
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,060
You fool, don't you know what i mean?

312
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,320
Hmm, you'll turn red soon, won't you?

313
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,920
No, it's not!

314
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,000
Come on!

315
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,980
First, when you are already in the

316
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,560
crossroads,

317
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,080
if the signal goes off,

318
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,660
you must cross it quickly!

319
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,540
Oh, dear...

320
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,280
Isn't the armor too heavy?

321
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
This is something

322
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,580
that will protect me.

323
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,380
I can't let go of it.

324
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,420
Do it yourself.

325
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,680
Let me go.

326
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,100
And before you enter the crossroads,

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,020
you must stop.

328
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,320
Shut up!

329
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,400
Chief Ishizu!

330
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,620
Damn it!

331
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,580
There are people like you,

332
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,120
so the traffic laws in Japan

333
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,500
are going to be messed up!

334
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,840
Please stop! It's red!

335
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,740
Are you okay?

336
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,820
Oh, thanks to the armor,

337
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm not hurt at all!

338
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,900
This is Ishizu-ryu!

339
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,260
You wouldn't have fallen

340
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,140
without the armor, would you?

341
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,520
This time,

342
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,220
I'll cross the crossroads.

343
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,080
Try it!

344
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,360
It's basically the same as the crossroads.

345
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,400
Give me your binoculars!

346
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,500
No, you can't!

347
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,440
You can use your binoculars

348
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,880
from level 1!

349
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,420
I'll check it with my naked eye.

350
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,640
It's pretty detailed.

351
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,800
Right!

352
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,380
Left!

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,860
Right again!

354
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,020
I'll cross it!

355
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,380
Wait!

356
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,620
Ouch!

357
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,360
Ouch!

358
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,460
I'm sure you've checked it!

359
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,980
In the case of a crossroads,

360
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
you need more procedure.

361
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
The train is much faster

362
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,660
than a car.

363
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,500
It comes in no time.

364
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,460
Huh?

365
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,880
I'll listen to the train

366
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,220
and check.

367
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,200
This is the Ishizu-ryu

368
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,780
crossroads!

369
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,280
Do we really need to go that far?

370
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,500
Huh?

371
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,720
Hey! Get out of the way!

372
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm in the middle of

373
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,520
a traffic safety operation!

374
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,320
Wait for me!

375
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,400
We're in a hurry!

376
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,380
What?

377
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,160
Drivers like you

378
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,960
mess up the traffic laws!

379
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,140
If you're in a hurry,

380
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,620
you'll be a driver!

381
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,280
You're a driver,

382
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,360
you're in a hurry!

383
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,000
Did you get it?

384
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,140
What?

385
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,120
How can a modern man

386
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,700
be in a hurry?

387
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,820
The Ishizu-ryu

388
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,920
traffic safety guidance

389
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,300
is available to everyone!

390
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,100
Hey!

391
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,780
Are you okay?

392
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,980
Thanks to your armor,

393
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,820
I was saved.

394
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,700
I guess I didn't notice

395
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,920
the warning because of the armor.

396
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,180
Hey!

397
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,480
You're in a hurry!

398
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,600
Drive safely!

399
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,160
You are a good driver!

400
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,160
What?

401
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,380
What did you say?

402
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,840
I was in a hurry!

403
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,400
Hey!

404
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,460
You're a good driver!

405
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,740
I was in a hurry!

406
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,300
I was in a hurry!

407
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,580
I was in a hurry!

408
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,920
You're in a hurry!

409
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,060
You're in a hurry!

410
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,540
What's wrong?

411
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm in a hurry!

412
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,620
Don't give up!

413
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,460
You're in a hurry!

414
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,580
What?

415
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:03,920
You're in a hurry!

416
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
You're in a hurry!

417
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,520
I don't think that's the time to be talking about that.

418
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,420
I'll protect the traffic law at any time.

419
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,100
This is the Ishizu style.

420
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,000
Uwaa, Matsuri!

421
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,180
I told you to wait!

422
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,800
You lost sight of me, didn't you?

423
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,640
Don't worry.

424
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,540
I'm using radar.

425
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,340
Huh? Radar?

426
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm detecting the weak radiation of the self-made paint of this armor when I jump.

427
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,780
You're a lot of junk.

428
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,480
But you're using all the high-tech methods wrong.

429
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,500
Huh?

430
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,260
Ah, it's moving away!

431
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,080
Please speed up!

432
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,780
This road is 30 km/h.

433
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm making sirens ring.

434
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,520
This is a good time.

435
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,420
Whatever you say, the speed limit is reduced.

436
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,520
That's the Ishizu style.

437
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,780
Don't talk.

438
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,340
What are you doing?

439
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,240
Speed up!

440
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,480
Stop!

441
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,920
Uwaa!

442
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:57,980
Uwaa!

443
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,380
Idiot! Stop! Stop!

444
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,440
I won't stop!

445
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,380
Stop! Stop!

446
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,100
Uwaa!

447
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
Uwaa!

448
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,820
Uwaa!

449
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,020
Uwaa!

450
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,340
What's going on?

451
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,760
I've never seen such a good track record.

452
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,160
I've never seen such a good track record.

453
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,260
I've never seen such a good track record.

454
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,760
Uwaa!

455
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:37,260
Uwaa!

456
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,200
Uwaa!

457
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,300
Uwaa!

458
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,400
Uwaa!

459
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,800
Stop!

460
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,980
Stop!

461
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,760
Uwaa!

462
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,920
Uwaa!

463
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,900
Uwaa!

464
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:57,980
Ahhhh!

465
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,700
Damn, damn!

466
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,300
Ah!

467
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,500
Light, light!

468
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,700
This guy's got a bad sense of direction!

469
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,740
It's close, it's close!

470
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,720
There!

471
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,740
Stop that car!

472
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,360
Oh, no! It's a white rider!

473
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,400
Ah!

474
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,360
Don't worry!

475
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,140
Don't worry about it!

476
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,960
Fire the smoke bomb!

477
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,580
I can't see anything!

478
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,580
I can see everything!

479
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,780
Ishizuri's Car-Stopping Jutsu!

480
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,400
Ouch!

481
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,260
Fire the smoke bomb!

482
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,260
Who are you?

483
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Did you see that?

484
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,680
This is Ishizuri's Car-Stopping Jutsu!

485
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,480
Gah!

486
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,920
Hm? What's wrong?

487
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,220
What have I done so far?

488
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,260
What?

489
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,620
You did it again...

490
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,660
You still don't remember?

491
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,400
When I exceed the speed limit, I can't stop the car-stopping jutsu because I hate car-stopping.

492
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,860
You're the cause of the accident.

493
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,760
This is because...

494
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,420
...everything...

495
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,080
...is caused by the traffic law!

496
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,300
What?

497
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,780
This traffic safety instructor, Tetsuo Ishizu...

498
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,580
...will definitely...

499
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,420
...make Ishizuri's traffic safety a priority for the entire nation!

500
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,080
So that I won't be able to run wild!

501
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,220
Ah, this is amazing!

502
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,660
Ryo-chan, it looks like you had a hard day yesterday.

503
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,920
Well, the traffic safety instructor is already tired.

504
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,580
Sorry!

505
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,060
Chief Ishizu!

506
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:12,860
Huh?

507
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,100
What about this guy?

508
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,920
What's the matter, Chief Ishizu?

509
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,300
The traffic safety instructor is already done, right?

510
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,280
Good job on your work yesterday.

511
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,580
So I decided to make you...

512
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,860
...the one who will make Ishizuri's traffic safety instructor...

513
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,020
...from level 7 to level 6.

514
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,140
Ryo-chan, you're amazing!

515
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm glad to hear that, Senpai.

516
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,420
No, I'm fine...

517
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,800
What?!

518
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,900
Don't hold back!

519
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,220
Ah, I get it!

520
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,060
From level 6, you can drive a tricycle.

521
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,320
Then follow me!

522
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm a patrol!

523
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
This is better than running!

524
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,720
Hey, wait!

525
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,700
Don't go first!

526
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,900
Damn it!

527
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,600
I didn't want to rush!

528
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,160
Popopo!

529
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,980
It's not the time to sing "Hatopopo!"

530
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,100
Why can't I become a special detective...

531
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,140
...or a "Hatopopo" detective?!

532
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,180
Why can't I become a special detective...

533
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,560
...or a "Hatopopo" detective?

534
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:14,840
I'm a special detective!

535
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,040
Please do something without me...

536
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,140
...and steal my rifle!

537
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,000
Head-sign: I'm a special detective!

538
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,500
Head-sign: You've just killed the police!

539
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:32,420
Head-sign: You're just a little pirate...

540
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,200
...and you stole our boat!

541
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
Head-sign: You were a special detective!

542
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,580
Head-sign: You can't go that way!

543
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,660
Head-sign: Now do a good job!

544
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,060
Wow!

545
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,860
I'm so happy!

546
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,480
Beep!

547
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,260
I'm so excited!

548
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:48,860
Bingo!

549
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,580
I'm so excited!

550
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,060
Booyah!

551
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm so excited!

552
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,800
Beep! Beep!

553
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm so excited!

554
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm so excited!

555
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,340
Beep! Beep!

556
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm so excited!

557
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,260
Beep! Beep!

558
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,100
Beep! Beep!

559
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,660
Beep! Beep!

560
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:56,680
Beep! Beep!

561
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:56,760
