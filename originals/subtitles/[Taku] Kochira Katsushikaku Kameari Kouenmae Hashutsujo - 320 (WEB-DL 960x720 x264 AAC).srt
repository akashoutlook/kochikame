At this time,

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,960
the seat of the flower is not yet prepared.

20
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,520
What do you mean?

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,500
No matter what you say,

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,260
the flower is still far away.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,580
You don't have to take a seat so early.

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,360
Too sweet!

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,160
Too sweet!

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,320
Flower viewing is a big event in spring.

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,080
The place of the flower viewing is

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,580
a garbage dump,

29
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,880
near the toilet,

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,300
or the street of people.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,980
The place of the flower viewing is a very noisy place.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,980
If there is a strange shop near,

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,760
the participants will not be able to enjoy the flower viewing,

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,460
and the scars of the heart will remain for a lifetime.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,780
It's too much.

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
It's not too much.

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,840
There are only a few special seats that can enjoy the flower viewing.

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,160
By the way, in the case of the upper park,

39
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,980
the area of the special seats of the flower viewing is one tennis court.

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,620
Is that all?

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,500
Yes.

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,420
That's why,

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,340
if you don't take a seat now,

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,300
what will happen?

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,880
I understand.

46
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,260
I'll leave this case to you, Ryo-tsu.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,520
That's why.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,300
I want you to take a seat immediately.

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
What about work?

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,760
Of course, you will be assigned.

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't have time to play.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,300
It's the same as night shift.

53
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,620
Don't answer.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
This is an order.

55
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,760
I've done it when I was a student,

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,280
but it's enough the day before.

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,560
That's right.

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,680
That's too early.

59
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,940
Well,

60
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,220
I'll try if you say so.

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,460
Try?

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,700
There are three super special seats in the upper park,

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,660
which should be called special seats in the special seats.

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,260
If you can secure it by the afternoon of tomorrow,

65
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
I will accept your request.

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,960
That's true.

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,100
In return,

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
if you can't do it,

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
please follow my instructions.

70
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,540
Good!

71
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,240
One seat up.

72
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,940
The next one is here.

73
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,540
This is the last one.

74
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Two seats up.

75
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,520
Three seats up.

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,640
With this,

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,380
we've secured all the three special seats

78
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,300
that Ryo-tsu had said.

79
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,560
It's easy.

80
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,140
Then,

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
we just have to wait and see until the afternoon of tomorrow.

82
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,000
You fool!

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,360
It's a mistake just to put on the seat and think you got the seat.

84
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll tell you how strict you are

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,140
about making yourself comfortable in a far-away land.

86
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,620
I'm getting changed.

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,480
Huh?

88
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,760
Imaimai should be next, right?

89
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,580
But Imai-kun suddenly stopped coming to work.

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,380
I was asked to be his agent because I was his high school friend.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,000
I see.

92
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Then, I'll leave it to you.

93
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes, please leave it to me.

94
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,400
I can't believe what the first person I met said.

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Yes, your turn.

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,620
What is this?

97
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,520
Are you motivated?

98
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,400
What?

99
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,960
You bastard!

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,640
I've always hated your eyebrows!

101
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,120
The dark circles under your eyes are more disgusting!

102
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,860
Is this a fight?

103
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,860
I think so.

104
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,920
You bastard!

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,460
Broom!

106
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to eat you up!

107
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,060
Broom!

108
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,020
That woman is Gifted, Magic Girl!

109
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,500
Broom!

110
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,600
Did you abandon Moken?

111
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,260
How dare you!

112
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,400
I won't ask for an agent!

113
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,760
What are you doing in my place?

114
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,440
How dare you leave the market!

115
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,580
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,120
You're the best, Nano-chan.

117
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,260
I-I got hit.

118
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,520
Here too.

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Kawashima!

120
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,060
What's wrong?

121
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,380
I-I got hit.

122
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,960
I got hit.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,020
It's dirty.

124
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,560
The seats were spread out all the way up there.

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,780
You don't know.

126
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,680
When I came, there was nothing on the seats.

127
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't be stupid!

128
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,600
You were blown up by the wind.

129
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,920
The wind wasn't blowing.

130
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,580
Now we have the right to hold all the iron ore.

131
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,340
Damn it. I got hit.

132
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
I don't know where to go.

133
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,160
The place is so hard.

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,320
You know how hard it is?

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes.

136
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,660
When you want to take a seat, don't ever fall off.

137
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,900
There are a lot of people who are aiming for special seats right now.

138
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
Such as...

139
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,300
You!

140
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,520
Come out!

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
You've been looking for me!

142
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,980
Thank you, Mr. Ryozu.

143
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,420
I didn't know you had noticed.

144
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,220
What are you guys?

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,940
We are trying to secure the place where the fireworks are going to be held.

146
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,560
But it's not a cherry tree here.

147
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,980
What?

148
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,440
Are they the people of the American government?

149
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,940
It seems that they are the immediate relatives of Vice President.

150
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,740
Vice President is a great Japanese man, and he is also familiar with cherry blossoms.

151
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,240
He hopes to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom.

152
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,620
Full bloom cherry blossoms?

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
It's a legendary cherry blossom that almost nobody knows about.

154
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
It's a legendary cherry blossom.

155
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,700
It blooms much faster than other cherry blossoms.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,080
After other cherry blossoms have fallen, it will continue to bloom for a while.

157
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,720
That's why it seems that it blooms all year round.

158
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,840
According to the research, it is said that it is located in the Okutama region.

159
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,400
However, Vice President's schedule for the next day is not yet clear.

160
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,720
Therefore, I want you to secure the special seat of the cherry blossom as long as you go to see the cherry blossoms.

161
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,020
Mr. Lee

162
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,960
This is a request from the Japanese government.

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,760
The Japanese government?

165
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,240
That means that a price will be issued, right?

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,540
Of course.

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,660
Oh!

168
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,920
Please leave it to me.

169
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,660
Let's deepen the friendship between Japan and the United States through cherry blossoms.

170
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
Oh! Thank you.

171
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,920
Thank you very much.

172
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,320
Damn it.

173
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,100
It's fast if I use a helicopter.

174
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,200
I'll make a hole.

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,140
It is said that it will scatter the cherry blossoms on the bridge, so the helicopter should not be used.

176
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,360
Haa...

177
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,020
Well, it can be a little large.

178
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,500
We will continue to walk from here.

179
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,800
What!

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,860
Oh!

181
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
There is a store.

182
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,260
Excuse me.

183
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,520
Welcome!

184
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,760
Oh, I can ask you for a moment.

185
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,340
How long does it take to get to the place where the full moon cherry is?

186
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,720
Full moon cherry? What's that?

187
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,180
It's a legendary cherry, so maybe even locals don't know about it.

188
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,740
There's nothing on this.

189
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,860
Don't say anything bad. Just take it back.

190
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
Okay, okay.

191
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,100
Hey!

192
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,600
There's no way out!

193
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,440
There's no other way?

194
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,100
Yeah, it's only this way.

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,440
We have no choice but to take it back.

196
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,580
It can't be helped.

197
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,940
Senpai!

198
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,720
You can get money just by taking the cherry blossoms!

199
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,820
Can you take it back with this?

200
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,780
I guess I'll have to go with you.

201
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
The bridge is gone!

202
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll go with you!

203
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,540
I guess we'll have to take it back.

204
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
Bulbul, the rope.

205
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:15,920
Okay.

206
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
Let's go!

207
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,520
I want to go home!

208
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,080
No matter how you look at it, this road has been closed for years!

209
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm tired.

210
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,700
Did they really come here to investigate?

211
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,740
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

212
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,140
No, they said they analyzed the satellite photos and determined the location.

213
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,380
That's right.

214
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,120
Damn it!

215
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,980
I can't move anymore.

216
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm at my limit, too.

217
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,720
Go ahead, Ryotsu.

218
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,840
What's wrong? Do your best!

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,540
Full moon cherry is almost there!

220
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,740
Come on, go ahead!

221
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,340
It's full moon cherry!

222
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,620
So...

223
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,260
it's full moon cherry.

224
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,320
It's an elixir!

225
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,820
It's beautiful.

226
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,260
I've never seen such a beautiful cherry tree.

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,980
But I don't think there's anyone who would come all the way here,

228
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,740
but is there any point in taking the place?

229
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,860
Whether it's meaningful or not, if you take the place here, you'll get money.

230
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
Let's enjoy it until Vice President comes.

231
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,840
Here, here, here, here, here.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,820
That's it, that's it, that's it.

233
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,460
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

234
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,320
Idiot.

235
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,380
I'll go wash my face.

236
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,820
What the hell?

237
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,060
What's wrong, Ryozu?

238
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,840
You're so cold.

239
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,300
You guys, look around.

240
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,660
Around!

241
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,980
When did you come to this place?

242
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,020
What's going on?

243
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,560
Saku?

244
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,160
When did you come to this place?

245
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,380
You can't just come in here without permission.

246
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,960
I took the place here.

247
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,000
You're the old man who went to the graveyard at the foot of the hill.

248
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,480
You said you don't know the Ten Thousand-Year Cherry Blossom.

249
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,920
You're lying.

250
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,040
But we worked so hard and finally got here.

251
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,440
How?

252
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,860
I'm the only one who knows the way out.

253
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,380
Now, you're the one who blocked the road and dropped the bridge.

254
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
You can't let me see the flowers here.

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
Absolutely not.

256
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,020
Who are you?

257
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,460
The smell of romance in the cherry blossoms is good.

258
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,340
I love cherry blossoms and go fast.

259
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,040
I'm going to protect the Ten Thousand-Year Cherry Blossom.

260
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,540
Cherry Blossom?

261
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,400
Ten Thousand-Year Cherry Blossom?

262
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,820
You're going to protect the Ten Thousand-Year Cherry Blossom?

263
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,700
It's known that there are beautiful cherry blossoms in this land.

264
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,300
I want to see the flowers.

265
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,220
Then I can build a mountain of garbage.

266
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,680
I can build a toilet.

267
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,140
I can climb trees.

268
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,400
I can cut the branches.

269
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,300
Then, the Ten Thousand-Year Cherry Blossom is over.

270
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,200
No, it's not.

271
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
I've blocked all the roads here.

272
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,920
Here it is.

273
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,960
Cherry Blossom Fairy Tale.

274
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,000
You're kidding.

275
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,960
It was your fault that you sent us to a place like that.

276
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,680
We came here on a government order.

277
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,820
Right.

278
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,220
We have to let the Vice President of the United States see the flowers.

279
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,120
We have to let the Vice President of the United States see the flowers.

280
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,900
There might be a crack in the relationship between Japan and America!

281
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,800
After hearing that, I can't afford to hand over this place any more.

282
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,540
What did you say?

283
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,860
If the Vice President of the United States finds out that I had a nosebleed,

284
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,240
the nosebleed will be gone from the world!

285
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,940
Who's there?!

286
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,020
Take this! The Cherry Blossom Wind Jutsu!

287
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,880
You can't do this!

288
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,260
The hole will fall!

289
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,360
But you're the President of the Year-Rolling Cherry Blossom World!

290
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,340
Cherry blossoms are most beautiful when they fall!

291
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,800
Ponga!

292
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,520
Balbo!

293
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,540
Sagonji!

294
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,540
Damn it!

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,920
I'll take that place back even if I have to!

296
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,600
That's my place!

297
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,160
You're so scary!

298
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,480
This is the Cherry Blossom Wind Jutsu!

299
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,320
The Cherry Blossom Wind Jutsu is a strange form of love.

300
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,920
Hm?

301
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,160
Hm?

302
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,380
Damn!

303
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
I'll never let that be!

304
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,520
I won't give up!

305
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:50,520
He fell asleep.

306
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,200
He's alone.

307
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,200
He can always escape.

308
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,500
Sakura!

309
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:02,880
Sakura!

310
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,220
He noticed!

311
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,540
He's here!

312
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm here!

313
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,380
Damn it!

314
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,060
I'm not going to get angry!

315
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,120
The Sakura Wind Jutsu!

316
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,140
Balba!

317
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,960
Damn it!

318
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,880
The Sakura Electric Jutsu!

319
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,840
Idiot!

320
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,240
If it's a thick rubber glove, it won't turn on!

321
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,380
I'll make you pay for this!

322
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:49,960
What are you doing?

323
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,680
Senpai, look!

324
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,600
Kuma!

325
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,860
Kuma!

326
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,600
I was afraid something like this might happen, so I brought the bears of this mountain together.

327
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,460
Ouch!

328
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,460
This is the Sakura Wind Jutsu.

329
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,860
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

330
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:27,920
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

331
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,860
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

332
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,900
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

333
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,580
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

334
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,680
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

335
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,340
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

336
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,340
Are you a man, a menace?

337
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
Man, this old man is a man!

338
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,280
Damn!

339
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,980
Wait!

340
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,940
We're friends!

341
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,220
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

342
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,080
We have to make a move soon.

343
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
The Sakura Wind Jutsu

344
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,940
The front lots of him!

345
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,420
Chompy!

346
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,360
I'm a mirror beast!

347
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,300
Not yet...

348
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,460
Damn, I'm so tired!

349
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,860
Ryotsu, can you hear me, Ryotsu?

350
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,240
Yes, this is Ryotsu.

351
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,620
Vice-President's schedule is early. He'll be coming tomorrow.

352
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,960
I think he'll arrive by noon. He must have taken his place.

353
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,020
Of course! I'm waiting for Vice-President to arrive!

354
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Well then...

355
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,060
Senpai...

356
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,300
In this case, there's only one way.

357
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,580
As you said, I'm on my way!

358
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,820
Let's go, Honda!

359
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,120
Alright!

360
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,640
Alright!

361
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
Let's go, guys!

362
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,360
It's a sakura block!

363
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,780
Get out of my way!

364
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,880
Break it!

365
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,300
Damn you! You're no match for me!

366
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,440
What?

367
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,100
The sakura mechanism!

368
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,300
You're not my match!

369
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,420
Shit!

370
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,980
I may end up losing a fight!

371
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,220
Your Kanilworth is in trouble!

372
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,280
You're so annoying!

373
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,300
How dare you try to steal my position!

374
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,700
Sakura Block Jets!

375
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,480
Now!

376
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,220
Hey, hey!

377
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh no! The special seat...!

378
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Yes.

379
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,320
Yeah...

380
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,680
Hey! Nagagawa!

381
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,060
Let the helicopter go down and chase after the bears!

382
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,980
Huh? Don't be so reckless!

383
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,120
We're going to do it! For the sake of my money and the future of Japan!

384
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,140
If you guys can't do it, I'll do it!

385
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,740
Hohoho...

386
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,100
The full moon will be seen soon, Vice-President.

387
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,120
Yeah...

388
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,580
What's with that helicopter?

389
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,760
Please stop, Senior!

390
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,740
We did it!

391
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,760
Who's there?

392
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,540
And also what's with the

393
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,000
The cherry blossoms?

394
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,880
The cherry blossoms...!

395
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,020
Don't tell me, that's...

396
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,060
Vice-President...

397
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,620
Huh?

398
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,440
What're you doing, Senior?

399
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,720
You're not in a bad place to say that.

400
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm just telling you that's my fault.

401
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,220
and you can only make up for the other person's anger.

402
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,660
That's right!

403
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,160
George Washington was the one who was like that!

404
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,600
What?

405
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,120
George Washington, the first president of the United States,

406
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,240
was honestly told that he cut the cherry tree in his youth,

407
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,200
and he was never scolded.

408
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,920
Of course, the vice president of the United States would know that!

409
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,300
If I confess honestly,

410
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,340
he'll have to forgive me!

411
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,300
I bet he'll have to forgive you!

412
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,820
Lyos!

413
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,600
Who are you?!

414
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,560
I'm sorry, Vice President!

415
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,520
I cut the cherry tree!

416
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,660
Forgive me, little boy!

417
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,480
Japan, I'm in charge!

418
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm hungry!

419
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,780
This is for the good of the United States.

420
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,760
You may scatter.

421
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,140
N-no!

422
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,080
Please don't!

423
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,580
I hate flower viewing!

424
00:23:48,540 --> 00:24:12,320
Subtitled by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

425
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,660
For that reason,

426
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,620
I walked only on the black road

427
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,360
we used to walk together as kids.

428
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:39,720
