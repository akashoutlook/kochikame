2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,280
I was drowsy and peeing in the middle of the river

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:24,340
I threw the dice and went up to the lake

4
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,700
From the tapestry of a pointed hat

5
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,980
The sun sets to the taishakuten

6
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this

7
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,620
I lost my happiness again

8
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,800
I realized

9
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm an idiot

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,900
I'm an idiot

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm an idiot

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,640
I'm an idiot

13
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,340
Ryo!

14
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,900
Thank you for the feast.

15
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,820
I didn't eat anything for three days without money.

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,420
Really?

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,620
Geez, I can't leave this place if Ryo-san is here.

18
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Are you going somewhere?

19
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
I was thinking of taking a break and going to the hot spring.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,600
But there are people who are hungry in the middle of the night and come to the kitchen.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,720
I'm worried and can't go anywhere.

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,340
No, Grandma.

23
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,980
Tomorrow is my day off, so I'll be fine for the rest of the day.

24
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,360
It's okay.

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,420
Go to your favorite place, whether it's a hot spring or not.

26
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:50,840
Really?

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,860
Yeah, it's okay.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,720
I don't want to steal the fun from the old people.

29
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,760
Is that so?

30
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,060
Actually, there is a cheap one at the town hall.

31
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,080
If you're okay with it, let's go.

32
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,840
Come on, come on.

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,140
Then I'll leave this to you.

35
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,680
What?

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,760
It's a fee.

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,400
A fee?

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,660
When something happens,

39
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,100
you have to pay for it.

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,240
Okay.

41
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,120
Grandma, leave Ryo to me and go to the hot spring.

42
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,040
What's this?

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,840
Today and tomorrow, the local government's Ryo-tsu teacher will be in charge of the replacement of Ryo-bo-san.

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,300
So don't be too serious and bother him.

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,820
Ryo-tsu.

46
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,500
Ryo-tsu is Ryo-bo-san?

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,200
That's kind of funny.

48
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,900
The first one is Prince Misawa.

49
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,440
The second one is Tsutaro Tsurutaro.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,180
Damn it.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,060
I'm completely destroyed.

52
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,380
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,840
But now I have enough money from my grandma.

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,580
I have to do something about it.

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,620
Hey, Ryo-tsu.

56
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,640
What's wrong with you guys?

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,200
The washing machine is not working.

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,180
Huh?

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
Oh, the washing machine.

60
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,360
See? It doesn't work at all, Ryo-tsu.

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,100
It's obvious if it's packed like this.

62
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,860
We should just pull the laundry out, right?

63
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,680
Yes, Ryo-bo-san. Please.

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,120
Damn it. It says you shouldn't bother me.

65
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
I can't stand it.

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,600
Take this!

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,980
Oh, what are you doing?

68
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,500
What?!

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,340
Oh no. I even got the screw out.

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,180
Senpai, what are you going to do?

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,100
This is just a box.

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Oh, wow.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,640
Wow. Oh, wow. What are you going to do?

74
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Please do something, Mr. Ryo.

75
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,540
That's right. I'm a wife.

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,380
I see. I see.

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
I'll go and clean it.

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,600
Really?

79
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,560
Yeah. Bring all the laundry.

80
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,380
I will.

81
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,860
Thank you.

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
Why me?

83
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,740
Isn't this your job?

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,860
I'm a wife.

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
Help each other when you're in trouble.

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm always like this when I'm in trouble.

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,700
I'm always like this when I'm in trouble.

88
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,760
What did you say?

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,480
I was wondering if there was a cleaning shop.

90
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,880
I was wondering if there was a cleaning shop.

91
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,280
For a coin laundry, it costs 200 yen per floor.

92
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,260
For a coin laundry, it costs 200 yen per floor.

93
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,680
If the cleaning fee is 2000 yen per person,

94
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,420
if I use the coin laundry,

95
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:32,980
if I use the coin laundry,

96
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,500
Honda!

97
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll clean it here!

98
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,300
Senpai, isn't this a coin laundry?

99
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,080
I know that.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll just have to wash the laundry.

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,280
Here, put your clothes in.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,820
And my clothes, too.

103
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,920
Senpai!

104
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,420
You, too, get out of here.

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,800
If you wash it together, the laundry will float.

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,860
No! No!

107
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,380
You don't know what you're doing.

108
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,300
Senpai, you're terrible.

109
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,740
What's wrong?

110
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,180
Calm down, Honda.

111
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,620
What's wrong?

112
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,560
Senpai, someone came.

113
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,100
No one comes in this mess.

114
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,860
No one comes in this mess.

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
No one comes in this mess.

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,360
What's wrong?

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,080
It's Reiko.

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,240
What?

119
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,620
I washed the laundry.

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,700
I washed the laundry.

121
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,440
I can't believe Reiko is coming.

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,320
What are you going to do, Senpai?

123
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,420
Hide.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,620
Hide? Where?

125
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Where?

126
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,880
On the ceiling!

127
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,700
What?

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,140
Hurry up!

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,700
Yes, sir!

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,580
Hurry up, Reiko.

131
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
No.

132
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,420
I can't go on.

133
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,840
I'll go first.

134
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,140
Ouch!

135
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,780
Ouch!

136
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Ouch!

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,620
Ouch!

138
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,340
Ouch!

139
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,480
You're a pervert!

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,720
You're a pervert!

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
I don't care!

142
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,780
Senpai...

143
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm sorry, Reiko.

144
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,940
You didn't hold back, did you?

145
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,880
Eh!?

146
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:44,940
Eh!?

147
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,420
Eh!?

148
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,340
What a crybaby you are!

149
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:50,780
Ugh.

150
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,380
You got away, didn't you?

151
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,980
How'd you get out?

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,660
You are such a show-off.

153
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,640
And there was this.

154
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,180
The dry-cleaner Reiko asked me to bring

155
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,080
to dry you to the working day.

156
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,600
And now there's the Chief.

157
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,660
Senpai...

158
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,900
I'll do it here.

159
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,140
It's enough to dry for 30 minutes.

160
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,860
I can't do this.

161
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,560
Honda, open the lid.

162
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,000
The lid is open.

163
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,340
I can't open it.

164
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,660
I'll burn to death.

165
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,420
I'll escape with all my strength.

166
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,680
Ryoichi, Honda, what are you doing?

167
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
You're an idiot.

168
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,040
But it looks like it's sunburned.

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,700
It's strange that you're alive.

170
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,280
Now all I have to do is press.

171
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,700
I'll do it here.

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,660
What?

173
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,760
Ryo, it's unusual.

174
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,540
Do you need anything?

175
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,260
The president asked me to do it.

176
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,620
Pressing laundry?

177
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,280
That's what happens in our factory.

178
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,840
It's okay if you can do it.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,180
Hey, I'm done cleaning.

180
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,180
Ryo, what is this?

181
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,800
It's like a brick.

182
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,220
I pressed it with a lot of glue.

183
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
My body is stretched and I can't move.

184
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,040
I can't do it because it hurts.

185
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,760
Do you get 2,000 yen for this?

186
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
Shut up. Don't say luxurious.

187
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,140
It was originally caused by a rag.

188
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,360
The one who broke the washing machine was Ryo-tsu.

189
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,940
Excuse me, Mr. Ryo.

190
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,960
I slipped in the bathroom.

191
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
You can't come back for the time being?

192
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,260
What does that mean?

193
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,980
It means that Ryo-tsu's wife will continue for the time being.

194
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,980
I don't want to do that!

195
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,920
What?

196
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,560
That's why we have to do something about the money we got from the

197
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,920
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

198
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,280
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

199
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,220
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

200
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,820
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

201
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,520
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

202
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,920
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

203
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:39,940
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from the

204
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:39,960
money we got from the money we got from the money we got from

205
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:39,980
the money we got from the money we got from the money we got from

206
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,020
the money we got from the money we got from the money we dashed

207
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,060
the money we got from the money we got from the money we got from

208
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,080
what?

209
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:43,900
..

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,520
Oh, you're 21 years old.

211
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,000
Mm-hmm.

212
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,500
Nice to meet you.

213
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,040
I feel like you're not bad, Senpai.

214
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,680
I-I think I'm good, too.

215
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,320
Well, let's move on to the evaluation.

216
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,480
Yes, you passed!

217
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm so happy!

218
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,980
You said you were okay!

219
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,520
H-hello. Nice to meet you.

220
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,160
Nice to meet you.

221
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,520
Oh, you're married!

222
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:29,600
You're married?

223
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,320
My hobbies are anime, figure skating, and game.

224
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,900
Game?

225
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,240
I'm particularly worried about the Doki Memo.

226
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,600
I'd like to ask you something.

227
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,380
What should I do to invite Saotome Saori to the pool?

228
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,760
Well, I have one right now, so would you like to try it?

229
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,380
Oh, you passed!

230
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,360
Nice to meet you.

231
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,680
You passed!

232
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,820
Nice to meet you.

233
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,540
Good luck to you both!

234
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,720
Here we are.

235
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,680
Nice to meet you!

236
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,180
Well...

237
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,660
Welcome!

238
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,560
So all seven rooms came together.

239
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Include your ten-month rent...

240
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,780
Make it 65,000 Yen...

241
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,620
...and that makes you 26,000 Yen.

242
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,060
That's an all-in-all 7,000 Yen.

243
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,520
We're at around 1.8 million Yen!

244
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
Well done, Ryo.

245
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,740
No, it's all thanks to everyone's help.

246
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,980
It's getting fun, Ryo.

247
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,740
The room...

248
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,700
No, no, it's too much.

249
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,500
Chief!

250
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,620
What's too much?

251
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,400
The room is empty and the manager is listening.

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,900
Why is the chief...

253
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,020
The Room is empty and the manager is listening.

254
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,340
Chief, why did you come back alone again?

255
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,000
My friend went back to his home today.

256
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,900
He came to take care of me tonight.

257
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,260
Is that so, Chief?

258
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,140
Can you wait a moment?

259
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,620
What are you going to do, Ryo?

260
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,020
I have no choice but to open a room somewhere.

261
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,820
Open whose room?

262
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,920
What?

263
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,060
Ah, ah, ah, ah?

264
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,440
What?

265
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,200
I have no choice but to sacrifice this place to Honda.

266
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,540
Yes.

267
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,120
Honda, tonight is the only night.

268
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,700
Oh, no!

269
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,440
Oh, it's pretty beautiful, isn't it?

270
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,380
Well, I have a tough eye.

271
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,040
Well, Chief, take your time.

272
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,240
Do it, do it.

273
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,500
Ouch!

274
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,780
You brat!

275
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,020
Ouch!

276
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,920
Ouch!

277
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,360
Ouch!

278
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,380
Ouch!

279
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,220
Ryo, what's wrong?

280
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,760
I, I, I can't do anything!

281
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,820
Chief!

282
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,920
There's no way you can't do anything!

283
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,080
Open the door!

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,420
Ryo!

285
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:09,880
Ouch!

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,520
Huh?

287
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,880
A tricycle?

288
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,500
Why is there a tricycle here?

289
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,240
Ryo.

290
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,860
Well, that's...

291
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,300
Ah, it's Honda's.

292
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,580
Ah.

293
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,560
Why does Honda have a tricycle?

294
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,300
Have you never seen a tricycle before?

295
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,000
A tricycle, isn't it?

296
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,880
It's clearly a tricycle.

297
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,000
I know.

298
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh, I see.

299
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:38,740
Ah.

300
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,440
A tricycle?

301
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,120
No, it's a tricycle.

302
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,960
It's a tricycle.

303
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,300
A tricycle.

304
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,360
Where are the tricycles?

305
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:46,800
It's a tricycle.

306
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,360
Si-si-si-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha.

307
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,440
If it has a handle, everything is okay.

308
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,140
One, two.

309
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,420
What?

310
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,120
One, two.

311
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,620
One, two, one, two, one, two.

312
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go dancing.

313
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,660
Let's go, let's go, let's go dancing.

314
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,640
Ryotsu, is there a woman here?

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,920
There's no way there is.

316
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,460
What's with that voice?

317
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,600
This is...

318
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,220
You must be hiding something.

319
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,080
Hiding?

320
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,580
What do you mean hiding?

321
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
This is the room.

322
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,160
Open it, Ryotsu.

323
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,040
But...

324
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,980
Get out of the way. I'll open it.

325
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,420
No, you can't, chief.

326
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,620
Why not?

327
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,740
As a human being...

328
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,480
What are you saying?

329
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,340
Let's dancing.

330
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,980
One, two, one, two.

331
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,220
Let's go, one, two, one, two, one, two.

332
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,940
Let's go, let's go dancing.

333
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,340
What do you want to do with me?

334
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,560
You're my lover, I got it all.

335
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm not just a AIDS patient.

336
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
I'm the only killer.

337
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,740
I'm the only one who's not the killer.

338
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm the only one who's not the killer!

339
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,320
Are you dead?

340
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,540
You broke my heart.

341
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm not a killer.

342
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:03,620
I'm the only one who's not a killer.

343
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,140
I'll go try and find that white monster.

344
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,200
Everybody dead.

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,060
Eخ! Ech!

346
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,540
Well, Chief, tonight we'll be staying in this room alone.

347
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,440
Take it easy.

348
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,180
If we don't lock the Chief up tonight,

349
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,360
he'll find out that we're renting a room for free.

350
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,480
But how?

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,120
That's what I'm trying to figure out!

352
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,620
Mr. Oya.

353
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,460
Huh?

354
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,700
Is the bath open?

355
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,960
Yes, it's open.

356
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,560
Come in, please.

357
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,700
Come in.

358
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,640
The floor is on your right.

359
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,080
Okay.

360
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,680
Senior, if the Chief finds out, it'll be over.

361
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,720
So don't even think about what to do!

362
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,760
You...

363
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,340
That's right!

364
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,040
Huh?

365
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,180
The Chief has been very busy lately.

366
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,680
That's it!

367
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,920
What do you mean?

368
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,880
Chief! What's the matter?

369
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,760
I was thinking of taking a bath.

370
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
Senior, this is bad.

371
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,240
I know.

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,260
Chief, actually...

373
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,660
I have a favor to ask you.

374
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,100
What is it?

375
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,660
Since the Chief is here tonight,

376
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,000
I'd like you to tell us about your favorite poem.

377
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,740
Huh?

378
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,180
You want to hear my favorite poem?

379
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,840
Please!

380
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,080
It's very popular in the Katsushika library.

381
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,860
Really?

382
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,940
Is my favorite poem that popular?

383
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,580
It's already very popular.

384
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,060
Please, please, let us hear your favorite poem.

385
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, I can't help it.

386
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,600
Please, let us hear it.

387
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,820
I understand.

388
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,320
Then, please prepare it in your room.

389
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,900
Huh...

390
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,720
Hey, Ryotsu.

391
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,660
The Chief is very popular.

392
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,700
But it's not just about popularity.

393
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,320
It's also about the fact that he's terrible.

394
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,360
What?

395
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,760
In the previous meeting,

396
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,980
he said that 30 people had fallen.

397
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,120
We can't afford to lose.

398
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,480
If this happens, we'll all be disqualified!

399
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,280
Why do we have to go with him?

400
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,880
He's so hardworking.

401
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,460
It'll take three hours to get home.

402
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,340
That's right!

403
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,200
You can call me at 4 or 5!

404
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,560
Now, we'll start the O-Hara Meijin's

405
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,960
Poem Concert.

406
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
O-Hara Meijin, please.

407
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,560
Then,

408
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,420
Bensei!

409
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,140
Shikushiku!

410
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,300
What's this?

411
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,220
The song is being turned off!

412
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,560
Gohan!

413
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,540
Gohan!

414
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:42,660
What?

415
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,900
This is terrible!

416
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,660
Again!

417
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,400
What's wrong, everyone?

418
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,500
No, the Chief is too hot.

419
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,300
I'm getting hot too.

420
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,680
I'll open the window.

421
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,640
Oh, no!

422
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,380
It's better to close it.

423
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,220
It's more effective.

424
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,480
Then, let's start from the beginning.

425
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:11,940
What?

426
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,440
From the beginning again?

427
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,040
Of course!

428
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,820
I can't believe I can hear the Chief's voice again!

429
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,360
Is there anything else I can be happy about?

430
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,560
Now, Chief, please start from the beginning again.

431
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,600
Then,

432
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,260
Bensei!

433
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,420
Chief, I'm sorry.

434
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,400
I'd like to ask you more, but

435
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,060
it's time for the power outage.

436
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,320
I see.

437
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,100
The temple is far away from home.

438
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
I'm sorry.

439
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,140
Oh, no.

440
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm so sorry.

441
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,560
Don't be so sorry, priest.

442
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,260
Huh?

443
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,240
I'll light you up again.

444
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,780
I'll call the priest and undo it.

445
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,060
Then, Bensei...

446
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,920
I need to go to the toilet.

447
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,080
Oh, yeah?

448
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,520
I too will...

449
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,200
No, Chief!

450
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,620
This is an area we haven't been around.

451
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,260
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

452
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,820
If you leave this room, everything will be over.

453
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,400
Yes.

454
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,060
There is something wrong.

455
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,800
You don't have to be patient here.

456
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,700
It seems so.

457
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,240
I'm sorry.

458
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,280
My dad will leave Kobe tonight.

459
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,040
I have to go to Tokyo Station.

460
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm sorry.

461
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,260
I'm a little ...

462
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,620
I see.

463
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,200
Everyone seems to be busy.

464
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,900
I'll leave it here tonight.

465
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,680
What?

466
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,560
Chief, you're wrong.

467
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,660
Nakagawa wants to listen more carefully.

468
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,200
What?

469
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,040
What?

470
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,160
There is no place for us to run away from you.

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,580
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

472
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm touched by your picture and I'm crying.

473
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,900
I see.

474
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
Then I'll cut it.

475
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,920
No, Chief.

476
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,100
You're the best in Japan.

477
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,020
It will be my revenge.

478
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,140
The mouse is running away.

479
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,840
The mouse ran away to the cockroach.

480
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,700
He goes aside.

481
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,240
Huh, I'm not!

482
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,740
Ah, what is this?

483
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,720
Yukimura!

484
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,320
Yukimura, it's cold!

485
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm almost done!

486
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,160
Mika, you guys!

487
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,560
I see. It'll be easier if you just faint.

488
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
Hey, Nakagawa!

489
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,140
Huh? Me too.

490
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,160
Sagonji, you too?

491
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,780
I'm getting better!

492
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,340
Kyuusen! Kousen!

493
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,500
I'm sorry!

494
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm sorry!

495
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,920
What? The air force is destroyed?

496
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,500
Senpai, we're going out tonight.

497
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,840
Okay.

498
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,700
It's over!

499
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,320
This is bad!

500
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,340
Senpai!

501
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,120
We can't take it anymore!

502
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,420
What happened?

503
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,240
It's a trap!

504
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm so sorry!

505
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,620
It's a trap!

506
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:38,880
It's a trap!

507
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,420
This is bad!

508
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,250
It's a trap!

509
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,600
What's wrong with you?

510
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,580
Please forgive me.

511
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,860
I'm sorry.

513
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,320
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,100
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,900
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,860
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,120
No, I'm sorry.

521
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,120
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,180
I'm sorry.

523
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm so sorry!

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,540
I was just trying to make you...

525
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,380
I'm sorry.

526
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,720
Please forgive me, please.

527
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,280
Don't worry!

528
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,560
Oh, no!

529
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,300
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,120
It's okay, Peters.

531
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,360
It's okay.

532
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,840
It's okay!

536
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,000
There are rumors that I am a girl who can not love

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,040
However, there are a lot of things I want to do

538
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:47,300
I want to run in a bike through a vast desert

539
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:53,780
I want to be free more than a bird

540
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,460
I want to run in a bike through a vast desert

541
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,540
A lady's dream that changes at the speed of a full moon

542
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm sorry, my love, wait for me

543
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,820
I'm sorry, my love, wait for me

544
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm sorry, my love, wait for me

545
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,040
I don't like it

546
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,560
It's quite bright

547
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,540
You can understand, right?

548
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm sorry, wait for me
