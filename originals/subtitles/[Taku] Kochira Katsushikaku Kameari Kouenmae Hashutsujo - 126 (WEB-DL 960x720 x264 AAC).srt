"Not

76
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,160
I think you all know him, but let me explain to beginners who don't know him.

77
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,960
His real name is Neruo Higurashi.

78
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,060
He works in the same police station as us, Kameari Park.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
He has superpowers such as awareness, drive and fire.

80
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,980
He solves unsolved cases one after another.

81
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,060
But he uses superpowers to use his body.

82
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,060
He consumes his body excessively.

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,140
That's why he sleeps 20, 50 hours more and more.

84
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,560
Finally, he wakes up only once every 4 years.

85
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,620
To be compared to the Olympics, people call him the Olympic man.

86
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,240
That's all.

87
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,600
What? Higurashi was walking?

88
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,280
But Higurashi must have been sleeping for 4 years.

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,780
He woke up in the year of the Atlanta Olympics.

90
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,640
The next one will be in 2000.

91
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,260
Isn't it?

92
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,500
Isn't it someone else's sky?

93
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,640
No, it's not.

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,360
I doubted for a moment, but there's no doubt about it.

95
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,620
He was wearing a business suit, but it was completely Higurashi.

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
Higurashi doesn't wear a suit.

97
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,220
And he was walking in Shinjuku.

98
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,820
But Higurashi gets really bad mood when he wakes up outside the Olympic city and goes crazy.

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,100
I see.

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,800
He woke up between Seoul Goring and Barcelona Goring.

101
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
He's more terrifying than the Daimajin.

102
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,700
He can easily blow up one or two buildings.

103
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,700
What?

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,900
So far, there's no damage to his supernatural powers, but it'll be bad if it happens.

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,500
Ryotsu, go and check Higurashi's room.

106
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

107
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,900
Senpai, you just need to check whether he's sleeping or not, but you don't have to dress like this.

108
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,080
You don't know because you've never woken him up.

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,340
I know.

110
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,740
But Higurashi's room is more terrifying than the Amazon jungle.

111
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,900
When I went to wake him up two and a half years ago, it was really scary.

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,460
I think it was the deepest room.

113
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,340
Huh?

114
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,280
It's too beautiful.

115
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,160
No way.

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,960
He's still awake.

117
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh, I can hear a song from inside.

118
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,080
What?

119
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,640
This is Kochikame's ending song.

120
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,880
No way.

121
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,100
The ending song he sang when he woke up was "Hofudiran's Smile", so he doesn't know the ending song now.

122
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,660
The key is not locked.

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,560
What?

124
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,540
Open the door.

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,920
We need to check the inside.

126
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,400
Yes.

127
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,040
What?

128
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
He's awake.

129
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,640
I knew it.

130
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,720
Hey, Higurashi.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,260
What?

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

133
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,420
Huh?

134
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,520
Honda-senpai.

135
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,060
What?

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,880
Isn't it Hinata?

137
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,480
Do you know him?

138
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,660
He's Kouki's junior.

139
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,540
Hey, why are you living in this room?

140
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,540
No way.

141
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,260
Ryochi-san, I've been living here for 4 years.

142
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,020
Isn't the most farthest room Higurashi's room?

143
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,520
Higurashi?

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,880
Oh, I remember.

145
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,960
There's a guy named Higurashi in the next room.

146
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,700
What?

147
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,440
He was kidnapped?

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh, I remember.

149
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,200
He was kidnapped last summer because he was expanding the side road.

150
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,700
I remember.

151
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,260
He was doing that construction.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,700
I remember.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,620
He was sleeping because his senior was in the way of the construction.

154
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,120
And he pulled Higurashi out of the way.

155
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,000
I see.

156
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,140
I totally forgot.

157
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,900
Oh, Ryo-chan.

158
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,260
So, where did you move the Higurashi?

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
Well...

160
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Oh, right.

161
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,360
I put it in the storage.

162
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,000
Huh?

163
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,200
There's no storage.

164
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,300
I think it's here.

165
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,500
Ryo-san, what are you doing?

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,060
Oh, grandma.

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,960
Where did you put the storage?

168
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,300
Oh, I forgot.

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,360
It's been so long since I opened the door, so I put it in the storage.

170
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,020
What?

171
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,380
Did something happen?

172
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,900
Higurashi was sleeping in there.

173
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,180
No way!

174
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,160
So, when did you put the storage out?

175
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,940
I think it was after the expansion of the road.

176
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Last summer, huh?

177
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,260
Oh, no.

178
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,280
All right, let's go to the garbage disposal center on Yume Island.

179
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,680
You mean around the summer garbage last year?

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,980
That's about it, I guess.

181
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,220
No wonder.

182
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,940
Now, let's go home.

183
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,960
Hey, tenon.

184
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,820
Ryo-chan.

185
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,140
How can you take care of a pile of garbage like that?

186
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,180
I got it.

187
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,320
Let's make it our building department.

188
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,580
That seemed sincere.

189
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,960
Ow.

190
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,300
Ow.

191
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
It's hard to find.

192
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,260
If the corpse is buried here, it's a complete crime.

193
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,240
Don't be so ungrateful!

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
We found a treasure chest!

195
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,980
That's it! No doubt about it!

196
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,900
There it is!

197
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,840
Tagumo, you're going to have to work harder.

198
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,280
I'll try again.

199
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,380
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,260
My heart is beating fast.

201
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,300
You've been here for over half a year, and you're still alive.

202
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,800
It's because I live here.

203
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,620
What are you doing? Get out of here!

204
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,700
Oh no! I'm in trouble!

205
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,660
That's me!

206
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,280
The one who brought me here,

207
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,920
I will not forgive anyone!

208
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,940
Oh no!

209
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,440
If they wake me up, I will be in a bad mood.

210
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,580
I will destroy everything!

211
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,820
Hey, stop it! Higurashi!

212
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Reiko! Higurashi is as weak as a devil, so please try to calm her anger!

213
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
What? Me?

214
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,080
That's enough! Hurry up!

215
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,300
Geez.

216
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,880
Higurashi-san, please calm her anger.

217
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,300
Please calm her anger.

218
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,080
Please...

219
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,580
Okay, we did it.

220
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,160
Reiko, you did well.

221
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,800
Nakagawa, Honda, take them to the station.

222
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,260
Yes, sir!

223
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,600
I heard that someone is going to make a big scene at the garbage disposal site on Yume Island.

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,300
That's you, you idiot!

225
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,060
I love you!

226
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,120
She's asleep...

227
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
Whew. We have to get out for now.

228
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,240
To be continued

229
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,840
To Be Continued

230
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,940
Part 2

231
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Next Episode

232
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,920
The End

233
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,180
Where's Higurashi?

234
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,040
He's somehow sleeping. He's a good sleeper.

235
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,820
Senpai, what are you going to do from now on?

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,620
Ryo doesn't have an empty room.

237
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,400
I can't just leave him here forever.

238
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,100
Higurashi has been sleeping in his room all this time.

239
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,940
Who was the person Ryo saw in Shinjuku?

240
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,440
I guess it was a mistake.

241
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,540
Hmm.

242
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,280
Okay, let's knock him out and see...

243
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,820
Hey, you idiot!

244
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,600
There's no one to wake him up even though you're being quiet!

245
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,120
That's right! What if he starts to go crazy again?

246
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,280
I see.

247
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
Then we have to leave him alone.

248
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,100
What?

249
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,860
What?

250
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,520
Yes, this is the exit of the park.

251
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes.

252
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,760
Huh? Three soba?

253
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,560
We don't have a soba restaurant.

254
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm here to get the bowl.

255
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,600
Good work.

256
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,260
Thanks for your hard work.

257
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,520
Idiot, don't make a loud noise!

258
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,980
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
What does this mean?

260
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:01,620
I don't know.

261
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,800
Ryo-chan, please do something.

262
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,060
If Higurashi stays here, I can't work.

263
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,500
But still...

264
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,100
What?

265
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,660
Hey, you should not cause an accident like that!

266
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,940
What will you do if Higurashi wake up?

267
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,120
What?

268
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,640
I...

269
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,800
Phew, that was a good save.

270
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,080
Well, that didn't even make such a loud noise.

271
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm a little relieved.

272
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
What?!

273
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,720
So you're the one who woke me up.

274
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,340
Even though the sound of the car accident didn't make any noise, why?!

275
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,320
Senpai!

276
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,300
H-Higurashi-san!

277
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,960
Reiko! Hurry and put Higurashi to sleep!

278
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,320
Higurashi-san, please put your anger to sleep!

279
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,100
Whoa!

280
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,220
Whoa!

281
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,780
Oh, it's all messed up!

282
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,060
Captain, you shouldn't put him to sleep!

283
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,840
What did you say?

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,340
Every time he wakes up, the whole town will be messed up!

285
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,020
In other words, you shouldn't put him to sleep!

286
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
But how?

287
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,980
I have a good idea.

288
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,260
Hey, Higurashi! Higurashi!

289
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:45,740
Huh?

290
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,240
You're waking me up again?

291
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,720
No, no, no! Calm down, Higurashi!

292
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,680
You're a bad sleeper!

293
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,420
I'm annoyed when you wake me up when I'm not sleeping.

294
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,520
What do you mean, you're not sleeping?

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,280
You've been sleeping for a year and a half.

296
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,160
Huh? I slept that long?

297
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
It's the 12th year of Heisei!

298
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,620
Japan is at a dead end because of the Shidoni Olympics!

299
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,240
Huh? Can you show me that newspaper?

300
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,780
Ugh, this is bad.

301
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,400
If I show you, you'll find out that I copied and cut and made a fake newspaper.

302
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,860
What are you doing?

303
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,700
Ugh, I was so bad at baseball!

304
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,820
I'm so sorry!

305
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,600
Ugh!

306
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:20,860
Ugh!

307
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,460
Ugh!

308
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,300
Ugh!

309
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,660
It's a little suspicious.

310
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,700
What? No, no, no!

311
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,560
Then what happened to Nostradamus' great prophecy?

312
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,900
Nothing happened.

313
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,220
Then what happened to Namie Amuro, who was a top idol four years ago?

314
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,300
She married a sub of TRF and has children.

315
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,380
Then what happened to Kenji Haga and Anna?

316
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,080
Ah, they finally broke up.

317
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,460
Eh?

318
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,080
Oh, I see.

319
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,380
It seems that she has been late in her time.

320
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,120
It's just a little while left.

321
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,660
Hey, how are you doing?

322
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,480
Ah, Chief, there's tea in the back.

323
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,300
Oh, thank you.

324
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,440
Oh, Higurashi, you woke up. It's been four years.

325
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,580
Ah, hello.

326
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,920
You all speak in a strange way.

327
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,660
No, it's not like that.

328
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,660
Nakagawa, can you turn on the radio for Higurashi?

329
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,760
Yes, please let me hear it.

330
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,100
Yes.

331
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,320
Ryotsu, I have something to tell you.

332
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,340
Yes, yes.

333
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,400
Well, I'll leave it to Nakagawa.

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,520
Yes.

335
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,860
Higurashi always goes to the Olympics when he wakes up.

336
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,660
That's right.

337
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,760
It's once every four years.

338
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,460
Hello, everyone in Japan.

339
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,800
We're broadcasting the final of the soccer game live from Sydney.

340
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,240
Ichikawa, cut the pass.

341
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,040
Just break the sideline and pass to Ono.

342
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
Ono, dribble!

343
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
One player missed in 'Taiwan'.

344
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,460
The Japanese soccer team went to the Olympics following Atlanta.

345
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,980
That's right. What's more, they were ahead of the final.

346
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,840
Such a killer pass!

347
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,720
Hanagizawa shoots.

348
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,760
In goes.

349
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,660
He's in the starting line-up, but he's not fast at all, huh?

350
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,940
I don't care about soccer anymore, I want to play Judo.

351
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,400
Huh?

352
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,880
Yes, sir.

353
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,260
Goal!

354
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,740
While watching the sunset, Yawara-chan is crying.

355
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,940
Please listen to this song!

356
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,220
Did Tamura win a gold medal?

357
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,120
It seems the match is over.

358
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,360
Are you playing women's volleyball? I love volleyball.

359
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,740
It's bad. I can't understand it clearly.

360
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,680
Chief, touch.

361
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
Even if you say that suddenly ...

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,740
Nakagawa-kun, switch quickly.

363
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,260
Chief, anything is fine. Hurry up!

364
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,300
The ace of women's volleyball, Kasai, this serve is shining.

365
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,020
I did it!

366
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,340
The Eastern witch, the demon's great victory ...

367
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,120
It's strange. This is a member of the Tokyo Olympics.

368
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,820
Wakagawa, break the radio.

369
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,340
Oh, my hand!

370
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,980
It's a pity. I can't hear anymore.

371
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,640
It's strange. I made a strange voice now.

372
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,060
Hey, Higurashi, you were playing the Olympics, right?

373
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,020
Now it's the 12th year of Heisei, right?

374
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,280
It's hard to believe.

375
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,020
I'll watch the Olympics on TV.

376
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,180
Hey, he!

377
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
It's no good! I can't, I can't watch TV!

378
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,460
Hello, I'm MHK.

379
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,760
I received the receiving fee for April 2011 ...

380
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,660
Heisei?

381
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,820
11 years?

382
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,100
Dangerous!

383
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,340
How dare you fool me!

384
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,020
Reiko, stop!

385
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,680
That's too dangerous. I can't get close.

386
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,480
Reiko!

387
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,980
Please do something about it with your power.

388
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,020
Please!

389
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,160
Thank you!

390
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,140
Oh!

391
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,780
Miss Higurashi, please calm down!

392
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,840
Ah!

393
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,220
Ah!

394
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,140
Ah!

395
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,260
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

396
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,880
Oh!

397
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,580
Ah!

398
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,700
Ah!

399
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,940
Ah!

400
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,180
Why do I always look awful?

401
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,380
If you say that you can't calm down just by Reiko,

402
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,840
I'll call Mars!

403
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,980
Maria!

404
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,980
Master Ryo!

405
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,720
Master Ryo!

406
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
Oh, Maria!

407
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,120
I'll definitely stop it for Master Ryo's sake!

408
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
Yeah! I asked for it!

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
Miss Higurashi, please calm down!

410
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,940
* maximize pressure*

411
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,140
Oh, I think you can pressure her with this!

412
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,960
Hmm?

413
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,780
Oh, it's the man!

414
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,960
Oh, no, no, I can't hold it off!

415
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm not coming!

416
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,440
A mysterious super power has appeared.

417
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,980
Tokyo is in a big mess.

418
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,420
We have to stop them.

419
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
I need to go out.

420
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,700
Chief, there's a meeting.

421
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,060
Join us online in real time.

422
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,340
Yes, sir.

423
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,560
Use the helicopter on the roof.

424
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,560
Yes, sir.

425
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,440
A super power has appeared.

426
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,560
I don't know if I can handle Godzilla.

427
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,960
You're the one who can't handle him.

428
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,340
What is that helicopter?

429
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,820
Who are you?

430
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,340
Who are you?

431
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,420
You're Higurashi, right?

432
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,500
What's going on?

433
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,200
Nice to meet you. I'm Higurashi Neruo's twin brother, Okio.

434
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,240
What? You're Higurashi's brother? I haven't heard from you for a while.

435
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,160
I don't talk about private matters much.

436
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,540
By the way, I've seen you in Keizai City.

437
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,100
That famous corporate warrior!

438
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,620
You know him?

439
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes.

440
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,360
He's an elite worker who's been running around the world for 40,000 hours for 4 years and has made millions of contracts.

441
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,080
He's a super corporate warrior who's been missing.

442
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,200
I see. So this is the man I saw in Shinjuku.

443
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,260
But he only comes here once a year.

444
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,680
I'm the only one who can stop him from going wild.

445
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,980
What? How?

446
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,300
Ryo-sama's here!

447
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,820
Hey, watch out!

448
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,440
Are you going to stop me in a year?

449
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,720
You hate me?

450
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,940
Yes, I do.

451
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,160
Ryo.

452
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,420
Hey-

453
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,860
Oh, you're like a child.

454
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
Are you the man I saw at the start?

455
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,740
No, I'm an elite worker.

456
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,400
Is that Ryo?

457
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,140
Yes.

458
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,820
So, do you even train in the fiber that spirit employed in that experience?

459
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,860
Yeah, I see.

460
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,640
About the other day, the answer was 20%...

461
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,180
Hey, don't talk!

462
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,600
Yes, I understand.

463
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,300
Then, as you see.

464
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,600
Ah! The barrier!

465
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,880
Yes, I'll ask you about that at 4 o'clock.

466
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,060
Yes, that's it.

467
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,840
He stopped in the air and was talking.

468
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,100
As expected of the company warrior.

469
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,900
After all, it's Okio.

470
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,040
I didn't expect him to come.

471
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Okio! Go back to the company and do your job!

472
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,200
Yes!

473
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,220
You sleep!

474
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,940
It's a huge fight.

475
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,780
It's a terrible fight.

476
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,240
I think I made a big change.

477
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,960
It's a missile attack of the Self-Defense Force!

478
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,960
You're too naive.

479
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,240
You're too naive.

480
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,360
You're too naive.

481
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,080
Okio, don't get in the way!

482
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,060
You go to sleep quickly!

483
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,180
Air Max Cell Extension!

484
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,820
I did it!

485
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,760
I did it!

486
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,580
It was a great fight.

487
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,160
Now he'll sleep again.

488
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,320
Yes.

489
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,940
Thanks to you, I woke up.

490
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,200
What? I'm still fine.

491
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,480
It seems that he has improved his power.

492
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,220
Brother, finish him off!

493
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,760
Hey, what's wrong?

494
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,740
What year is today? What month? What day?

495
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,020
He's been awake all the time, so he doesn't feel the day-to-day.

496
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,040
He's been awake all the time, so he doesn't feel the day-to-day.

497
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,380
It's May 16, 2021.

498
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,040
I knew it.

499
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,780
He's been awake all the time, and it's been four years.

500
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,360
He's in a state of sleep.

501
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,120
What? Wait a minute!

502
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,540
Hey, wake up!

503
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,780
You're the only one who can stop the day-to-day rampage!

504
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,960
It's the opposite of sleeping once in four years.

505
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,160
It's the opposite of sleeping once in four years.

506
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,480
It's not the time to say such a selfish thing.

507
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,520
Who woke me up?

508
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,980
Who woke me up?

509
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,440
Who woke me up?

510
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,160
Yeah!

511
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm already so overwhelmed.

512
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,420
Nightmare

513
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,480
Nightmare

514
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,660
Nightmare

515
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,260
Nightmare

516
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,300
Nightmare

517
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,500
Nightmare

518
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:20,700
Nightmare

519
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,600
If it's you, I want to wake up

520
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,500
Even boring stories

521
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Make my whole body hot

522
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,060
But I want to see my friends

523
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,060
I want to be loved

524
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,000
I want to be loved

525
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,560
I feel like we're melting

526
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,100
To the point where everyone gets annoyed

527
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:59,580
I want to shoot you

528
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,940
For some reason, love is only cowardly

529
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,080
Don't hide everything

530
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,180
That makes you strong

531
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,200
Rather know what's better

532
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,920
I want us to reach

533
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,300
This far

534
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,620
Call me

535
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:26,780
Call me

536
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,060
Call me

537
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,080
Don't hide

538
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,500
Don't hide

539
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,440
I want to be loved

540
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,280
I want to be loved

541
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
Don't hide

542
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,720
I want to be loved
