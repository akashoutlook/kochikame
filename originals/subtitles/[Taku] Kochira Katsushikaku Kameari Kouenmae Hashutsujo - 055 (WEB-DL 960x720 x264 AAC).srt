00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,540
"Nagakawa ni ukabu yuuhi wo megakete"

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,600
I kicked the pebbles and I flew to my shoes

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:33,240
I wonder if I should go to the gym I used to save money

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,940
I was laughed at for being a coward

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,500
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only win

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,720
The cityscape that doesn't change even one of the bad things is strangely gentle

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,380
From the fountain of the Tungari-boshi

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm going to the taishakuten

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,240
The sunset is falling

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow will end like this

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,900
I lost my happiness in Katsushika and Shibamata

13
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,740
I realized

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,340
I'm such a fool

15
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,540
I don't want to change

16
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,040
I heard there was a car operation there

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,280
That's the director

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,780
It's not like that

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:51,240
How's the cake?

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,420
Not bad

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,600
It's not bad.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Please do your best to keep the fire burning.

23
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,320
Thank you.

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,100
What's this line?

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,920
What do you think?

26
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,960
Ohara.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,140
Yes, I'm listening.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,480
Excuse me, what is this line?

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,760
It's a cheap program.

30
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,600
It's a picture of a favorite idol.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,800
It's a picture of a favorite idol.

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm going to take a picture with Nagase.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,820
What?

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,420
Is it a picture of a favorite idol?

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,420
What? A picture of a favorite idol?

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,960
Yes, it's a picture of a favorite idol.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,680
It's also the latest model that can take a picture with five idols.

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,980
Oh, a picture with an idol.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,260
It's a picture of a favorite idol.

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,000
I can take a picture with Ryouko Suihiro.

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,960
That's right, president.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,120
I can take a picture with Aurore Teruyo.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, a picture of a favorite idol.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,980
Oharu, president.

45
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,960
Are you going?

46
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, I am.

47
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,460
I'm going.

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm going.

49
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,980
I'm going.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm going.

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm going.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm going.

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm going.

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm going.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm going.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm going.

57
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,900
I'm going.

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm going.

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,540
I'm going.

60
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm going.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,980
Oh, there's only half a minute.

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,400
It's a picture of a favorite idol.

63
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:34,640
I want to eat a food of color.

64
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,960
I have to take a picture of it.

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,200
You're welcome.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
How do you use it?

67
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,100
It's my first time.

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,740
It's easy.

69
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,540
Stand in front of the machine, choose your favorite frame.

70
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,900
And your name is?

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm Suihiro Ryoko.

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,660
I'm Orore Teruyo.

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
That's Suihiro.

74
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,980
Ryos!

75
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,540
Chief and Boss!

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,000
What are you doing?

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,500
What?

78
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,420
Can you do that kind of work during working hours?

79
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,780
Can you do that kind of work during working hours?

80
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,400
Well, that's...

81
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,660
We want to experience what it's like to be young.

82
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,840
That's right!

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
What are you doing?

84
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,040
That's...

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,420
It's a public service.

86
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,260
You go to work for the public every day, don't you?

87
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,380
Oh, a public service?

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,200
That's right.

89
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,780
Then you should pay me.

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,920
What?

91
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,960
I said that I could take a picture with an idol.

92
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm sure you've got permission from the agency.

93
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,520
Well, that's...

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,600
Not yet.

95
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,520
That's nonsense!

96
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,460
That's illegal.

97
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,420
If you take that, I'll arrest you.

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Everyone, this program is free from now on.

99
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,660
Even if you pay me, I'll give you money.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Even if you pay me, I'll give you money.

101
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,180
Oh, you're not giving me anything.

102
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh, you're not giving me anything.

103
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,760
Oh, you're not giving me anything.

104
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,220
Oh, you're not giving me anything.

105
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm here to careful.

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,900
Oh, you're here to careful.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,420
I'm going to make some trouble.

108
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm going to make some trouble.

109
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm going to make some trouble.

110
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,160
I have to use the public service.

111
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,620
Oh, the public service?

112
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,940
You're going to leave yoursleves behind, right?

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:38,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,500
Have a good day.

115
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,060
Bye.

116
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,820
Hehehe...

117
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,520
I'll revenge.

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,260
Even if it's the chief or the chief,

119
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,060
I won't let this grudge last!

120
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,040
So, I feel like I'm ten years younger now.

121
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,760
And this is the "Purikura" I got at that time.

122
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,500
The chief and the chief are so cute!

123
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,680
Really?

124
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,100
Hehehe...

125
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,820
Look at this.

126
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,940
I'll make a picture of them in the "Purikura"

127
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,080
and post it everywhere.

128
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
I know, I know.

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,420
I was surprised by that popularity.

130
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,780
I'll go to the library.

131
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,640
Yes, sir!

132
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,160
Alright.

133
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,400
You're not going to take a picture of me, are you?

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,160
Turn around, turn around!

135
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,940
You!

136
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,260
There's a place on the right, on the second street.

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,780
Thank you very much.

138
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,880
See you.

139
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,720
Ouch!

140
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,760
This time...

141
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,880
...is my chance!

142
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,940
Oh, there's a lot.

143
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
Here, let me help you.

144
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,240
Sorry.

145
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,300
What?

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,040
This is it.

147
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,940
Let me explain.

148
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,720
What appeared beyond the wall is a spy scope, right?

149
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,140
The outside view is reflected in the mirror inside.

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,900
If you attach this in front of the digital camera,

151
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,580
the chief's stupid face can be taken.

152
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,440
Hehehe...

153
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,480
This is perfect.

154
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,620
What's this?

155
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,660
This is in the way.

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,260
You idiot!

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,300
Stop it, you idiot!

158
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,900
Hey!

159
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,980
Are you alright?

160
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,140
Hey!

161
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm fine!

162
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,440
This time...

163
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,140
...um...

164
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,340
Oh?

165
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, it's a spy!

166
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
It's a spy!

167
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,640
Hey!

168
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,640
It's a spy!

169
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,880
It's a spy!

170
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,460
It's a spy!

171
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,700
It's a spy!

172
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,180
The spy has appeared!

173
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,700
It's a spy!

174
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:46,820
What's wrong?

175
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,220
That's a spy?

176
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:49,900
It's a spy that can be Academ skipping me?

177
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,840
There's not enough.

178
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,280
No more.

179
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,540
I've learned.

180
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,060
I've learned.

181
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,840
I don't believe you.

182
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,020
It hurts.

183
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,240
What? What? What?

184
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,620
Now it's OK.

185
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,140
I'll let you know what will happen if you make me angry.

186
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm hungry.

187
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm hungry.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm hungry.

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm hungry.

190
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm hungry.

191
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,680
Who is it? Who did this?

192
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,000
What is this, boss?

193
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,300
I don't know. I don't know, Jimmy.

194
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,240
I'm hungry.

195
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,340
I'm hungry.

196
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,800
Who did this?

197
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:28,960
Who did this?

198
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,620
You don't remember taking this photo, do you?

199
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,900
Of course not. I've never done anything like this before.

200
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,320
I see. I see. I see.

201
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,640
What? Really?

202
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,600
Look. Look at these two faces.

203
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,760
No, no. They look exactly the same.

204
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,900
This is a composite photo.

205
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,120
A composite photo?

206
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,480
This is a trick to take a composite photo with an idol.

207
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,460
That's their trick.

208
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Damn it.

209
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,540
Prepare yourself, Ryosu.

210
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,420
What do they look like now?

211
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,100
Look at them.

212
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,140
Where should I put the rest?

213
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:22,880
I'll put this on.

214
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
Bastard.

215
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,160
Give it to me.

216
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,720
Not just anybody, but me, too.

217
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,220
Here.

218
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,500
Say, "Heave ho!"

219
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,520
Excuse me.

220
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:38,580
Thank you.

221
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,800
Thank you.

222
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Double-cross?

223
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,940
Heave-ho.

224
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Neru.

225
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,320
Thank you.

226
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,740
Thank you.

227
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,100
Thank you.

228
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,640
I can get two.

229
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,160
Are you serious?

230
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,840
My boyfriend was really worried about me.

231
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,360
Are you sure?

232
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,820
He's so crazy about me!

233
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Work is done!

234
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,420
Br Forever: Congratulations young

235
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,140
Br Forever: Good work and please keep working hard

236
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,360
Maaf

237
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,800
Why you guys are always so mean?

238
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,500
Episode 1: The

239
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,780
Hey, did you hear about the Puri-Kura incident?

240
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
That's terrible.

241
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,320
That's also the work of the primitive people, right?

242
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,740
Who are the primitive people?

243
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,260
Oh, you're doing the poll again.

244
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,200
Huh?

245
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,340
A poll for the police in the 23rd district of Tokyo?

246
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,260
The poll for the police in the 23rd district of Tokyo?

247
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,420
The man who doesn't want to marry is the first to enter the first place, Ryo Tsukankichi!

248
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,860
It's a great top again.

249
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,640
And the difference between the second place is spreading.

250
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,440
I didn't get to see the Ogeretsu seal the other day.

251
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
That's right.

252
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,400
Mr. Honda!

253
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
What's wrong with you?

254
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,240
Do you have a problem with me?

255
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,380
But look at that.

256
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm ranked 7th in the Worst.

257
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,060
That's right.

258
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Hahaha!

259
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,420
Hahaha!

260
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,200
You're as unpopular as me, aren't you?

261
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,300
Come on, let's do it!

262
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,740
No, I'm not.

263
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,660
I was hated just because I was good friends with my seniors.

264
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,520
Hmm?

265
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,140
Come to think of it, you were completely out of rank last time.

266
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,180
Tch!

267
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:40,900
Huh?

268
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,120
Wow!

269
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,480
What are you doing?

270
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,080
You bastard!

271
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,220
It's a good time!

272
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,500
It's not a good time!

273
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,100
Huh?

274
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,820
You guys did it anyway, right?

275
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,760
I can't stand it!

276
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,160
What kind of guy is he?

277
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,200
Wait a minute.

278
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,060
I'll show you the proof.

279
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,900
How long are you going to keep me waiting?

280
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,480
Tch!

281
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,840
Ah!

282
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,580
Ah!

283
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,300
Ah!

284
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,480
Ah!

285
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,760
How is it?

286
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,560
It's still this time.

287
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,320
The man I don't want to marry, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

288
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,280
The reason is, he's mean, vulgar, and I hate his face.

289
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,900
The man I don't want to marry, that's Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

290
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,000
The reason is, he's a human.

291
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,720
So, Ryo-tsu Kankichi, do you know what you're doing?

292
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,740
The man I don't want to marry.

293
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,580
Yes, I'm going to marry him!

294
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,080
No!

295
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,580
Wait!

296
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,160
Can you see?

297
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,920
Don't worry, I'll tell the director.

298
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Just do it.

299
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,920
Katsuo, are you okay?

300
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,160
That's it!

301
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,760
Sir.

302
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,380
I can't believe it.

303
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,700
I don't know who you are.

304
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,140
I just wanted to make sure I was sure that I was up at the right time.

305
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,660
I don't know you.

306
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:45,700
I can't believe it.

307
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah, I don't know.

308
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,760
The president named me either.

309
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,260
Nobody told me about it.

310
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,780
There's also a game contest.

311
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,300
The first one is the computer game that my senior wanted,

312
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,680
Fight the P...

313
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,700
What? Is that true?

314
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,000
Of course it is.

315
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,980
It's you again.

316
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,980
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,140
I can't invite you.

318
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
Anyway, Reiko,

319
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,800
I wonder if you have any ideas.

320
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,600
I'm not sure about the event.

321
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,700
It's just a karaoke and a game contest.

322
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I see.

323
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,820
I think Ryo is the best at this kind of thing.

324
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,220
What?

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
What's with that look?

326
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,180
Ryo, do you have any good ideas?

327
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,500
Who's doing this for you?

328
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,860
Senior, you should have a good time here.

329
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,920
You can have a feast.

330
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,580
By the way, I'm in a bad condition because of the Pricula.

331
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,320
I have a chance to eat.

332
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,660
The game software is also attractive.

333
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,480
How about a firefly show with your fiancé?

334
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,740
What?

335
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,680
Firefly show?

336
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:52,880
Firefly?

337
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,060
In this season?

338
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,920
I have some friends.

339
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,020
I can get about 50 fireflies.

340
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,700
That's great.

341
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,900
Let's go.

342
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,780
The moon and fireflies are romantic.

343
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,420
But...

344
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
If you invite such primitive people,

345
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,600
they will be so happy.

346
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,740
It's okay to talk about fireflies.

347
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,520
And Ryo is strong.

348
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,940
If I invite you,

349
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,300
the preparation of the party will be very helpful.

350
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,020
Hmm...

351
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,960
In exchange, if you can't eat fireflies,

352
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I will go home soon.

353
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,920
Let's shoot them together.

354
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,840
What?

355
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,400
Have some fun!

356
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,280
Come on, go for it.

357
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,240
Come on, good boy.

358
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,180
And now I'm gonna have a dinner party.

359
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,620
I don't think you can really do something like that.

360
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,860
Then I'm gonna work hard.

361
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,600
This is so cool, I can't believe it's working.

362
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,860
Okay, then I'll go to the firefly.

363
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,080
I'm so sorry.

364
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,100
Ryo, come on.

365
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,700
Hey!

366
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,720
It's your turn now.

367
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:51,940
Goodbye.

368
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:52,920
What?

369
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,160
This isn't the party!

370
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,700
Huh?

371
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm not joking!

372
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,360
What are you talking about?

373
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,180
I already paid the fire bill!

374
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,820
Hey!

375
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,980
You just said it was canceled!

376
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,260
What's wrong?

377
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,700
What's wrong?

378
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,740
Komachi and Naoko haven't come back yet.

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,340
They didn't respond to me, no matter how much I called them.

380
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,180
They were acting weird, so I thought I'd go look for them.

381
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,740
I see.

382
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,280
Did something happen?

383
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,200
Do you have any idea?

384
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,000
By the way, a car from the

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,640
What kind of car?

386
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,140
I think it's a Knight Rider.

387
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Knight Rider?

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,100
They're bad guys with a badge.

389
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,040
Come on, Honza!

390
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,940
Oh, no!

391
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm counting on you, Honza!

392
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,100
Leave it to me!

393
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,860
Are you okay?

394
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,140
If there's a Knight Rider involved, there are more than 100 people.

395
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,760
What?

396
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,740
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,220
Honza, do you know where they're going to get away with this?

399
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,240
Take care of those guys and let them go!

400
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,320
Hey!

401
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,100
You didn't pay for that.

402
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,240
You bastard!

403
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
What did you do that for?

404
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,480
What are you doing, regimes?

405
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,620
No, no.

406
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,340
You can't do that.

407
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,480
Hey.

408
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,640
You're so annoying, Ama!

409
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,060
I'll teach you a lesson about how to fight us!

410
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,220
Hey, bring her here!

411
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,480
Do you know who this guy is?

412
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,540
I'll use this to seal your nude and get you out of town!

413
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,500
No!

414
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,640
Come on!

415
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,340
Come on, pull her back!

416
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,100
Who are you?

417
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,220
Looks like you made it in time.

418
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,160
Mr. Genji!

419
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,860
You're my friend? Get him!

420
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,540
Is that all you've got?

421
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,060
Honda!

422
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,840
No need to hold back!

423
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,440
Just go at it!

424
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,000
Get him!

425
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,860
We've got pretty much everything.

426
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,040
Now, what do you want to do?!

427
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,620
Damn you!

428
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,520
This is what I'll do!

429
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,720
Komachi!

430
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,200
You!

431
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,000
Get out of my way!

432
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Shut up, you coward!

433
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
You're so mean!

434
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,440
I can't even talk to you, you know.

435
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,500
What the hell are you talking about?

436
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,540
Don't underestimate me!

437
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,980
I'm gonna do it!

438
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,120
You idiot!

439
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,800
You came all the way here,

440
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,860
and there's no escape!

441
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,200
Move, Komachi!

442
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,380
Komachi!

443
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,860
Go away!

444
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,500
I'm not...

445
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,460
Who are you, Chyurepi...

446
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:06,360
Hey, stop...

447
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,900
Stop!

448
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,360
Stop, why?

449
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,220
What's going on?

450
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,520
Don't, don't! Smile more!

451
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,700
Here, butter.

452
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,660
Listen, you guys.

453
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,280
If you do anything this time, I'll give this sticker to the rioters all over the country!

454
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,280
That's all we need!

455
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,040
I'm surprised!

456
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,320
He defeated dozens of people by himself!

457
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,300
He'd be a good example in such a situation!

458
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,360
I've looked him over.

459
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,060
I'm impressed by his wildness.

460
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,300
Yeah, he's kind when he's married.

461
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,680
He's better than a weak person.

462
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,580
Ryo seems to have gained a lot of weight.

463
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,820
Yeah.

464
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,380
48, 49, 50.

465
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,040
Okay, I'll give you 50.

466
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,960
A firefly in this season.

467
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,840
Can you give me that firefly?

468
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,940
I'm not kidding.

469
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,200
I got it tonight because I needed it.

470
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,860
I'm not saying it's free.

471
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,700
One.

472
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,980
1,000 yen per one.

473
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,100
No, 2,000 yen.

474
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
What should I do with it?

475
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,460
3,000 yen!

476
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,320
Plus consumption!

477
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,280
I won!

478
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,780
You sold it!

479
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,780
At last, I've earned 157,500 yen.

480
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,460
But I don't know how I'm going to fool Mikai.

481
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,820
I see.

482
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,340
Ryo-chan, you're late.

483
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah, I'm late.

484
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,400
You're here at last.

485
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,700
Hurry up, Ryo-tsu.

486
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,140
The chief came to see the firefly.

487
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,680
Well, well, Ohara-kun.

488
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,440
Yes, yes.

489
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,040
Don't rush.

490
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,460
Don't rush.

491
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,280
It's beautiful.

492
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,520
It's romantic.

493
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,420
We've been misunderstanding you.

494
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm sorry.

495
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,500
As long as you understand.

496
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,320
That's weird.

497
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,540
This firefly doesn't blink at all.

498
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,520
You're right.

499
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,900
Ryo-kun.

500
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,460
Gen-chan, look.

501
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,880
Look, isn't it beautiful?

502
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,840
It's a cockroach!

503
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,280
What?

504
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,200
It's a bug!

505
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,260
It's painted with fluorescent paint.

506
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,800
Hey, Ryo-kun.

507
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,600
What?

508
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:35,880
Wow.

509
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
I'm a little scared.

510
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,540
Are you in danger?

511
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,400
It strange.

512
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,140
Ryo-chan.

513
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,420
W, what!

514
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,200
What?

515
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

516
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,340
Ah, no!

517
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,260
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

518
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,960
If it's a cockroach and a firefly,

519
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,360
that won't change much, does it?

520
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,020
Seem to be a peace of mind.

521
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,820
Hey, hey, old man! What kind of flashy life are you living?

522
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,160
You're eating such a greasy thing!

523
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,460
It's already 106, right?

524
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,080
Even if you think a little about your age and come to the second challenge, I don't know!
