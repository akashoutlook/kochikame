2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,240
I look at the sunset floating in the river

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:24,480
I kick the pebble and it flies to the shoes

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,700
I wonder if it's a good idea to save money

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,040
He laughed at me as it was

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,760
Even if I try to cheer up, I can't do anything

7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,440
The cityscape that doesn't change even a single wail

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,920
It's surprisingly gentle

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,460
I look at the sunset floating in the river

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,300
I kick the pebble and it flies to the shoes

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,400
I kick the pebble and it flies to the shoes

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,980
The sun sets

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,520
Tomorrow will end like this

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,500
I lost my happiness because of the Katsushika Shiba

15
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,740
I realized

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,000
How stupid I am

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,560
Mo "Nakagawa "No Father

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,420
Shina

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,380
No father

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,100
Kato

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,000
án

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,000
Потому

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,720
Because

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,860
Yeah, because everyone's putting their lives on the line for the railway model.

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,340
That guy used too much money on the railway model and got away from his wife.

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,060
And the guy next to him just made a 1/2 scale SL,

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,720
and he's in trouble with the location, so he bought a new house.

28
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,940
But that stupid leader is Ryo-sama, right?

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,620
Yeah, I'm the stupidest...

30
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,180
Hey, what are you making me say?

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm not stupid.

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,100
SL is great, after all.

33
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,520
Hey, Ryo-san!

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,100
What are you doing?

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,480
Let's go to the station.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,220
Hurry up!

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,300
Hurry up!

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,600
Why are there so many people?

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,380
There's no way. This is the last time SL will run here.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah, this railway will be a waste of money.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,620
It's a pity that there aren't many railways that can run SL.

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Here it comes!

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Ryo-chan!

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,160
Huh?

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,000
Ryo-chan! Ryo-chan!

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Ryo-chan! Come here!

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,540
Come here!

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,040
Hey, Nori-chan!

49
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,180
I got a place for Ryo-chan.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,220
Sorry, Nori-chan.

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,620
Of course, this is for my darling.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,720
D-Darling?

53
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,100
Ryo-sama, you're so mean to me!

54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,360
Don't get me wrong.

55
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,680
Nori-chan is a man with the same P as you.

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,680
Huh?

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,060
Ryo-chan, who is this special person?

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,940
Is it me?

59
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,960
Then it's fine, but this is the one.

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,760
Oh, I see.

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
We're a good match.

62
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,920
What's your name?

63
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,660
I'm Asato Ai.

64
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,920
Please call me Maria.

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,980
Maria-chan?

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm Nori-chan.

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,740
Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,340
I'll be back later.

69
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,120
Nori-chan, I'll take a picture of you.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
Hey, guys!

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,040
Get ready.

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,640
Excuse me.

73
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,920
Ryo-chan, help me when the shooting is over.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah, leave it to me.

75
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,900
Yeah, leave it to me.

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,220
This is the last scene from the shoot.

77
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,420
The shooting is over.

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,580
It's time to go to the market.

79
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,520
The famous Okama bento of Oge is this one!

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,660
Welcome, welcome!

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,860
Okama bento?

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,020
Thank you very much!

83
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,240
Here you are, thank you!

84
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,920
Thank you so much!

85
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,440
Thank you, everyone!

86
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,600
"Oka-ma Bento"

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
Nori-chan's Okama Bento is still very popular.

88
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,340
You really sold out all of them.

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,840
In the end, we were too lazy to eat them.

90
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,440
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,140
We left some for you.

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,060
Oh, as expected of Nori-chan!

93
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,040
Let's eat!

94
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,860
It's delicious!

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,660
Right?

96
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,940
This Nori-chan's Okama Bento is the best in Japan.

97
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,800
It's the best in Japan.

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you, Ryo-chan.

99
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,140
But this is the last thing I can ask you to eat.

100
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,620
I'm getting old, so I'm going to quit.

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,160
What?

102
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,700
You want to see me come here every year, right?

103
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,080
You want to eat this Nori-chan's bento!

104
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,540
You're going to quit that?

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
I want to keep going.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,060
But it can't be helped if it goes to waste.

107
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,660
I can't help it if it goes to waste.

108
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,360
Nori-chan.

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,380
I have an idea!

110
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,440
I won't let you go to waste!

111
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,860
What?

112
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,940
Leave it to me as if you were on a big boat!

113
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,740
Ryo-chan.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,240
Ryo-sama, are you sure you want to do that?

115
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,660
Don't worry.

116
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,720
I have a walking cash box called Nagagawa.

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,780
Well, if it's you, Ryo-sama.

118
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,380
But I've been a little jealous of Nori-chan.

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,740
Hey, hey, don't misunderstand!

120
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,240
I just want to keep the taste of that bento and good memories with Nori-chan.

121
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
Memories?

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,860
That's a story from decades ago.

123
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,980
When I was in elementary school, I had a fight with my father and left the house.

124
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,380
I left home, but the money arrived immediately.

125
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,340
I got hungry and went to the other side of the road at the bench at the station.

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,040
Oh, I see.

127
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm hungry.

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm hungry right now.

129
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,660
If you don't mind, I'll take your meal.

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,820
Eh...

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
But I don't have money.

132
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,060
I don't need money.

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Really?

134
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,160
Thank you!

135
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,660
Nori-chan...

136
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,980
She didn't even tell me about my escape.

137
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,700
She just smiled at me.

138
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,760
And he gave me a ticket to the train on the way back.

139
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,040
I still remember the taste of the lunch and Nori-chan's kindness.

140
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,500
Well, Nori-chan has grown up a lot.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,340
That's a very good story, Barrio-sama.

142
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,760
Please let me continue my work at the station.

143
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,180
Yeah!

144
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,060
What? Stop the police!

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
Actually, I was invited to participate in a big project

146
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,220
that was the result of the good fortune of Nakagawa Group.

147
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,100
A big project? What is it?

148
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,020
It's a very good plan to build a road that will be able to cross the Pacific Ocean

149
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,520
and the Pacific Ocean by 2033.

150
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,980
It's 35 years ago!

151
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,740
Barrio-sama, what if Nakagawa-san of Peiuri is gone, and Nori-chan...

152
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,800
Hey!

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,160
It's not that!

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,780
You're the police officer!

155
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,240
You're serious!

156
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,200
You should refuse!

157
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,220
Of course I refused!

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
But my father won't forgive me!

159
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,680
You!

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,320
You're the police officer because you like being a police officer!

161
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,820
You can quit as soon as your father orders you to!

162
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,080
Sen...Senpai...

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,140
I'm sad.

164
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,620
I thought Nakagawa was born to be a police officer.

165
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,060
Senpai, don't say that about me!

166
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,580
He's done one more thing.

167
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,900
He's called Ryo-chan Kei-chan, who was born before the park.

168
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,540
If he hadn't done it, he would have wanted to be a milst buttock!

169
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,120
Isn't this a 'manzai ?'

170
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,020
Is it okay you just leave Nakagawa?

171
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,420
I-I don't think so...

172
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,060
Then why not stop?

173
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,880
Nakagawa, how about a talk with him?

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,980
Do you think you can do that?

175
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,780
Fine, I'll try!

176
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,720
Sen...Senpai!

177
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,200
Huh?

178
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,680
Never saw Nakagawa's father though.

179
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,140
I've never seen it.

180
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,060
I've never seen it either.

181
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,320
Me neither.

182
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,540
Actually, I've only seen it about three times since I was born,

183
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,280
and I don't remember its face very well.

184
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,920
What?

185
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,180
What did you say?

186
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,220
What kind of father is he?

187
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,440
He's a super businessman.

188
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
He only sleeps for five minutes every three days.

189
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,460
He's still the boss of the company,

190
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,100
so he can work 72 hours a day.

191
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't you have any family photos?

192
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,500
I do, but...

193
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,720
This is the only photo of my father.

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,920
Is your father Nessie from Nesco?

195
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,720
His name is Ryoichiro Nakagawa,

196
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,060
but I can't contact him.

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,700
He's been around the world.

198
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,460
Just contact the company.

199
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
I don't think it's possible.

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,660
Don't you want to continue being a policeman?

201
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,160
I-I understand.

202
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,920
I'll contact him.

203
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
I'll contact him.

204
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

205
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,540
I'd like to meet the president.

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Huh?

207
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,760
I have to make a reservation for a meeting?

208
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,040
I don't think it's possible.

209
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,100
Hello.

210
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,780
It's November 31st, 2011.

211
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,920
It's available from 11:00 to 3:00 p.m.

212
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,540
What?

213
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,220
Don't let him fool around.

214
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,000
Give it to me.

215
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,380
Hey,

216
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,500
your son is Ae.

217
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,020
Yeah.

218
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,100
Damn it.

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm fired.

220
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,280
Nakagawa,

221
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm going to meet him in person.

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Wait, Senpai.

223
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,760
This is my father's schedule.

224
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
He's really sick.

225
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,580
He's not in the same place as Go-Fun.

226
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,260
Luckily,

227
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,560
I've been in Japan for the first time in 10 years.

228
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,160
I have 8 hours and 25 minutes left.

229
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,200
Are you coming here 11 years from now?

230
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,600
Yes.

231
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,300
You're like a

232
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,760
Parisian.

233
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,460
You're a father like Suisei.

234
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,000
I see him!

235
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Huh?

236
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,800
That's him!

237
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,340
Oh!

238
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,100
What a pervert!

239
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,120
Why are there so many helicopters?

240
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,020
I have no objection.

241
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,800
Huh?

242
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,960
Take this!

243
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,600
Sir, we have 30 seconds left until we get there.

244
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,660
Please give this document a copy.

245
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,940
All right.

246
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,040
I'll do it for 15 seconds.

247
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,760
Put it in here.

248
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,060
What?

249
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,720
Where did it go?

250
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:51,940
Oh!

251
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,420
Take this!

252
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,200
Thank you very much.

253
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,420
Sir, please copy this document.

254
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,060
I have no objection.

255
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,880
I have no time.

256
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,620
You have 15 seconds left until you get a drink.

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,380
Which one would you like?

259
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,780
I'm a bit sleepy.

260
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,320
Then I'll have a Super Ultra Super Drink.

261
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,940
Here you are.

262
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,780
Hmm?

263
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,600
Hmm?

264
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,800
Ahh!

265
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,140
Here, here, here it is!

266
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,100
It's here!

267
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,840
I see.

268
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,480
I see.

269
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,920
I see.

270
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,460
I see.

271
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:37,760
I see.

272
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,200
I see.

273
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,940
I see.

274
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:39,980
I see.

275
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,020
I see.

276
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,060
I see.

277
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,080
Hey, it's only 5 seconds.

278
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,020
The deal is closed.

279
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm leaving.

280
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,680
President Nakagawa!

281
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm sorry for being late.

282
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,640
There was an accident in Stockholm.

283
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,860
No excuses.

284
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,580
Let's make sure this story never happened.

285
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,340
Yeah.

286
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,880
You only have one business chance.

287
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,760
No way!

288
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,360
President, one more chance!

289
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,980
I thought he was down, but he's already down.

290
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,860
I'm impressed.

291
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,020
You're impressed?

292
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,820
Was it my father who just got on?

293
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,680
Maybe.

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,420
I don't remember it clearly.

295
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,520
President Adam has just arrived.

296
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,320
I see.

297
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll be there in 3 minutes.

298
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,320
Come on! Come on!

299
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,660
Welcome back.

300
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,260
Thank you.

301
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,800
President Adam is waiting for you in the room on the 35th floor.

302
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,100
I see.

303
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,920
We've arrived on time.

304
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,660
This is President Nakagawa.

305
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Oh, Mr. Nakagawa!

306
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,200
I think I explained about the contract in advance.

307
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,560
I don't have time, so I'd like to ask you a quick answer.

308
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,180
Pe-la-pe-la-pe-la-pe-la-pe-la-pe-la.

309
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Pe-la-pe-la-pe-la-pe-la-pe-la.

310
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,480
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Nakagawa.

311
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,600
Please take this opportunity to...

312
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,480
I've never heard of this!

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Yes or no? Which one?

314
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,080
I-I don't know...

315
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,540
Okay.

316
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,700
It's according to the plan. Wonderful.

317
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,280
I'll sign the contract.

318
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,200
I'll leave the rest to you.

319
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,660
Yes.

320
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,520
The helicopter is here to pick you up.

321
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,920
Oh, my God!

322
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,960
Let's go!

323
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,280
Get to the next scene immediately!

324
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,340
Yes, sir!

325
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,560
Thank you for your hard work.

326
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,800
Hm, I'm a little tired.

327
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll sleep for a minute.

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,900
I'll wake you up, no matter what.

329
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,640
Yes, sir.

330
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,320
Yes.

331
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,260
We're finally here.

332
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,080
No escort right now.

333
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,280
Put the helicopter on the side.

334
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,120
Yes, sir!

335
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,700
Hey, Mr. Nakagawa!

336
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,060
Can you hear me?

337
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,460
Hm?

338
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,280
We've got five seconds left.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,700
I told you not to wake me up.

340
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,460
The helicopter was approaching without warning.

342
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,340
Hey, Mr. Nakagawa! Can you hear me?

343
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,600
Damn it!

344
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,920
The Tegane is here to see you!

345
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,500
Nakagawa, you talk too!

346
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,760
Brother!

347
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,500
Please pass the test.

348
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,900
What a guy!

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,640
If he's like this, I'll help him!

350
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,720
Hey, put the helicopter on top of it!

351
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,620
Yes, sir!

352
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,360
That's it!

353
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,420
I've got it!

354
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:11,880
Just wait!

355
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,080
What?

356
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,360
What?

357
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,900
I'm busy!

358
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,860
No!

359
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,500
Damn it!

360
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:24,980
I'll get you!

361
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,020
He jumped!

362
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,160
That's ridiculous.

363
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,560
All right!

364
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,300
Take all the parts back!

365
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,580
Hey!

366
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,140
You caught me!

367
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,700
Hey, I'm sorry for making you wait.

368
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,760
Listen to me!

369
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,160
Listen to me!

370
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,440
Then I'll give you 10 seconds.

371
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,300
Okay! Don't put your son Keiichi in the project!

372
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,580
Cancel it right now!

373
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,200
The answer is no.

374
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,300
10 seconds have passed.

375
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,740
Farewell!

376
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,680
Remember that!

377
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:56,900
Get out of here!

378
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,420
Sir, I've been waiting for you.

379
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,440
Damn it! You've prepared a car!

380
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,420
Hey! Wait!

381
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,060
Damn it!

382
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,640
Wait!

383
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,540
Who are you? Why are you so busy?

384
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,260
Ryo?

385
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,200
What? Is that Nori-chan? What's wrong?

386
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,820
I thought about it.

387
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,900
I thought I shouldn't bother Ryo anymore.

388
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,140
So I decided to give up on my life and go back to Hokkaido.

389
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,320
What? Where are you now?

390
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,320
At the airport.

391
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,540
Idiot!

392
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,540
If Nori-chan goes back, I'll quit being a policeman.

393
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,280
I'll risk my life and never let you go to the ruins!

394
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,500
Cancel the plane and wait!

395
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,600
Okay?

396
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,800
Ryo...

397
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:56,900
Uh!

398
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,620
Hey!

399
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,100
Hey!

400
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,400
I'll rent a bicycle.

401
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,340
Get out of here!

402
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,960
Sir!

403
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
I've received a call from the Brazilian ambassador.

404
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,820
As planned.

405
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
Guest Okada

406
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,380
How do you like it?

407
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,400
I see. I see.

408
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,520
I'll be there in 198 hours.

409
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:36,740
You!

410
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
I'm catching up!

411
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,700
Hey, I'm calling the police!

412
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,740
I'm the police!

413
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,560
You have to listen to me!

414
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,640
Okay, I'll give you 15 seconds.

415
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:53,800
Okay!

416
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,880
Your son didn't join the project!

417
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,620
Take Nakagawa out of the project!

418
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
The answer is no.

419
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,180
The project is already in motion!

420
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,780
Wait!

421
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,080
Nakagawa's helicopter!

422
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,600
Are you good?

423
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,640
Hey, you can't run away anymore!

424
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,740
Dad!

425
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,960
The police are here!

426
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Listen to me!

427
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,900
It's nothing.

428
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,460
It's a signal for the lunch time.

429
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,820
It will take 5 minutes.

430
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,760
Listen to me.

431
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,780
Don't be surprised!

432
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,800
I didn't think that the president would have lunch here.

433
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,000
The fastest is the best.

434
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,540
When you come to Japan, be sure to stand by.

435
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,780
You can use your cell phone.

436
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,060
Why do you need a wireless phone?

437
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,440
I don't want to be caught.

438
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,500
I'll change the frequency every time and contact you.

439
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,860
By the way, I'm Keiichi.

440
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm...

441
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,240
Excuse me.

442
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,640
Hey, are you running away?

443
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,260
I'm not very sensitive.

444
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,360
What?

445
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,620
A hotline from New York?

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,140
Here's the white rock.

447
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,540
It's like a telecommunication service.

448
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,540
My father has hated people for a long time.

449
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,760
He was always on his own.

450
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,200
So that's why you're sick.

451
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Are you living an ordinary life?

452
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
Keiichi.

453
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,960
Yes.

454
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,340
The project of the Pacific Border Road has been postponed.

455
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,200
It will start in 2098, a hundred years from now.

456
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,620
It's been decided just now.

457
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,140
Really?

458
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm glad!

459
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,020
I thought that you would quit the police!

460
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,300
Thank you, senpai!

461
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,640
Keiichi.

462
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,400
Yes?

463
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes!

464
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,980
Eh?

465
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,540
We've met for the first time in 20 years, and you've grown up so well.

466
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,220
Dad!

467
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,840
You suddenly became like your father.

468
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,540
Huh?

469
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,900
Excuse me, it's time for a drink.

470
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,540
Hey!

471
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,080
Ha!

472
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,880
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes!

473
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,780
Here it comes!

474
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,080
Hmm, I think I can work 72 hours.

475
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm sorry for causing a big fuss this time, Keiichi.

476
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,440
I want to see you and your mother slowly this time.

477
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,000
Actually, I meet my mother every year secretly.

478
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
Eh? Really?

479
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,840
Listen, this is a secret to everyone.

480
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,000
Ah, yes, I understand.

481
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,420
Even so, I'm happy to have a senior who works hard for you.

482
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,140
Yes!

483
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,380
From now on,

484
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,540
I'll be in your care, Mr. Ryotsu.

485
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,740
Yes, thank you!

486
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,720
It's time.

487
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,300
Huh?

488
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,940
Well then, goodbye!

489
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,820
Next time is 2009!

490
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,220
Until then, take care!

491
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,380
Dad, take care too!

492
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
Good luck!

493
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,440
I see, you didn't quit.

494
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,780
I'm glad, Kei-chan.

495
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,260
This is also thanks to my seniors.

496
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,760
No, I'm...

497
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,680
By the way, Nakagawa, I have something I want to ask you.

498
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,180
If there's anything I can do, please say anything.

499
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,600
Really?

500
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,960
Yes!

501
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,300
Congratulations!

502
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,540
Kei-chan, you did it!

503
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,020
Congratulations!

504
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,080
Good, Nakagawa!

505
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,620
Thank you so much, Ryotsu-chan.

506
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,680
Thank you very much!

507
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,100
I told you to leave it to me!

508
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,420
Nice to meet you, I'm Nakagawa.

509
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,640
Thank you for coming.

510
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Please continue to support the Okama Bento of the famous mountain pass.

511
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,540
Yes, thank you very much!

512
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,480
The first race of Nakagawa Bento is coming!

513
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,940
Well, welcome!

514
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,140
Welcome!

515
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,160
How about Okama Bento of the famous mountain pass?

516
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,120
Yes, I bought it!

517
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,800
Thank you very much!

518
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:20,920
Thank you very much!

519
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,320
Yes, please!

520
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:22,780
Next, please!

521
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Yes, please!

522
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,980
Welcome!

523
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,320
I look forward to working with you.

524
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,720
I thought something would happen because of you, but I didn't expect to be bought by a railroad company.

525
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,100
You are like a senior.

526
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,660
You are proud of yourself, aren't you?

527
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
You are doing your best for your friends and the station.

528
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,100
But is it okay?

529
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
You bought the Akaji Railway for 3 billion yen a year.

530
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
I have never bought it if I can be a senior.

531
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,040
Next, please!

532
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,720
Nakagawa!

533
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,920
Yes, sir!

534
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,460
Why are you looking at me?

535
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,180
Help me!

536
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,760
Yes, sir!

537
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,920
Next, please!

538
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,620
Next, please!

539
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,280
Next, please!

540
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,320
Next, please!

541
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,180
Next, please!

542
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,140
You again, Professor Ezaki!

543
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,840
You bought the Chanson, Cafe au lait, and Citroen?

544
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,920
When did you buy them in France?

545
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,980
So, I'm done with your invention!

546
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,460
Don't deceive me!

547
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,340
Listen to me!

548
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,620
Next time, "The Delusional New Invention"!
