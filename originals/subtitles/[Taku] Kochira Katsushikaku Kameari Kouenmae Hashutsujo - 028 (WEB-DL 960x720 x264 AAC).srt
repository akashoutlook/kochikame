Mommy, Your Grace

Don't think I'm worried about you

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,560
super special

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,940
The library is ranked as the top one in the first place of the library that doesn't want to be assigned even in the first place of the library.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,360
It's Ryotsu. It's all that idiot's fault.

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,320
Thanks to him, my library is ...

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,620
I understand how you feel.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,500
But if you don't stop Ryotsu, it will affect your success.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,960
No, no, my neck may be in danger as it is.

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm counting on you, Ohara.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,400
So, which one should we play today?

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,920
Ryo! Today, let's play Dorakame's ...

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,840
Nobody's here.

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,740
Strix!

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,740
Hey, you're in a pinch!

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,940
Get ready and throw!

41
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,480
I even chased you to the slough!

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,620
I knew it.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,460
I can't hear you no matter how much I try to talk to you.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
Junpei and Kappei.

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,060
Watch me. If you stop this, I will win.

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,420
Excuse me.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,440
Excuse me.

48
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,060
He's apologizing.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,460
This way, please.

50
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,140
Yes.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,320
Mr. Omawari.

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,620
I hit the guardrail by accident.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,480
You bastard!

54
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,460
You always talk to me when you're in trouble.

55
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,020
You're a loser!

56
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,460
I'm just a car.

57
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm on a break.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,220
If you come, come back later!

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,880
Yes, sir.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,540
I won't do anything more than this.

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,960
Excuse me.

63
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,000
Again.

64
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,000
Please.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,380
Yes.

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,340
Which was Kameyari Kōkaido?

67
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,760
I lost.

70
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,380
Don't be so cocky.

71
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,960
I'll go home.

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,320
Is that Kameyari Kōkai?

73
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,500
Kōkai Dō-wa?

74
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,300
You made me lose!

75
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,940
Please help me!

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,480
No way!

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:05,820
I can't lose.

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,460
We'll start the first race.

79
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,720
What's the starting point?

80
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,560
Let's start with the first race.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,560
You have a lot of personality.

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,080
Yeah, I think I'm the real deal.

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,280
Number 2, number 3, Super Scapontown.

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,680
Number 4, Karamorohirehalehario.

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,860
Chief!

86
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,040
Nice weather!

87
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,280
Ryotsu, come here.

88
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,040
Ouch!

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
It's strange that the chief doesn't yell.

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,300
He's out of his mind.

91
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,460
He's going too far.

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,920
Look at this.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,620
It was on the camera in front of the convenience store.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
It's the senior!

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,260
What's he doing?

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
No, he's just peeling off the gift seal.

97
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,480
That's not all.

98
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,160
He's at the ice cream shop.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,980
What's he doing?

100
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,200
He's looking for the ice cream stick.

101
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,220
I still have it.

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,700
He's buying bread.

103
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
What's he looking for?

104
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,260
I know! He's checking the date.

105
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,300
He's eating rotten things but he's fine.

106
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,320
He's trying to take the new thing on the date.

107
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,660
He's trying to take the new thing on the date.

108
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,020
He's panicking!

109
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,600
He's panicking!

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
He's panicking!

111
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
What's he doing?

112
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,560
That's just a mistake.

113
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,660
I can't believe it.

114
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,300
The staff was getting involved in your plan,

115
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,860
and he's now trying toель you!

116
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,960
Look at his face!

117
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,360
It's the same with the law, the game center,

118
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,660
and even the ice cream shop.

119
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,160
But exactly.

120
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,680
It's all a waste of time.

121
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,540
You're lying!

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll track his behavior from today.

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,400
I'm quick!

124
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:06,940
What?

125
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,340
3:37

126
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,960
No, Ryosan.

127
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,180
The Akiyo's anniversary was

128
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,080
perfect as you said.

129
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,700
Idiot, the Hong Kong is now on strike.

130
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,660
Darkly.

131
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm on strike.

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,620
What do you understand?

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't understand.

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,380
Oh, Ryosan.

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,580
The barbecue party in the park was interesting.

136
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,660
Let's do it again!

137
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,420
Ehhh!

138
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,300
It's not about me.

139
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,840
Not me!

140
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,640
What are you talking about?

141
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,360
Look, you gathered my friends and...

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,960
Did you make a mess in the park?

143
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,840
No, no!

144
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,620
I didn't swear!

145
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:49,860
I didn't swear!

146
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,400
I see.

147
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,160
It was the first sale of the Dora Kame 7 today.

148
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
I see.

149
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,480
What's with that face?

150
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,620
Nothing.

151
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,700
Stop it, you bad-tempered!

152
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,020
680 yen.

153
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,740
Oh, this is bad.

154
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,260
Ryosu, find it right away.

155
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,400
What?

156
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,540
Find it!

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,800
Yes, sir!

158
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,680
While we're at it, the Dora Kame will be sold out.

160
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,660
The Dora Kame...

161
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,960
The Dora Kame...

162
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,420
The Dora Kame...

163
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,200
What's the rush?

164
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,280
Oh, no.

165
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,760
The Dora Kame will be sold out.

166
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,140
The Dora Kame...

167
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm sick now.

168
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,700
I'll have to be a mountain.

169
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,640
Hey, wait, Ryosu!

170
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,900
What are you doing?

171
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,940
The Dora Kame...

172
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,720
The Dora Kame...

173
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,100
The Dora Kame...

174
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Ryosu!

175
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,260
Ryosu!

176
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,280
Wait!

177
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,260
Ow!

178
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,480
Ow!

179
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,380
Ow!

180
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
Crap.

181
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,580
Where'd he go?

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,980
Ah...

183
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,620
Huh?

184
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,740
Huh?

185
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,860
*Evil laugh*

186
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,640
*Evil laughter*

187
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:44,940
*Evil laugh*

188
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,200
*Evil laugh*

189
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,360
Ryo-chan: Ryo-chan, do you think I'll let you escape?

190
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,240
Ehh! Please let me go!

191
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,840
I'll be sold for stealing!

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
*Evil laugh*

193
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,160
So you brought him back?

194
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,340
Ryo-chan: Ryo-chan, you're the one who tried to escape to buy the new game software.

195
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,820
Ryo-chan: Ryo-chan, you're the one who tried to escape to buy the new game software.

196
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,320
If I do this, I'll have to tie a rope around my neck

197
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,480
and take him like a dog.

198
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,960
I can't manage him very much.

199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,020
Ryo-chan: But, Chief,

200
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,880
Ryo-chan: I can't manage a single human being

201
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,940
Ryo-chan: even if I try to manage him day and night.

202
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,280
Ryo-chan: I can't manage him day and night.

203
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,140
What? Who do you think I'm doing this for?

204
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,560
Ryo-chan: Who do you think I'm doing this for?

205
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,300
If you're so worried about me,

206
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
I'll make a new game software and lock you in.

207
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,200
Ryo-chan: I told you!

208
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,260
Ryo-chan: I'll make a new game software and lock you in.

209
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,120
Ryo-chan: I'll make a new game software and lock you in.

210
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,560
What?

211
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,760
This is your work place, My Home.

212
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,920
Ryo-chan: No way!

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I'll forgive you, Chief.

214
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,980
The three-sided article you're moving on is

215
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,040
my old and old work.

216
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,400
Ryo-chan: Let me out! I don't like this place!

217
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,380
Ryo-chan: There's no game, no pro model, no TV!

218
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,760
There's no game, no pro model, no TV!

219
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,080
You can't break it with just a shake.

220
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,300
Ryo-chan: Damn it! Remember this!

221
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,960
Ryo-chan: I'll get out of here for sure!

222
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,540
Hmm?

223
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,120
...

224
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,460
Ryo-chan: Watch me.

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,280
Since I don't have any sense...

226
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,440
嚼

227
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,080
That's not going to work!

228
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
What's wrong?

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,180
You're suddenly getting heavier!

230
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,440
You're something big, Ryotsu.

231
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:52,760
Uh?

232
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,160
You can't have any unnecessary resistance, Ryotsu!

233
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,600
Where did you get this?

234
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
I'll keep it.

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,980
We're still on the move.

236
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,980
I'll get you out of here.

237
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll get you out of here.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,540
I don't have a TV, radio, or manga.

239
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,780
I clean up my desk during the day.

240
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,520
I do my homework during the night.

241
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,860
I don't have a job.

242
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,360
I use the hardest wood.

243
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,760
I use the hardest wood.

244
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,160
It takes a year to pick it up with my teeth.

245
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,180
I need to get some tools to escape.

246
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,740
I need to get some tools to escape.

247
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,620
I need to get some tools to escape.

248
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:13,980
I need a T-shirt.

249
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,080
I need a T-shirt.

250
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,320
I need a kit.

251
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,520
I need a kit set.

252
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,580
I need a cap.

253
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,040
I need a winter hat.

254
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,080
I need a мед kit set.

255
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,620
Damn you!

256
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,420
I did it!

257
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,120
You idiot!

258
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,440
This time!

259
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,800
All right!

260
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,480
What's going on?

261
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm...

262
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm...

263
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm...

264
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,500
Huh?

265
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,540
Huh?

266
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,960
Huh?

267
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,140
Here.

268
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,680
Thank you.

269
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,580
You've worked hard.

270
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,760
I know.

271
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
Where's the game cassette?

272
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,140
I know.

273
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,560
Here.

274
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:25,920
Yay!

275
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,020
By the way, did you play Dragon Ball?

276
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,120
Nice.

277
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,500
If you succeed in escaping, come to my house.

278
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,600
I'll let you play.

279
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,460
Really?

280
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah.

281
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,380
Okay, wait.

282
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,700
I'll definitely go.

283
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,120
Both of them have reflected on themselves a little.

284
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,640
How about it?

285
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,560
It seems that they are quiet.

286
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,200
Okay, let's escape.

287
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,020
Escape from the graphics paradise.

288
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm not familiar with it.

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
That room is brothers.

290
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,460
Oh, what is it?

291
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,380
What's that?

292
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,760
What the,flower?

293
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,220
What is it?

294
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
What do we do ?

295
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,540
This is a puedes.

296
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,240
Oh, this is too hard.

297
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, no.

298
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,840
This is too much.

299
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,000
A flower,

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,540
Oh, my God !

301
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,200
Isn't it cute ?

302
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Chief, what's wrong?

303
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,380
It can't be!

304
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,360
Ryotsu!

305
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,240
You're here.

306
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,280
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

307
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,860
That's right.

308
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,100
What do you think, Ryotsu?

309
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,540
Sitting there, you'll get used to the stupidity of the past.

310
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,600
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

311
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,380
All right. I'll keep working hard.

312
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
As expected of Ryotsu, this time he was pretty good.

313
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
He's been reflecting on his stupidity.

314
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
That's not the kind of ball he's got.

315
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,560
Tenai, give me the key.

316
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,120
Yes, sir.

317
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,560
Hey, Ryotsu!

318
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,280
What are you up to?

319
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

320
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

321
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

322
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

323
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,220
Chief, Chief. I'm sorry.

324
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,060
I'm sorry, Chief.

325
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,800
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

327
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,840
I'm sorry, Chief.

329
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,800
Oh,

330
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,380
The

331
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,280
Do you think I'm

332
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,980
I'm sure.

333
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,740
Oh,

334
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,220
That's his way of trying to catch an enemy.

335
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,860
What are you waiting for, Ryotsu?

336
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,740
Right there!

337
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,420
What's that?

338
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,980
Damn, that was close.

339
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,520
How's that, Ryotsu?

340
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,960
This Yushi-Tetsu line is covered with a lot of bugs all over the ceiling.

341
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,440
And...

342
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,740
As you can see, the Yushi-Tetsu line is under high voltage.

343
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,300
How's that, Ryotsu?

344
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,500
I can't believe you've done this.

345
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,900
This is the last resort.

346
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,500
Ryotsu!

347
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,000
How's Ryotsu doing?

348
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,680
He seems to be doing well.

349
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,960
I see.

350
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,400
There's no way he's going to run away again.

351
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,760
But don't be careless.

352
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm sure Harry will be able to get out of the tunnel soon.

353
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,620
Oh, come on, Ryota.

354
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,260
I saw you carry one for the

355
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,740
Did you hear some strange noise?

356
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,480
Strange noise?

357
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,140
Maybe it's me just imagining things.

358
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,460
Still weird.

359
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,220
He's moving in.

360
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,100
Providers are still inside!

361
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,080
Huh? Why is that floor is floating up like that?

362
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,060
Don't do that!

363
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,160
Don't jump!

364
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,260
Jump! Jump! Jump!

365
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,080
Jump! Jump! Jump!

366
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,580
Don't jump!

367
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,500
Get off!

368
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:49,860
Stop!

369
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,160
I heard a strange sound.

370
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,040
I heard a strange sound.

371
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,460
It's a dragon!

372
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,860
What's going on?

373
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,280
Is it Ryo-tsu?

374
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,260
This is bad!

375
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,280
Ryo-tsu, are you doing something?

376
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,860
Ryo-tsu, are you doing something?

377
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,580
I can feel your heart.

378
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,120
What's with that outfit?

379
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm too hot, so I'm wearing a jacket.

380
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm too hot, so I'm wearing a jacket.

381
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,360
What about your helmet?

382
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm wearing a jacket.

383
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm wearing a jacket.

384
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,680
What about your rope?

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,880
This is a fashion.

386
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,620
This is a fashion.

387
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,380
The first tunnel, Harry,

388
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,080
is no longer repairable.

389
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,600
The second tunnel, Tom,

390
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,680
is no longer repairable.

391
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,800
I'll continue to dig at night.

392
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,520
I'll continue to dig at night.

393
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,200
I'll continue to dig at night.

394
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,820
I will introduce it.

395
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,340
You're just sitting in the tunnel.

396
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,900
I will introduce it.

397
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,860
Here's the shield gun.

398
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,100
Here's the shield gun.

399
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,920
That?

400
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Don't!

401
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Don't!

402
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,600
It's strange.

403
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,660
What the...

404
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,880
What the hell...

405
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,520
This is bad...

406
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,060
What the hell...

407
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,560
*Turbulence*

408
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,260
*Turbulence*

409
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,020
*Turbulence*

410
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,940
*Turbulence*

411
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,440
*Turbulence*

412
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,720
This is good.

413
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,360
But I can't go straight ahead like this.

414
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,200
*Turbulence*

415
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,700
Alright, this way.

416
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,180
*Turbulence*

417
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,640
*Turbulence*

418
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,820
*Turbulence*

419
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,860
*Turbulence*

420
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,520
*Turbulence*

421
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,840
Ah...

422
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,640
Oh, the sewer?

423
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,400
Well, I'll take it.

424
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,720
*Turbulence*

425
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,820
*Turbulence*

426
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,360
*Turbulence*

427
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,660
*Turbulence*

428
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,380
*Turbulence*

429
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,840
*Turbulence*

430
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,340
*Turbulence*

431
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,480
*Drum roll*

432
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,640
*Drum roll*

433
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,920
*Drum roll*

434
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,340
*Drum roll*

435
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,740
*Drum roll*

436
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,320
*Drum roll*

437
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,780
*Drum roll*

438
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,580
*Drum roll*

439
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,740
*Drum roll*

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,300
*Drum roll*

442
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,800
*Drum roll*

443
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,200
*Drum roll*

444
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,240
*Drum roll*

445
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,980
*Drum roll*

446
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,780
*Drum roll*

447
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,960
*Drum roll*

448
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,340
*Drum roll*

449
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,120
*Drum roll*

450
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,420
*Drum roll*

451
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,580
*Drum roll*

452
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,780
*Drum roll*

453
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,500
*Drum roll*

454
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,640
*Drum roll*

455
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,860
*Drum roll*

456
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:05,980
*Drum roll*

457
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
*Drum roll*

458
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,060
*Drum roll*

459
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,420
*Drum roll*

460
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,780
*Drum roll*

461
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,820
*Drum roll*

462
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,200
*Drum roll*

463
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,620
*Drum roll*

464
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,340
*Drum roll*

465
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:15,420
*Drum roll*

466
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,100
*Drum roll*

467
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,940
*Drum roll*

468
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,500
*Drum roll*

469
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,580
*Drum roll*

470
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,020
That's right!

471
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,360
This won't work.

472
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,060
It must be Ryosu's trick.

473
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,360
Hehehe, that's right.

474
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,000
Ryosu, you bastard!

475
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,100
Yes!

476
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,220
Ta-dah!

477
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
On your right hand, there are 100 cockroaches.

478
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,380
100 bees

479
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,200
100 honey bees

480
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,460
100 honey bees

481
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,400
100 honey bees

482
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,780
Which do you want?

483
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,100
Where did you get all these?

484
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,520
Stop being stupid!

485
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,720
Oh, you want both?

486
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,700
Then I'll take both!

487
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,080
Then I'll take both!

488
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,180
Aaaaah!

489
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,860
Aaaaah!

490
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,200
Aaaaah!

491
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,580
Aaaaah!

492
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,820
Aaaaah!

493
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,040
Aaaaah!

494
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,960
Aaaaah!

495
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,140
Aaaaah!

496
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,260
Aaaaah!

497
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,100
Aaaaah!

498
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,520
You want to go in my hand?

499
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,500
I'm not going to let you take me.

500
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,460
Aaaaah!

501
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,580
Oh, no!

502
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,940
I caught you!

503
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,320
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

504
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,780
The emergency line is behind you!

505
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,680
The emergency line is behind you!

506
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,500
The emergency line is behind you!

507
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,760
The emergency line is behind you!

508
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,960
I wonder if Ohara-kun is doing well.

509
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,880
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

510
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,540
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

511
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
Don't stab me!

512
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
Ouch! Ouch!

513
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,040
Help me, sir!

514
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,620
You're so funny!

515
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,600
I'm serious!

516
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,200
I was saved because of the hole you made.

517
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,040
Really?

518
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,160
Damn it!

519
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,400
I was alone there.

520
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,280
Ouch! Ouch!

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,860
Ohara-kun, what are you doing?

522
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,620
What?

523
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,400
First President,

524
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,400
This is a fire training,

525
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,620
Er...

526
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,260
Ouch!

527
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,300
Help me!

528
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,160
Hey, chief! I'm begging you, please!

529
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,400
Ohara-kun...

530
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,980
Ha!

531
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,640
Let's pretend that this exit was never there.

532
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,740
Hey, I'm alive!

533
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,200
S.O.S. S.O.S.

534
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,720
Chief!

535
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,100
No, S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-No-Fans-No-Truth-okay?

536
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,900
No-Fans-No-Truth-Okay?

537
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Thanks for breaking my random car!

538
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,640
It took me 100,000 yen to�do this!

539
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm being useless to the police!

540
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,420
I'll have to take responsibility!

541
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,020
Next, "A stag-potato-omelette time!"

542
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,820
See ya!

543
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,700
Today, there's only 5 hours until the 도 cream.

544
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:36,200
Even if I try to stop the clock, time will pass

545
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:47,220
Don't stare at me, laugh and live

546
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:57,460
Let's live, even if it rains today

547
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,300
Tomorrow will be sunny

548
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,620
Bye bye, let's wash our hands

549
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
Goodbye, the unpleasant things

550
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,300
Oh yeah

551
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,500
Oh yeah

552
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,960
Let's live as we like

553
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,400
There is something good

554
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,660
Outside the door, the sun is calling
