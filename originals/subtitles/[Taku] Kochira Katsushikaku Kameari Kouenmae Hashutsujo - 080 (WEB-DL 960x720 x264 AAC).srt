2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,920
At the moment I look inside,

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,080
An imaginary sun is shining

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,520
When I kick a petal,

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,140
Even my shoes fly.

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,900
From the last of my crowned hat

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,780
To your anyhow

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,140
The sun is setting

9
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,460
This tomorrow is already ended

10
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,960
'Cause I've lost my happiness and once again

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,680
Because I'm an idiot

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,280
Hanazaka Ryo

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,200
Ryo-tsuu!

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,440
What's the matter, chief?

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,840
What the hell is this?

16
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,240
Huh? Isn't this the test paper I submitted yesterday?

17
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,220
I can't feel any regret at all.

18
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,020
Thanks to you, I've been warned by the chief.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,300
Is that so? I thought you were really good at it.

20
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,160
Where in this ridiculous world are you good at?

21
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,700
You're just as dirty as ever.

22
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,860
Write your own name in kanji.

23
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,880
Shut up! Thank you very much.

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,220
Well, I've been working in Kameari, Katsushikaku, for 10 years.

25
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,720
I've been working without pay,

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,580
and I've been secretly taking a patrol car.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
I've broken three road traffic laws,

28
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,980
and I've been forced to do it.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,820
My colleague Nakagawa is going to go to the sea,

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
so I'm trying to stop him.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,680
I-I didn't say that!

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,360
I'll be busy with my work from now on,

33
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,200
and I'll never do such a thing again, so forgive me.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,260
No, I mean, forgive me for being so rude.

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,220
See? I'm good, right?

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,840
I don't think you're really regretting it.

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,220
I'll make it worse from the second one.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,320
Well,

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
I'll write down the following.

40
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,980
This one too.

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,160
This one too.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
Who's going to write the following in the police station?

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,080
The chief is so angry that he's getting bored.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,700
There's no way I can do that.

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,000
The chief has a narrow mind

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,200
that can't understand humor.

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,360
Okay, we're done.

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,380
What do you think of this popular street model?

49
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,480
Oh, it's wooden!

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,080
Huh?

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,180
Idiot!

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,500
It's not the time to make this during my work!

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,580
I've rewritten the entire death certificate!

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
Damn it, chief.

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,980
It took me a whole day to rewrite the death certificate.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,420
Huh?

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,600
What's that?

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,000
100,000 yen.

59
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,740
If I didn't buy this old man's book,

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
I could've bought the wooden one.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,080
Chief!

62
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,320
R-Ryotsu!

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,260
What are you doing?

64
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,300
Did you rewrite the death certificate?

65
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,840
No, I didn't.

66
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,800
I finished it.

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,780
Chief, what do you think of toys?

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Huh?

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,720
What?

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
You're going to buy 100,000 yen for this?

71
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,720
What a crappy business!

72
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,600
You think so too, right?

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,720
Actually,

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,940
it's Daesuke's birthday the day after tomorrow.

75
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,360
Oh, is that so?

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
Yes, that's right.

77
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,980
So I got a wooden stick as a present,

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,240
but I don't have it.

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,480
I didn't expect you to pay 100,000 yen.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
Hmm, that's a good thing.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,580
It's a chance to rewrite the death certificate.

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,600
How much is the budget, chief?

83
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,740
Huh?

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,140
About 30,000 yen.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,940
I got it!

86
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,360
I'll accept that 30,000 yen.

87
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,100
What?

88
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,020
I'll make a completely different,

89
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,080
no, a more splendid wooden stick.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,660
After all, I'm a master of toy making.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Oh, you are?

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,300
No, it's not a bad thing to ask you.

93
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,320
I'll give up on it and make another one.

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Chief!

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,260
You don't care about Daesuke's future, do you?

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,040
What do you mean?

97
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,980
Humans,

98
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,440
from 1 to 3 years old,

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,500
are much more dependent on education.

100
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,940
Are you sure, chief?

101
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,700
Education is good for your body.

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,040
For example,

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
you say classical music is good for your senses.

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,120
Well, that's true.

105
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,400
That's true for toys.

106
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,180
Plastic toys are good for the body,

107
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,060
but they are not good for children.

108
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,620
Hmm, I see.

109
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,920
Toys are made of wood.

110
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,820
The gentle touch of the wood

111
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,300
affects the mind.

112
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,540
You can't say that.

113
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,120
Daesuke's future depends on this stick.

114
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,700
I got it, Ryotsu.

115
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,820
I'll take it for 30,000 yen.

116
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,000
W-what?

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,460
You don't call people to ask for things.

118
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,060
You usually ask for three.

119
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,160
I-I see.

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,340
I'll take it for 30,000 yen, Ryotsu.

121
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,240
I can't hear you.

122
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,780
I'm sorry for Daesuke,

123
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,520
I-I'm sorry.

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,240
Please,

125
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
I'll take it this way, Ryotsu.

126
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,960
You should ask for it from the beginning.

127
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,340
Right, Ohara?

128
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,420
O-Ohara?

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,540
What's wrong with your face?

130
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,960
Are you going to quit?

131
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,220
No, I'm sorry.

132
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
Please, Ryotsu.

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,420
All right.

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,060
I'll go get the materials.

135
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,420
I think I made the wrong choice.

136
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,300
I wonder if he's doing it right.

137
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,620
Hmm...

138
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,840
Ryotsu, are you working on it?

139
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,540
Ah!

140
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh.

141
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,640
I-I'm sorry, Ryotsu.

142
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,360
How are you?

143
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm good.

144
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,780
I-I see.

145
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,040
You can do it.

146
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,280
Chief, wouldn't it be bad to make a nice kitchen for Daisuke no matter how much he loves it?

147
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,540
That's true.

148
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,040
Ryotsu! No, Mr. Ryotsu!

149
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,340
There is a public service, so I don't think you can make it in the break room.

150
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,040
I see. Then please take all the things here to the break room, Mr. Ohara.

151
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,060
What did you say?

152
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,760
I remembered something. Go home.

153
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,680
Oh, wait! I understand! I'll take it, so please don't go home, Mr. Ryotsu!

154
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,760
Call me "master"!

155
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,300
Please don't go home, Mr. Ryotsu!

156
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,740
I can't help it. Then please take me home, Mr. Ohara.

157
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,240
By the way, it's lunchtime soon. I want to eat eel.

158
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,120
If you don't let me eat it, I'll go home.

159
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,180
Nakagawa, please order eel.

160
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,200
Yes.

161
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,440
It's the eel from Izue, Ueno.

162
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,360
It's too far away. It doesn't matter which one you eat.

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,740
It doesn't matter.

164
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,360
Goodbye.

165
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,440
Wait! I'll order it.

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,380
It was delicious! I just wanted to take it by car.

167
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,160
Good job! If it's done, I won't leave it for free.

168
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,560
It seems to be crowded.

169
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,060
It's for children, so it's dangerous if the corners are sharp.

170
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,340
As expected. No matter what you say, you don't miss your work.

171
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Teacher, your tea is ready.

172
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,140
Please enjoy it until it cools down.

173
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,140
Yes.

174
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,900
Do you want to rub my shoulders?

175
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,360
Ryotsu!

176
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,020
Jiro!

177
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,980
No, I meant Ryofu.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,540
It must be too hot. I'll go home.

179
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,080
Teacher, please let me rub your shoulders.

180
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,160
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
You've completely reversed your position.

182
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm sure Senpai is more advantageous this time.

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,520
Oh, it's done.

184
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,620
Wow, it's great.

185
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
It looks more luxurious than the wooden platter in the toy shop.

186
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
As expected of Ryo-chan.

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760
Daisuke-kun will be happy.

188
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,220
Sir, I also installed the bonus function.

189
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,580
Bonus function?

190
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,180
Please try to climb.

191
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,240
Like this?

192
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,960
I hear a sound of a hedgehog.

193
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,360
Please pull the horn.

194
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,140
Wonderful.

195
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,880
I can hear a real horse.

196
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,320
It will be a good education.

197
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,320
It will sell for 100,000 yen.

198
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
It still has a great function.

199
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,340
Sir, please try to knock down the wooden platter.

200
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,820
Now, let's do our best to enter the fourth corner.

201
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,300
I will be misunderstood by the far away horse.

202
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
I will begin to twist the magic wheel at once.

203
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
What's this?

204
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,160
A live broadcast of the field race?

205
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,000
Lazy!

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,340
If Daisuke becomes a gambler like you, what will we do?

207
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,320
I will break the device without the machine.

208
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Well, I knew you wanted to do it.

209
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,460
I understood.

210
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,000
It's done.

211
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,180
That's good, sir.

212
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,060
Yes.

213
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,780
I can see Daishke's happy face.

214
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,160
Sir.

215
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,820
Yes?

216
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,300
Pay for this.

217
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,820
What is this?

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
I ordered sushi from the sushi restaurant for dinner last night.

219
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,980
What?

220
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,120
If you don't pay, I won't let you have it.

221
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,420
If you bring it, you'll get more than 50,000 yen.

222
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
I see.

223
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll pay, right?

224
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,100
Good luck.

225
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm sorry to interrupt you today.

226
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,180
I'll pay for it.

227
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,400
Damn you, Ryotsu.

228
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,020
I'll make you pay for this.

229
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,820
Good morning.

230
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,700
Good morning, Ryo.

231
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,760
Good morning.

232
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,040
You've grown a lot.

233
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,020
I know.

234
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,680
I've been taking care of the eggs I bought.

235
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,600
I've been taking care of them.

236
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,300
What are you doing?

237
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,420
I brought the orchids you grew at home.

238
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,540
Orchids?

239
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,140
They're small.

240
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
It looks like they're lined up with rotten dumplings.

241
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,860
You don't have to look at them.

242
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,560
Yes, yes, I don't have to look at them.

243
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,220
Senpai, this orchid is a high-class flower.

244
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,760
It's expensive.

245
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,500
How much will it cost?

246
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,780
If I buy it, I'll pay 30,000 yen.

247
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
What? 30,000 yen?

248
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,460
30,000 yen for such a dumpling flower?

249
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,600
I can't believe it.

250
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,640
It's only 30,000 yen for a single leaf.

251
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,440
That means it's the same price as the wood I made over the past two days.

252
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,340
It's the same price as the work I worked hard on over the past two days.

253
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm so frustrated.

254
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,620
You don't have to cry.

255
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,300
You saw it, didn't you?

256
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,200
The wood I made.

257
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,340
It's a work of art.

258
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,400
It's a work of art.

259
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
It was a wonderful work.

260
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,080
I know.

261
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
It's a plant that grew from such a garden.

262
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
So it's the same as the grass or flower that grew on its own.

263
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,500
The world is wrong.

264
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,380
My work is better.

265
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,900
This orchid is a wonderful work.

266
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,780
What?

267
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,780
Well, senpai.

268
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,260
Gardening is popular these days.

269
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
What's with the cleaning relatives?

270
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,620
It's about growing grass flowers at home.

271
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,220
Nonsense.

272
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,680
Flowers are for sacrifice.

273
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,760
There's no need for such a high flower.

274
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,620
If the price is the same, I'd be happy to get melons.

275
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,800
You're so noisy.

276
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,120
Shut up!

277
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,780
I won't listen to anyone.

278
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,720
I don't want to sell that kind of thing.

279
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,980
Wait a minute.

280
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,380
30,000 yen per box.

281
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,860
300,000 yen for 10 pots.

282
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,520
3 million yen for 100 pots.

283
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,340
If you can make it at the manager's house, I can make it, too.

284
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,860
This may be a good story.

285
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
The End

286
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,420
The End

287
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,060
I can make flowers bloom many times depending on how I grow them.

288
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,080
If you raise them as carefully as the manager, they'll bloom.

289
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,760
Well, yes.

290
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,360
Well, manager.

291
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
What?

292
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,460
What?

293
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,840
How many flowers are there in the manager's house?

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,160
About 20 pots.

295
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
20 pots?

296
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,280
That means 600,000 yen.

297
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,360
It's a lot of money.

298
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,100
Manager, where do you sell these flowers?

299
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,240
What?

300
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,100
I said it was useless.

301
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,940
What's wrong with you?

302
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,500
Well, it's a wonderful flower.

303
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,240
Beautiful.

304
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,260
What?

305
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,920
You're a bad guy.

306
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,020
No, I was impressed by the fact that I was late and the scales fell off my eyes.

307
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Really, gardening is a great hobby.

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,380
It's gardening.

309
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
It's similar.

310
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,720
Where?

311
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,320
Hey, manager.

312
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,540
Leave that aside.

313
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,640
I want to enjoy the joy of raising flowers like you.

314
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,340
Please teach me.

315
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,900
Then, I'll take a note of my acquaintance's art store.

316
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,600
I'll take a note of my acquaintance's art store.

317
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
Something's strange.

318
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,940
I feel like I'm planning something.

319
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,440
I feel like I'm planning something.

320
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:30,860
I feel like I'm planning something.

321
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,460
You're good, Takuya-kun.

322
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,280
How are you?

323
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Masahiro-kun, Goro-kun, Tsuyoshikun, Shingo-kun, Namie-chan, Ryoko-chan, Yuko-chan, how are you all doing?

324
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,040
I came to give you food.

325
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,880
Eat a lot and you'll become a good adult.

326
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Tomoya-kun, you're good.

327
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,360
Yes, you're a great man.

328
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,780
Ame-chan, Yumiko-chan, let's draw a line with Tamiyo all right?

329
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,740
I got a suggestion from Reiko-chan.

330
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,600
If you talk to the flowers every day, they will grow faster.

331
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,980
I advised him to make them a hundred times faster.

332
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,380
But he named all of them "A"

333
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,240
I don't think it's a good idea to buy so many of them.

334
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,240
It's only after he learned that orchids are expensive flowers.

335
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,660
He's completely going to make them a business.

336
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,480
Chief, how much temperature do you need to keep the greenhouse?

337
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Now it's about 15 degrees.

338
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,180
15 degrees...

339
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,540
Maybe it's better to cover it with a sun-dryer.

340
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,100
I think it's better to do it now.

341
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,120
I bought a Sumition and a Kelsen to keep the insects away.

342
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,620
Do you need anything else?

343
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,940
That's fine.

344
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,940
Thank you.

345
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,260
He's a good guy.

346
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,560
He's been doing a lot of research.

347
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,260
Senpai, if it's for money, people change.

348
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,720
Chief!

349
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,200
Don't suddenly show your face.

350
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,560
I was talking about the share price.

352
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,720
He suddenly became a low-ranking student.

353
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,020
That's right.

354
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,080
He was a student

355
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,280
Let's pay him back.

356
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,520
Chief, didn't you hear?

357
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,940
It's a share price.

358
00:15:59,420 --> 00:15:59,980
What?

359
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,820
Share price?

360
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,460
That's an important point.

361
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,300
Right?

362
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,780
What are you going to do to do it well?

363
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,600
My shoulders are stiff.

364
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,560
What?

365
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,880
Damn it.

366
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,260
Are you going to take the revenge the other day?

367
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,500
I want someone to rub it.

368
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,820
It's stiff.

369
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,940
Sorry, Ryozu.

370
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,880
I want you to rub my shoulders.

371
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,280
No, it's nothing.

372
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,420
It's nothing.

373
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,380
What are you going to do about the share price?

374
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,200
If you don't do well, you'll hurt your roots.

375
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,980
It's hard.

376
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,660
So please tell me how to do it.

377
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm home.

378
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,340
Ryo, you came here on a day off?

379
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,180
There's a ceremony.

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,880
Chief, I bought a new cup of tea.

381
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,020
I see.

382
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
Let's drink together.

383
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,380
Ryozu said he'd put it in for everyone.

384
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm on a day off.

385
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,160
Why do I have to put it in?

386
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm not going to do it alone.

387
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,600
Don't you want to get advice?

388
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,580
It's okay.

389
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll do it myself.

390
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,380
Really?

391
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,840
Then do your best.

392
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,740
Ryo is weak to diseases.

393
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,680
Be careful.

394
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,320
There's a case where he was wiped out overnight.

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,800
What?

396
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,020
Chief, don't say it.

397
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,400
Please tell me.

398
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,500
Damn it.

399
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,380
He's obsessed with the weakness of people.

400
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,660
It's about lunchtime.

401
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,400
Do you all want to eat sushi?

402
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Sounds good.

403
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,120
I just got paid, so I'll have a luxury time.

404
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,540
No, no.

405
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,600
Even if you don't pay yourself, Ryozu will pay you.

406
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,060
I knew it.

407
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,660
Chief, no way.

408
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,420
If you don't like it, I'll teach you how to cut the stock.

409
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,960
Damn it.

410
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,700
This is overwhelmingly bad.

411
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,540
Please give me four special rice balls.

412
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,000
That's right.

413
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,580
Would you like Ueno's Matsuzushi?

414
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,100
That far away?

415
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,160
Yes.

416
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,380
Thank you.

417
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,720
Thanks.

418
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,080
I'll take your hot springs.

419
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,000
Listen to the good music and grow high.

420
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,340
Excuse me.

421
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,880
.

422
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,080
Please take the ball.

423
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,080
You guys!

424
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,760
Don't play baseball in the park!

425
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
Shinji and Naomi's pot broke!

426
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,180
Don't say that!

427
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,420
Shut up!

428
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,760
Don't play with Ryutaro and Takako!

429
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,160
Wait, you!

430
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,360
Hey!

431
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,240
Now it's the crows!

432
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,500
Don't eat Yukio and Naoto!

433
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,060
Go over there!

434
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,660
Now I can protect you 24/7!

435
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,020
Senpai, how about staying at the police station at night?

436
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,360
No! Gardening is a battle!

437
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,460
It's a battle!

438
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
It's a battle!

439
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,800
Richiro, good!

440
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,260
Hideki, good!

441
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,580
Nomo, good!

442
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,420
Pae-chan, good!

443
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,160
Ai-chan, good!

444
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,940
Tomoko, good!

445
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,820
Yukio!

446
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,260
Huh?

447
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,880
Yukio got eaten without knowing it.

448
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,960
It's good that you're so enthusiastic,

449
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,940
but I wonder if your body will last until your flowers bloom.

450
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm risking my life, senpai.

451
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,200
What?

452
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,280
What are we doing?

453
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,940
Sorry, I got lost.

454
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,020
Don't run all the time in the city!

455
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,560
Lee-Lee!

456
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,660
@lorenz is in danger!

457
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,560
@geun!

458
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,340
@Top Gun-kun, @Michael-kun, @Jo-kun-kun!

459
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Hiiii!

460
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,360
Sh*t, it's Tatsumaki!

461
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
Great success, Gabriel!

462
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,300
Please take my cute children with you!

463
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,840
It bloomed!

464
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,280
I didn't know that 50 flowers could bloom.

465
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,220
It's beautiful!

466
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,620
Senpai, you did your best.

467
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,220
All right! Let's see how much it will cost!

468
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,100
It's wonderful.

469
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
It's been a long time since I saw such a beautiful flower.

470
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,840
How much is a pot?

471
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,880
It's about 50,000 yen.

472
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,360
50,000 yen?

473
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,060
Really?

474
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,420
That means it's 2.5 million yen for 58 flowers!

475
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,340
Oh, I almost forgot.

476
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,400
What's wrong?

477
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,020
Look at this.

478
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,820
What?

479
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,500
It's purple.

480
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,440
What's wrong with this?

481
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,880
It can be pink or red, but purple is rare.

482
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
I'll give you 500,000 yen, no, 1 million yen.

483
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,300
You're a bear!

484
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,000
What a parent-child relationship!

485
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,420
There might be others.

486
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,420
Lend me some.

487
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,980
There it is!

488
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,480
It's purple, too!

489
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,660
It's 2 million yen for a bear.

490
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,300
That's great!

491
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,340
Hey, blue doesn't work.

492
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,820
What?

493
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,040
A blue?

494
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,960
It's a miracle!

495
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,300
It's so beautiful!

496
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,060
It's hard to make a blue flower, even though it's a rose.

497
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,640
It's 500,000 yen for this.

498
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,280
No, even if you pay 10 million yen, there are people who want it.

499
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,660
10 million yen?

500
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Jugemu, Jugemu, Gokou's three-chopped!

501
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,860
That's a long name just for you!

502
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,420
I'm so happy!

503
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,220
Ryotsu, tomorrow the Lan's competition is held at the Kuritsu Plantation.

504
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,980
It will be held at the Kuritsu Plantation.

505
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,680
You should all bring it there.

506
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,740
If you win, you might get a higher price.

507
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
Okay, I got it!

508
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,240
50 bars is a lot of money.

509
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,820
I'll take a break.

510
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,300
I just got it checked, and it's 15 million yen.

511
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,220
If I put a whiteboard on this, it's 30 million yen.

512
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
No, it'll be about 50 million yen.

513
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,880
This is all thanks to you guys.

514
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm good at acting.

515
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,180
I'll stop being a cop and start working here.

516
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,440
Go!

517
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,600
Oh, no!

518
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,120
Don't move!

519
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,540
Jugemu, Jugemu, Gokou's three-chopped!

520
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,440
Nice!

521
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,900
Okay, everyone, I'll help you!

522
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,620
Stop the rear car in front of you!

523
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,360
Go!

524
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,400
No!

525
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,080
I'll protect you even if I die!

526
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,960
I did it!

527
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,140
Oh, no!

528
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,080
So this is the Lan that costs 20 million yen.

529
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,640
Apparently, Marie Antoinette took over the Lan that she loved.

530
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,500
Oh, no!

531
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,740
I'll take my revenge!

532
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,640
I'll do something to their

533
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,080
What's the matter?

534
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,220
May I have your attention, please?

535
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,780
Sir, is that you?

536
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,480
Yes.

537
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,760
Oh, no!

538
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,640
Don't get involved, Okura-kun.

539
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,200
Let's go!

540
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,940
Nyaa! Please wait!

541
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,660
You'll be compensated for that!

542
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,000
T-that was an accident!

543
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,480
Chief!

544
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,520
I don't care!

545
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,640
You do something yourself!

546
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,480
That Volvo Saigo is going to work at the Katushika office.

547
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,620
