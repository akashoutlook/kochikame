1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,340
The End

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,600
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,620
Keep your room light and keep your distance

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:25,240
It's like someone is calling

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,200
After the rain

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,180
I walked with a look back

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,500
I reached out to my mom

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,360
I felt

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,440
A strange feeling

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,940
So I tried walking on the red and black tiles

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:55,060
I tried walking on the red and black tiles

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,320
Everybody was once child

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,840
But, they all forget

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,320
The politician with a proud face

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,740
and the blue lady with blue eyes

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,320
Turn around

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,020
That corner

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,820
You will meet everyone

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,020
There is a wall

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,480
Kameari

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,720
Ah, Kitto Kameari

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone, come to our town

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you!

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,500
Double Date in Hell

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,680
Double Date in Hell

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,700
As expected from Borobo, what a great defense

27
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,500
Happy Birthday, Bobby

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,420
Happy Birthday

29
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,300
Congratulations, Bobby

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,900
Everyone came here for me?

31
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,380
Thank you, thank you so much

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,840
That was last year's birthday

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,540
What a ugly birthday

34
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,440
It's pretty grand

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,640
Yeah

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
This year's birthday is...

37
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,320
I wish I could spend it with pleasure like that

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,680
Shoro!

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,580
It's an explosion!

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,460
What's that?

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,200
Is it a bomb?

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
It's a communication capsule

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,200
It's for Borobo

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,780
There's no way to communicate like that

45
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,180
Your friends are all ugly

46
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh, this is from Jody

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,420
What? From Jody?

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,400
So, what does it say?

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,940
Ah...

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,460
Um...

51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,820
Hi, Bobby

52
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,220
Next week is your birthday

53
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,220
Take a break and go to Japan

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,320
Of course, I won't tell my dad

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,900
We'll spend a wonderful day together

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,560
Your Jody

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,360
It's an invitation to a date!

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,700
If it's just the two of us...

59
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,440
...we'll leave it to you

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,640
I thought you were asking for a date

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:05,120
There's no need

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah, I guess

63
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,780
I'm sorry

64
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,120
I'm just saying

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,180
But you should

66
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,980
How about you?

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm not worried

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,680
I'll always be your friend

69
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:18,780
I see.

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,520
Have you ever spent your birthday with only her?

71
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,340
Sorry, I didn't mean to ask you.

72
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,760
You bastard.

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,300
You didn't have a girl until last year!

74
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:48,840
S-Someone! Someone save me!

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,140
What?

76
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,560
Barba!

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,340
Wait!

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,520
No one's coming to save you.

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,580
You're so stubborn.

80
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,880
Wait!

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
As expected of you, Bulba.

82
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,180
I didn't have a chance to come out.

83
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,060
Are you hurt?

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,500
Thanks.

85
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,620
Thanks for saving me.

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,980
Maria!

87
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,160
Cut! Cut! Cut!

88
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,160
You're in trouble!

89
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,260
This scene is too much!

90
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,820
Was it a movie?

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Movie?

92
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,960
Why did Maria go to the movies?

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,620
No!

94
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,680
It wasn't me.

95
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,000
What?

96
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,920
M-Maria went to the movies with two...

97
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,700
That's Marilyn.

98
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,740
She's a big star in Hong Kong.

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,180
Her real name is Asatrin.

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,560
She's my twin sister.

101
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Sister?

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,500
An actress?

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes.

104
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,160
You defeated the best fighters in Hong Kong.

105
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,940
I love strong people.

106
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,580
Sister?

107
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,720
What's wrong with your chest?

108
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,380
Of course, it's real, unlike Maria.

109
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,000
See?

110
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,100
How bold!

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,420
A sister is always active.

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,020
Right?

113
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,580
This is...

114
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,600
I can't stand it!

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,280
I can't stand it!

116
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,600
What?

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,340
Hong Kong superstar Marilyn has declared a love with her actual lover?

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
Her partner is a public servant, aandidate.

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,540
He's Mr. Barbo.

120
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,020
How bold!

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,960
Now, I see...

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,560
This is a pocket video, Barbo.

123
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,700
How about marrying Marilyn instead?

124
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,100
Don't say that nonsense!

125
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
Oh, wait a minute.

126
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,640
What does this mean?

127
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,700
Hehehe.

128
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,180
Marrying Marilyn might be good.

129
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,100
No...

130
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,040
Watch out, Bulbon!

131
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
Bulbon, are you okay?

132
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,260
I just came out of the hole.

133
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
That's why I said watch out!

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,960
I was so wrong.

135
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,340
Jody again.

136
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,260
What's next?

137
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,860
This is...

138
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,560
Look, it's my birthday!

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,640
You thought about it.

140
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,800
You're so thoughtful.

141
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,580
You'll be a good wife.

142
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,140
I... I guess so.

143
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,840
I guess marriage with Jody is the best.

144
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,420
Dating in the pool of the fitness club is perfect for you two.

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
What? The pool?

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,460
Yes, it was written in Jody's letter.

147
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,440
That means...

148
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,680
Marry me.

149
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:07,720
I can't wait!

150
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't wait!

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,940
With this attitude, we still have a long way to go.

152
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,180
With this attitude, we still have a long way to go.

153
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,320
I guess so.

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,180
Someone's here.

155
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,980
Marilin!

156
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,640
Welcome back!

157
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,020
I've been waiting for you!

158
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Let's go inside!

159
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,440
Wait!

160
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,240
Bobby, you're a good boy.

161
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,420
This is...

162
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,240
I'm sorry!

163
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
But...

164
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,860
This is...

165
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,220
But...

166
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,260
Mar... Marilin...

167
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,520
W-What's that look?

168
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,980
Of course, I prepared it for Bobby.

169
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,940
Does it suit you?

170
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
It... It... It...

171
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,980
Stop it!

172
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,440
Bobby, are you okay?

173
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,520
Rin?

174
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,500
I knew you were here!

175
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,940
I saw the staff members looking for you.

176
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,500
You're making trouble for everyone.

177
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,460
What are you doing?

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,060
I get it, Ai.

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,260
I get it, Ai.

180
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,460
Hey, Bobby. What's this calendar sign?

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,980
It's my birthday.

182
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,300
Really? Then let's spend the day together!

183
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,000
I-I understand.

184
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm looking forward to it. Good night, Bobby.

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,660
Good night...

186
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,520
If I get in that mood on my birthday, I won't be able to get up.

187
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,620
I guess... something happened on my birthday...

188
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,620
What a sinful man I am!

189
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,080
I didn't know that I'd be playing with their hearts!

190
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,620
You just got into Marilyn's temper and forgot about your promise to Jody!

191
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm glad you're okay with this.

192
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,500
I'm glad you're okay with this. I'm glad you're okay with this.

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,340
I'm glad you're okay with this.

194
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,060
You were the same a year ago!

195
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,680
I happen to be at a workplace with no relationship with women...

196
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm sure I've seen him being popular before.

197
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,500
I'll kill you, you bastard!

198
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,140
Mr. Nakagawa, can't you consult with a man who's popular with you?

199
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,860
I-I guess...

200
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,060
Jody and Marilyn, I don't want to see either of you crying.

201
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,260
I don't want to see either of you crying.

202
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,000
I think you'll get really mad before you cry, little sister.

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,620
Eh? I'll get mad?

204
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,840
No, little sister is strong.

205
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
You were good at fighting in the movies, too.

206
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,600
Of course I was.

207
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,860
Since I was a child, I've been training in all kinds of fighting games.

208
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm afraid of you being mad, little sister.

209
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,220
You're as good as beating a cow with your bare hands.

210
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,100
What?

211
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,680
You're mad!

212
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,700
I see.

213
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,760
If you refuse to accept Marilyn's invitation, you'll have to follow the same fate as the cow.

214
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,460
Y-Yeah.

215
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,660
Marilyn can't stay in Japan until the filming starts.

216
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,900
Of course, I'll make her schedule more important.

217
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,060
But Jody's scared of you getting angry, too.

218
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,360
I heard you beat a bear with your bare hands.

219
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
A bear?

220
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,700
If you refuse to accept Jody's invitation, you'll have to follow the same fate as the cow.

221
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,840
If you refuse to accept Jody's invitation, you'll have to follow the same fate as the cow.

222
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,540
If you refuse to accept Jody's invitation, you'll have to follow the same fate as the cow.

223
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,420
A man with a lot of power is also a big trouble.

224
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,300
What should I do?

225
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,220
Tell me, Mr. Nakagawa!

226
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,400
You know that a man with a lot of power is Nakagawa, right?

227
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,320
I never dated such a great woman.

228
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,760
Is it okay for me to be a good-for-nothing?

229
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,380
Hmph!

230
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,920
Do something!

231
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Well, I'll go with the same plan as you.

232
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,480
Choose a cow or a bear, whichever you like.

233
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,100
Well, I'll go with the same plan as you.

234
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,520
You're such a bad girl!

235
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,060
You're such a bad girl!

236
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,800
Wait.

237
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,720
This might be a good chance to make that man a good man.

238
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,060
Okay, I got it.

239
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,220
It's a request from a Volvo.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,020
Leave it to me.

241
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,240
Really?

242
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,680
Yeah, really.

243
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,660
Thank you, Ryotsu!

244
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,720
I'll be grateful to you!

245
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,500
I'll be grateful to you!

246
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,640
You can be happy now.

247
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,280
You can be happy now.

248
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,460
You can be happy now.

249
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,760
We should go now.

250
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,740
It will be hard to close the door if he shows up.

251
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,360
Then let's stay here, right?

252
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,640
Let's go!

253
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:19,760
Dibble, are you all right?

254
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,500
The Parking gamma will keep my business at loggerheads.

255
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,980
Okay, let's go!

256
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,140
What's up?

257
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,860
Now, now, this is what I'm talking about.

258
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,020
I'll have a look at your place.

259
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,320
It's not mine.

260
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
Well, I'll call the police now.

261
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,260
How many assistants are we looking for?

262
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,360
They have the costumes that can handle any situation.

263
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,740
Nakagawa is really something.

264
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,560
By the way, I've been wondering.

265
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,780
Why do you have a video camera?

266
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,440
I don't really know, but...

267
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,860
Senpai told me to film the scene of the date.

268
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Double dates are like talking to someone else at the same time.

269
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,940
As you go by, you may not know what you were talking about.

270
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,580
You may not know what you were talking about.

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
Then you can watch the video.

272
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,500
I see.

273
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,160
But there's another way to use it.

274
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
You don't have any experience with double dates, but you're really into it.

275
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,160
Sorry about that!

276
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,780
Senpai, we're almost at the fitness club.

277
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,020
The hell of a double date is about to begin.

278
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,160
Hey, Johnny!

279
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,860
Bobby!

280
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,260
Johnny!

281
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,840
It's about to begin. Let's start filming.

282
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,660
Okay.

283
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,620
What's this?

284
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,000
This swimsuit is specially prepared for your birthday.

285
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,880
Does it suit you?

286
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,340
I-I-I-I can't stand it!

287
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,160
Bobby, are you okay?

288
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,660
I can't stand this tight feeling!

289
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,320
It's a little scary.

290
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,480
You know, Shinopuru is one of my seven mysteries in elementary school.

291
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,320
Same here. I can't believe I got to see real things.

292
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,740
Huh? Oh, it broke.

293
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,880
It's me.

294
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,940
Mr. Marilyn has just entered the shop.

295
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,020
I see. Please come quickly.

296
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,600
Yes, ma'am.

297
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
I hope this rest is going to calm you down.

298
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
Thank you, Jody.

299
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,440
Oh, how gentle of you.

300
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,920
Jody…

301
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,840
I hope you'll do the same thing after you get married.

302
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm the happiest man in the world.

303
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,080
What's wrong, Bobby?

304
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,200
Bobby!

305
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
N-Nothing.

306
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,460
I'm going to take a break in the office.

307
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,600
Me too.

308
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,460
I-I'll be back soon, so please wait.

309
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:55,680
Wait for me.

310
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,800
If you don't wear a tie, you can't enter that store.

311
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,800
Understood.

312
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,100
Welcome.

313
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,460
You're Mr. Volvo Saigo, right?

314
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:12,920
That's right.

315
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,720
Bobby!

316
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,680
I prepared a special dress for today's date.

317
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,520
Does it suit you?

318
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,100
I-I can't stand it.

319
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,140
What's wrong, Bobby?

320
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,080
N-Nothing.

321
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,580
It's quiet here.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,620
It's as if we're the only customers in this store.

323
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,120
I made a reservation for today.

324
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,860
I wanted to spend time with you alone.

325
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,800
I-I feel like my chest is...

326
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,160
It's a blood-stained ceiling.

327
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,980
It's a summer story.

328
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,440
Oh, it's me.

329
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,940
I'm in trouble.

330
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,440
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,680
Jody started looking for Mr. Volvo.

332
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,040
Well, eat up.

333
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,500
This looks delicious.

334
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
Here, Bobby.

335
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
Th-thank you.

336
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,580
She's so kind.

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,460
I wonder if she'll be like this even after we get married.

338
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,020
I'm the happiest man in the universe.

339
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,800
Bobby, what's wrong?

340
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,200
N-Nothing.

341
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm going to the bathroom.

342
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,360
Hurry up.

343
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,000
Jody's waiting.

344
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,360
It's about time.

345
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,500
Hey, the tape's about to come off.

346
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,040
What?

347
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,760
There should be a convenience store over there.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
Go and buy it.

349
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,700
I'll take care of the car.

350
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,100
Okay.

351
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,220
There's a car that's been illegally parked in front of the fitness club.

352
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,500
Can you get it out of the way?

353
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,480
Yes.

354
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,600
Let's go.

355
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,740
I'm sorry, but I was a little distracted, and I got kicked out.

356
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,920
No, how do we get to the Chinese restaurant?

357
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,380
I guess we have to run.

358
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,540
What about the clothes?

359
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,160
It's a shop for wearing ties.

360
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,300
Lend them to Nagagawa.

361
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,940
Nagagawa, go with him.

362
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,260
Okay, I understand.

363
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,360
Let's go then.

364
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,720
All right.

365
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,200
What do I do?

366
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,180
You're a bully, so you need to learn.

367
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,940
You two go with the corvins.

368
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,620
But you must leave the tape on.

369
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,040
What?

370
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,020
What's wrong with you?

371
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,320
Sorry, but it's not suspicious.

372
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,180
Hey, sorry for making you wait.

373
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,360
Bobby, what happened to your costume?

374
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,800
I had some trouble in the toilet.

375
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,440
It's not a big deal.

376
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,120
Bobby, come on.

377
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,460
Oh, come on.

378
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,480
Hey, Jody.

379
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,720
You're in a hurry.

380
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,100
What are you doing?

381
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Bobby disappeared on a date.

382
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,480
What?

383
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
Did he have a date with you?

384
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,940
Oh, no.

385
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,480
With you?

386
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,120
What do you mean?

387
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,240
I didn't ask.

388
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,380
What's with the tape?

389
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,400
This is...

390
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,220
You got it now, right?

391
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,400
Actually, it's from Volvo.

392
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,240
He and Jody were having a fight.

393
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,740
What did he say?

394
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,060
For him, women are just a game.

395
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
I won't forgive you.

396
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,040
I'll never forgive you.

397
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,900
I got it.

398
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,280
Marilyn, I got a call.

399
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,500
I got it.

400
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
Here it is.

401
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,440
You're...

402
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,660
Marilyn, I have something important to tell you.

403
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,240
These two have become slaves.

404
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,940
They were trying to take away your property.

405
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,340
You're a terrible villain.

406
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,420
I can't stand you.

407
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,900
I'll never forgive you.

408
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,300
Now you know Volvo's fate.

409
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,600
You're a woman's enemy.

410
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,880
You're a woman's enemy.

411
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,120
You're a woman's enemy.

412
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,200
Don't lie to me!

413
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,380
You're a loser who made fun of me.

414
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,260
What?

415
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,320
What?

416
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,520
What was that?

417
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,720
Jody!

418
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,640
What?

419
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,740
I can't believe they came in here.

420
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Jody, this is ridiculous.

421
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,540
Jody, you got away.

422
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll never forgive you if you resort to despisancy!

423
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,180
Poor Bobby!

424
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,960
You were fooled by that pertaining woman, weren't you?

425
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,240
What?

426
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,120
Let's get out of here and start the birthday party!

427
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,380
Why would you do that!?

428
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,820
Hey, who do you think you are?

429
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,540
You're the one who's trying to drag Bobby into the path of evil!

430
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,200
I won't let that happen to Bobby!

431
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,840
No! Bobby belongs to me!

432
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,420
Don't touch him!

433
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,080
That's enough! Just go to hell!

434
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,980
I'm going to eat you!

435
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,480
Let go of me!

436
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,420
I said let go of me!

437
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,900
You're...

438
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,820
Now then, I have no choice but to defeat you!

439
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,440
Because you're a mystery!

440
00:21:49,640 --> 00:22:04,080
You and I are in this together!

441
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,260
This is a big fight.

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,220
As expected from a bear and a cow.

443
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,560
You're a bear and a cow.

444
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:10,860
You're a bear and a cow.

445
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
I'm not a bear.

446
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,560
I'm not a cow.

447
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,720
You're a bear.

448
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,100
What are you going to do?

449
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,220
The enemy is Boruto!

450
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,700
Hooray!

451
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,660
They're all so annoying.

452
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,480
Ouch!

453
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:48,920
Help me!

454
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,260
Help me!

455
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:13,000
Why did this happen?

456
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,160
Bobby, where are you?

457
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,100
Bobby!

458
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
Ouch!

459
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,640
That's...

460
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,100
I'll take care of Bobby!

461
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,840
See you!

462
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,880
I didn't know they had such a thing.

463
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,980
You're the best actress in Hong Kong.

464
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,980
Damn!

465
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll take Bobby back, even if I have to die!

466
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll take care of Bobby!
