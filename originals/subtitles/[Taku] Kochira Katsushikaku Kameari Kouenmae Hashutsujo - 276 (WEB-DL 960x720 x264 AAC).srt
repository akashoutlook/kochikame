1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:00,880
The

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,240
The

3
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,700
The

4
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,280
The

5
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,100
The

6
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,300
The

7
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,400
The

8
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,800
The

9
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:06,840
The

10
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:06,880
The

11
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,160
The

12
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,200
The

13
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

14
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,760
make your room bright and

15
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,940
try to look away!

16
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,000
Come to me,

17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
you poor guy!

18
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm not here,

19
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,920
but I'm worried.

20
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,160
That's the advice I'll give you.

21
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,160
Come on,

22
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,740
you blue sky,

23
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,880
you white cloud.

24
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,780
You'll see what you can do

25
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,180
in no time.

26
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,020
WAA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,520
I have no work,

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:57,900
I have nothing,

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,800
Come to me!

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

31
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,940
Look, the red spider is burning

32
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,320
It'll be all right

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,580
You know it, right?

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,140
You know it, right?

35
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,740
If you know it, then come to me!

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
Men are wild!

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,080
What's wrong with this mountain of curry?

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,120
What's wrong with this mountain of curry?

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Are you starting a curry shop?

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,100
No, I'm just selling the curry I bought cheaply from left to right

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm just trying to earn a middle margin

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,800
Middle margin?

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,280
But at such a time, the small shop I was supposed to sell had refused

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,600
What? This curry is only two weeks away from expiration

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,240
That's why it was cheap

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,520
Of course it was refused

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,760
Damn it, all that's left is debt

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,180
You still have the curry

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,740
Shut up! I know that even if you don't tell me that

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,180
So what are you going to do?

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,300
Nakagawa, please buy it for me

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,160
What? I'm in trouble if you say that all of a sudden

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,500
You're rich, aren't you?

54
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,100
Isn't it a little bit?

55
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,700
It's not a little bit. How many do you have?

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,020
A hundred-color cardboard box

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,220
That means ten thousand colors?

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,860
How about four families and a box?

59
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,040
I have children, so I can only eat sweet curry

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,960
What about Reiko?

61
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,600
I decided to eat curry when I went to Thailand and India

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
You're so stingy

63
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,040
That's enough. If you're like this, eat it yourself

64
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:12,500
I feel sorry for him, but if he's dating Ryo, the national budget wouldn't be enough

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,860
It can't be helped

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,340
I can't eat because there's no rice

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,720
I can't eat

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,140
Well then

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,080
If this happens, I'll eat curry and eat curry

70
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,360
After all, curry alone has its limits

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
I want rice

72
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,160
Mr. Ryoji

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,100
How is Honda?

74
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,940
I came to a good place

75
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,460
Do you need curry?

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
Curry? No, no

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,000
That's not all for today

78
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,500
Actually, I want to buy a car

79
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,020
I wonder if Senpai would come with me

80
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,980
I thought you'd come with me

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,980
A car? A motorcycle?

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,220
That's because

83
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,780
I always have two motorcycles when I go out with Nana

84
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,260
Sometimes we drive together

85
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,940
I wonder if that's okay

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,440
Senpai, are you good at buying?

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,140
If you buy it cheaply, I'll thank you

88
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,900
Thank you?

89
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,100
Intermediate margin?

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,040
I want to fill the curry hole a little bit now

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,660
Yes, leave it to me

92
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,440
Really, Senpai?

93
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,540
If that's the case, I'll be in a hurry

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,140
Let's go

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,340
Senpai, where are you going?

96
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,340
It's a patrol

97
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,140
No, it's not

98
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,860
What are you going to do with the curry mountain in the back?

99
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
I won't forget it, so it's okay

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,420
I'll do something later

101
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,780
See you

102
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,820
I'll definitely forget about curry

103
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,580
What kind of car do you want?

104
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,840
It would be great if I could ride a Porsche

105
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,640
Porsche?

106
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,380
I see

107
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,500
What's the budget?

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,480
I have 100,000 yen

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,740
100,000 yen is not enough for the capital

110
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,800
It's not the capital, it's all

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm looking forward to it

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,580
35 years of loan?

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,240
It's not a housing loan

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,200
It's a little long

115
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,240
The price is a little like a house

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,140
Do something about it

117
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,720
Even if you say so

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
It's worth a lot to a luxury car

119
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,260
Senpai, Porsche is just a joke

120
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,180
After all, 100,000 yen is impossible

121
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,980
Don't be weak as soon as you get off the bike

122
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,500
Then it's that

123
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,740
Is there anything cheap?

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,180
What's like a family Porsche?

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
Something like that

126
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,980
I understand

127
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,100
I will prepare a perfect Porsche for the customer

128
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,360
Oh, how about it?

129
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,840
I'll try it, Honda

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,800
Yes, but is it true?

131
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,900
Here it is

132
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, it's small

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,280
A same-sex Porsche exhaust

134
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,240
20,000 yen

135
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, how do you ride this?

136
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,280
We want the real one, the real one

137
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,780
However, at our store, as a principle

138
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,260
I don't do long-term loans

139
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,900
How do you buy it without paying the loan?

140
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,860
Such a high car

141
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,200
This is

142
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
This is Miyashita-sama

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,860
Welcome

144
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,600
Hey, I haven't lived here yet

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,840
This is

146
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,820
This is

147
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,540
This is a new model that just entered last week

148
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,620
Hmm, it's pretty good

149
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,500
How much?

150
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,500
Including the amount and the initial expense

151
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,520
It will be about 35 million yen

152
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,000
35 million

153
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,760
It's expensive

154
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,980
Hmm, 35

155
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,100
Then give me one

156
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,820
Hey

157
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,160
Thank you every time

158
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,980
I will continue now

159
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,520
Please come here

160
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,600
You have to pay a lot when you come to this store

161
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,540
Still, the new car is impossible

162
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,420
There is a friend in the used car store

163
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,900
Shall we go there?

164
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,680
Yes

165
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,660
Hello, Ryo-san

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,180
CEO, we have a budget of 100,000 Pocky

167
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,320
I want to buy a cheap Porsche

168
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
Do you have it?

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,820
It's Mr. Ryo's

170
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,760
No matter how many used cars, 100,000 Porsche

171
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Porsche?

172
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,580
I have

173
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,660
It's 80,000

174
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,120
What?

175
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,340
It's brand new.

176
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,480
Wow, this is 80,000 yen.

177
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,180
How is it?

178
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,780
You can pay me 20,000 yen as an intermediate margin.

179
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,900
Yes, but...

180
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,680
Is this really running?

181
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,860
How is it?

182
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,880
It runs properly.

183
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,680
It's like a dream to have 80,000 yen.

184
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,240
Yakko seems to have liked it a lot.

185
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,540
That's good.

186
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,380
It's amazing and cool.

187
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,660
I will invite Nana-chan and go to Chiba.

188
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,280
However, it's a kit car, so I can't get the number.

189
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,720
I thought there was something.

190
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,180
If you can't get the number, you can't run the road.

191
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,180
I will run in my own garden.

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,320
I will decorate it and look at it.

193
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,420
There are various ways to win.

194
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,820
No, I want to run outside.

195
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,420
It's selfish.

196
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,660
Then I will look at other cars.

197
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:07,780
To the next.

198
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,140
Well, I will go out and get down.

199
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,560
That's 30,000 yen.

200
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,020
It looks bad, but I can run outside.

201
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,460
You have a strong shoulder.

202
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,220
Can you walk properly?

203
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,940
Of course, I can still run.

204
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,380
It's quite rusty.

205
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,240
The rust has a good taste.

206
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,440
There are people who make rust with the help of oil.

207
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,760
Natural rust is the best.

208
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
The tire feels like Marubozu.

209
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,580
What are you talking about, Ryo-san?

210
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
There is no groove in the racing car.

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
There's no groove in the car.

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,300
It's sandpaper polished.

213
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,920
Well, you can pay 70,000 yen for my mid-margin.

214
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,500
It's too hard after Porsche.

215
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,700
I can't understand why the mid-margin is higher than the car.

216
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,880
You greedy guy.

217
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,300
Which one is it?

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,640
How about this?

219
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,960
It's beautiful and has horsepower.

220
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,760
50,000 yen is fine.

221
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,580
30,000 yen in head money and the split payment is also OK.

222
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,600
I'll take this Honda.

223
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,800
No, I don't want to go to a luxury car.

224
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,220
I want to drive a more stylish and cool car.

225
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
What are you talking about Honda?

226
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,000
This is a stylish and cool open car depending on the design.

227
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,080
This is a mid-margin.

228
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,960
I won't pay for such a thing.

229
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,780
What?

230
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,160
It's a different promise.

231
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,560
It's getting further and further away from my expectations.

232
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
It's easy to say that you should drive a stylish and cool car with a budget of 100,000 yen.

233
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,420
Because you're a professional.

234
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,220
You shouldn't expect too much from me.

235
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,860
I see.

236
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,620
You have a cheap and clean left-hand drive.

237
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,540
Isn't it Rolls-Royce?

238
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,900
And it's 20,000 yen.

239
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,060
There's no other car like this.

240
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,980
But I'm sure it's a reasonable price.

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,300
Wait, president.

242
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,680
What are you hiding?

243
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
I'll tell you the truth.

244
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,000
Actually, that car is a car accident.

245
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:05,980
What?

246
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,600
There is a rumor that the owner always has a flat tire, so I took it with a cheap price.

247
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:19,020
But because the price is too cheap, I was careful and couldn't buy it, and I couldn't dispose of it, so it's been there since.

248
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,900
Ah, a flat tire.

249
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,880
What? That's it.

250
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,280
That's a flat tire, senpai.

251
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,520
That's a name.

252
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,380
Rather, I think it's a carnavi, an airbag, and a flat tire as standard equipment.

253
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,420
Ah, that's true.

254
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,700
I don't think so.

255
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,300
Even if you put a carnavi and an airbag, it's a flat tire.

256
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,280
This may be a fate.

257
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,680
I can't think of it.

258
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,140
Well, maybe the flat tire won't happen anymore.

259
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,820
I don't know what happened, but there's no problem if you drive properly.

260
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,060
It's too scary to see the rearview mirror.

261
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,780
It's getting dark.

262
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,820
Senpai.

263
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,240
Don't look behind you.

264
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,120
But...

265
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
But...

266
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,500
Go slowly and go straight.

267
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,220
Even if I say that, senpai...

268
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,880
If the budget is 100,000 yen, we have only this much.

269
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,180
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,720
I don't think I'm interested in cars, after all.

271
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,260
I lost my curry, so I thought I'd fill a little hole in the middle margin from Honda.

272
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,660
I lost my curry, so I thought I'd fill a little hole in the middle margin from Honda.

273
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,540
What's that?

274
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
That's enough.

275
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,300
Let's go home, senpai.

276
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,440
What?

277
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,020
What?

278
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,100
Isn't it a carnavi car?

279
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,580
That's a carnavi car, and it's going to be scrapped.

280
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,880
Are you going to crush it?

281
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,280
Yeah.

282
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,140
It won't be sold.

283
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,700
It's a waste, isn't it?

284
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,160
I've used it for more than 10 years, and the mileage is low.

285
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,840
I've used it for more than 10 years, and the mileage is low.

286
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,980
I've used it for more than 10 years, and the mileage is low.

287
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,920
Hey, look.

288
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,220
It's got a lot of red blood.

289
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,220
Where did you get it?

290
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,180
It's a fire brigade from the Yamaoku village.

291
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,700
It's a fire brigade from the Yamaoku village.

292
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,740
It's a fire brigade from the Yamaoku village.

293
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,660
It's a fire brigade from the Yamaoku village.

294
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,140
I don't think the carnavi car is very active in that area.

295
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:50,620
It's a waste.

296
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,280
I can't use it for anything.

297
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,720
I can't use it for anything.

298
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,340
That's right!

299
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,200
Honda!

300
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,460
Buy this car for your 100,000 yen!

301
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,160
What?

302
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,140
What's the point of buying a fire brigade?

303
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,720
It's a curry!

304
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,860
It's a curry!

305
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,460
What is that noise?

306
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,280
What was that car?

307
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,300
It was a car that had a ladder.

308
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,300
It was a car that had a ladder.

309
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,220
All right, that's all.

310
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,580
Hello, everyone in the exam room.

311
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,140
Hello, everyone in the exam room.

312
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,460
You've worked hard studying every day and night.

313
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,060
How are you feeling?

314
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,000
The poor student's companion, Ryo Curry!

315
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,100
Ryo Curry!

316
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,520
Ryo Curry is here!

317
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,360
Alright, let's go!

318
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,380
Yes!

319
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,980
Alright, come here!

320
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,240
Wait a minute...

321
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,440
W-What?

322
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,660
Hello.

323
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,320
There are many kinds of curry, but there's also a special curry, which is called "Goukaku Curry".

324
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,820
How about that?

325
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,860
Um... What's a "Goukaku Curry"?

326
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,320
It's a curry with raw eggs and lots of nutrients.

327
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,360
And you're the one who's gonna win!

328
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,800
Then, I'll have one of those "Goukaku Curry".

329
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,100
Yes! I'll have a "Goukaku Curry" "Oomori-1"!

330
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,820
Namaste!

331
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,520
"Goukaku Omori-1"! Namaste!

332
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,620
Namaste!

333
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,200
Namaste!

334
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:47,820
Namaste!

335
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,260
Yes! Ryo Curry "Goukaku Curry" "Oomori-500" is here!

336
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,800
I'll have one "Goukaku Curry" too!

337
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,020
I'm counting on you!

338
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,960
Yes, yes! Namaste!

339
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,420
Honda-kun!

340
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,140
"Goukaku Curry" "Oomori-2" "Chuumori-3"

341
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,380
"Oomori-2" "Chuumori-3"

342
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,760
And then, "Oomori-1" "Goukaku Curry" "Oomori-3"

343
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,240
And then, "Oomori-1" "Goukaku Curry" "Oomori-3"

344
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:21,040
And then, "Oomori-1" "Goukaku Curry" "Chuumori-1"

345
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,660
"Goukaku curry" "Oomori-1" "Chuumori-1"

346
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,140
"Goukaku Curry" "Chuumori-3" "Oomori-1"

347
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,480
"Chuumori-3" "Oomori-1"

348
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,300
And then...

349
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,120
Oh my god! I don't know what's going on!

350
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,960
Namaste!

351
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,200
Whatever, just carry them in the car, Namaste!

352
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,760
Which one is the big one and which one is the small one?

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Well, Honda-kun, the ladder ride-on.

354
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,460
Namaste!

355
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Here, the big one is 500 yen.

356
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
And that one is the small one, 450 yen.

357
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,200
Namaste!

358
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,360
The curry with the pass rate will be an extra 100 yen each.

359
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,540
Please make sure you don't miss the food.

360
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,620
Namaste!

361
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,460
Namaste!

362
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,720
Namaste!

363
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,000
Namaste!

364
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,260
Namaste!

365
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,520
Namaste!

366
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,220
Namaste!

367
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Namaste!

368
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,380
200 yen...

369
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,140
We sold out.

370
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,900
It was a good deal on the first day, wasn't it?

371
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,620
Why am I in the curry shop?

372
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,340
It's a great ride-on, Honda.

373
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,820
Please forgive me, senpai.

374
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,920
I wanted a normal car that I could drive,

375
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,940
but I bought a ladder car.

376
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,480
When you saw this, you were as excited as a child.

377
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,560
So you don't buy it, do you?

378
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,760
Here's my 100,000 yen.

379
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,360
It's the end of today.

380
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

381
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,020
So buy your favorite car.

382
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,440
Huh?

383
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,480
But, Honda.

384
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,460
A man must not forget the two letters of ambition.

385
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Ambition?

386
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,920
The ambition is to earn more and more from today and tomorrow,

387
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,760
and one day, I'll become rich!

388
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,380
Ambition...

389
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,440
With a ladder car just before Scrap,

390
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,840
I want to be rich from the bottom of my heart.

391
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,120
Senpai, please help me with the curry shop.

392
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,540
What?

393
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,020
Are you sure?

394
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm sure.

395
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,780
But with that money, I can only buy a kit car Porsche that can't run outside.

396
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,580
After all, I want to buy a Porsche with cash like that rich man,

397
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,480
and I also want to buy a Ferrari and a Benz.

398
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,060
That's my ambition.

399
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,020
I see.

400
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,980
Buy a Porsche.

401
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,380
Buy five or six cars.

402
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,420
That's what a man is.

403
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,480
Yes, sir.

404
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,060
We swear here now.

405
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,180
We'll fight until we sell 10,000 curry shops.

406
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,280
In the name of the dead Chichan...

407
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,100
What?

408
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,220
Senpai's grandfather is still alive in Tsukuda Island.

409
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
In the name of the old man!

410
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,440
Yes, sir.

411
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,800
Six days until the curry is sold.

412
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,840
I can't wait.

413
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,720
Hey, the wife of the mammoth.

414
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,660
How are you doing?

415
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,660
Hello.

416
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,180
In the midst of a busy day,

417
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,240
why don't you take a break today and have a lot of nutritious curry?

418
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,540
Two servings, please.

419
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,580
Here, too.

420
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,660
Yes, sir.

421
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,640
I'll take a look.

422
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,540
Oh, my wife here.

423
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,180
You look a little thin.

424
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
Oh, my.

425
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
It's my first time seeing you.

426
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,680
Oh, really?

427
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,740
You're so good.

428
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,500
Here's a large pack.

429
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:34,900
Don't get sick.

430
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
Lunch break.

431
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,460
Buy yakisoba bread at the store.

432
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,500
You're a junior high school student who wants to buy a lot of things.

433
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,960
Hello.

434
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,300
How about hot curry sometimes?

435
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,840
Oh, my.

436
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,400
Oh, my.

437
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,040
Oh, my.

438
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,920
What are you doing?

439
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Hello, everyone in the office outside Marunouchi.

440
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,420
If you don't have any customers to survive this impoverished country,

441
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,000
you'll be out of here.

442
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,320
If you don't buy it, you'll buy it.

443
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,060
The enthusiasm and courage.

444
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,120
This is important.

445
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,560
The ladder car is a bizarre idea.

446
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
If there is a paper to throw away, there is a paper to pick up.

447
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,680
Is that so?

448
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,380
I'll take it.

449
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,460
Why did you compete in a curry single?

450
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,120
It's a stock market competition.

451
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,560
What?

452
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,440
No, that's not it.

453
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,180
There is little profit.

454
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,380
Of course, there is little loss.

455
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,540
You all have a lot of experience.

456
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,880
At dinner time, the smell of curry flowing from your neighborhood.

457
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,220
That smell that makes you want to eat and drink.

458
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,140
I thought this was the only thing.

459
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,840
I don't want to eat curry anymore.

460
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,900
The curry shop at the end of the road may go to your town.

461
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,800
If you say "Namaste" to me, I will give you a large curry.

462
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,700
Yes, yes. There is still enough money, so please line up in order.

463
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,140
Honda, what's wrong?

464
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,460
I did it.

465
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,700
Cheers to the 10,000th meal within the expiration date.

466
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,840
Honda, don't sleep yet. There are many people waiting outside.

467
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,100
Because there is no curry and rice.

468
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,540
Don't worry. I have already ordered additional food.

469
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,220
Curry and rice for 20,000 meals will arrive soon.

470
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,480
20,000 meals!

471
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,180
Please let me rest a little, Senpai. I haven't slept for five days.

472
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,940
Five days? This is the place of the boy's life.

473
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,660
Honda, where is your ambition?

474
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,740
Ambition?

475
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,340
Porsche, BMW, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz.

476
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,040
Ambition?

477
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,940
Ambition!

478
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,940
Yes!

479
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,800
The expiration date is three days later. I will sell it and sell it.

480
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,240
Namaste.

481
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,060
Porsche is the best. Porsche is...

482
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,180
What?

483
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,280
It's a fire!

484
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,480
It's terrible, Senpai!

485
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,820
Hey, carry the curry and the lunch break will be over.

486
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,700
That's not the point, Senpai!

487
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,860
Help me!

488
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,700
Hurry up and report to the fire and run away!

489
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,640
Honda, stretch the ladder!

490
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,160
Help me!

491
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,120
Hurry up and get on this side!

492
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,140
That guy is a firecracker!

493
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,120
What?

494
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,060
Honda!

495
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,800
Honda!

496
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,560
Yes!

497
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,960
Run fast, it is a fire!

498
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,600
Honda, hurry up!

499
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:35,920
Yes!

500
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,080
Damn it! I'm not letting you escape!

501
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
Increase the speed!

502
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,720
Full speed! The body is heavy! I can't go any further!

503
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,160
You don't own 4 wheels and a point!

504
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,640
He went to meet my ambition!

505
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,460
Aren't you disappointed?

506
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,000
What!

507
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,740
Ga, ga, ga!

508
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,660
Tarei's okay!

509
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,380
Stop that!

510
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
Wait up!

511
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,320
Uh, a twin, not a double!

512
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,680
Hey, why don't you give it a rise?

513
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,440
It's for a reason!

514
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,000
Wah!

515
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,400
Stop!

516
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,860
Stop right there!

517
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Honda! The criminal went that way!

518
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,700
Put the ladder back!

519
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,100
Alright!

520
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,780
Wait, you!

521
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,140
I'm gonna crash!

522
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,160
Wait!

523
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm not running away!

524
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,180
I'm not running away!

525
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,320
My money!

526
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,340
My 20,000 yen!

527
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,360
Ryo, I have a request for you.

528
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,040
What? A request?

529
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,520
The repair cost of the building is 180,500,000 yen.

530
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,420
The repair cost of the pedestrian bridge, the electric pole, the guard rail and other other repair costs are 100,000,000 yen.

531
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,980
Other than that, there are many other violations of the traffic law.

532
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,620
There are many other violations of the traffic law.

533
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,400
And the cost of the repair cost is 300,000,000 yen.

534
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,400
The loan is not valid.

535
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,620
That's all for today.

536
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,680
Wait, chief!

537
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,160
You arrested the law enforcement.

538
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,040
Why am I the one who's paying for it?

539
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,560
You idiot!

540
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,680
I don't care anymore if you're trying to change the car.

541
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
No, chief!

542
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,700
What about my Porsche?

543
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,420
What about my drive with Nana?

544
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
That's not the point!

545
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,080
I should have stopped when the curry was sold out.

546
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,600
I should have stopped when the curry was sold out.

547
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,460
I shouldn't have done that.

548
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,220
Do you mean that your bad ambitions?

549
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,360
Good grief.

550
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,900
Why did this happen?

551
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,300
Do you have a different method than before?

552
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
I don't think I have a choice.

553
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,480
Next time.

554
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,420
Why?

555
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,480
Why?

556
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,580
Why did Ryo-san do that?

557
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,000
Why?

558
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,680
Ryo's eyebrows look like black hair

559
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,900
Why?

560
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,560
He wears sandals but he runs really fast

561
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,900
Why?

562
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,220
Ryo is always arm wrestling

563
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,320
Why?

564
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,360
He's so flimsy but he's loved by everyone

565
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,800
Why?

566
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,120
Why?

567
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,740
It doesn't matter

568
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,820
The title of this anime is so long

569
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,120
This is Katsushikaku, Kamayari Park's first appearance

570
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,440
Why?

571
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,420
Why?

572
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,940
Everyone, let's do it together!

573
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,540
Why?

574
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:13,680
Why?

575
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,960
Why?

576
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,320
Why?

577
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,760
Why?

578
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,160
Why?

579
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,480
Why?

580
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,260
Why?

581
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,060
March 3rd is my birthday

582
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,720
But every time I see this day, I get unhappy

583
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,240
This year I was going to have a good time

584
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,540
Why am I making a real Hina doll?

585
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,040
Why am I making Hina dolls?

586
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,980
Next time "O-Hina Sanzan Birthday"

587
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,620
"O-Hina Sanzan Birthday"

588
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,120
Thank you for watching!

589
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,660
Thank you for watching!

590
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,400
Thank you so much.

591
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,020
Thank you.
