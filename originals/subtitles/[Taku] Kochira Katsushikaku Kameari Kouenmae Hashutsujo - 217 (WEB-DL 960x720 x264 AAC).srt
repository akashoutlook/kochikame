1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:07,600
"A Man Without Money"

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,160
"When you watch TV, try to keep the room bright and away from it."

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,040
"A Man Without Money"

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:23,860
A man without money, come to me!

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,680
"I'm not here, but I'm worried."

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:36,420
"Look at the blue sky and the white clouds."

7
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,200
"I'm sure that one day, it'll be alright."

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,040
"You know what to do, right?"

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,960
"You know what to do, right?"

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,500
"If you know what to do, then shut up and follow me!"

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,200
"I'm not here, but I'm worried."

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,860
"I'm not here, but I'm worried."

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,520
"I'm not here, but I'm worried."

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,460
"What's this guy?"

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,860
"Is he a cop?"

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,680
"How could you leave such a man like that?"

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,460
"It's the police's fault."

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,400
"I can't believe he's a cop."

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,160
"How do you feel about the job interview?"

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
"A wise decision."

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,560
"There's no reason for me to say that."

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,000
"I don't think he can be a person with a different opinion."

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,980
"We are all in the same boat."

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,000
"Wait a minute!"

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,720
"What? What is it, Tonda?"

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,880
"I have something to say. How about we make a decision in advance?"

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,900
"Do you think this man is suitable for a cop?"

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:51,900
"No, I'm sure he's a man with a lot of problems, but I don't think he's worth it."

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,160
What do you mean?

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,480
Well, that's something.

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,560
Are you saying you're going to re-educate this man?

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,080
What?

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Me?

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,420
Yes.

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,280
I'm going to make sure this man becomes a true police officer.

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,760
That's...

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,140
What do you say, Tonda?

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,340
Tonda-kun!

39
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,740
Ryo-san, finally you're fired.

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,880
But I heard that you've lost your job, Tonda.

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,980
I heard that you were given a condition to re-educate him.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,500
But that's within a week.

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,880
You've been living with that personality all this time, haven't you?

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,440
To change that in a week...

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,180
Nakagawa-san, did you hear that?

46
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,000
Ryo Tsukankichi is fired.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,440
He's going to be fired.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,340
I heard that.

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,340
You're a man of your word, aren't you?

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,220
If he's fired, he'll be in trouble.

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Right?

52
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,580
Do you really think so?

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,340
What?

54
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,320
This is a serious matter, unlike usual.

55
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,140
If you guys really quit, you'll be very lonely.

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,760
Ryo-sama...

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Maria-chan.

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,400
Ryo-sama, I won't say it because you're that kind of person.

59
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,240
But you truly love the job of a police officer.

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,440
I-I can't believe you're fired.

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,840
I feel so sorry for you.

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
It's not just Maria-san.

63
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,400
She's always been treated badly.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,680
But if I really lost Ryo-san...

65
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,180
...

66
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,120
...

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,500
...

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,420
...

69
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,080
...

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,300
...

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
...

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,220
...

73
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,260
...

74
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,340
...

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,440
...

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,420
...

77
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,540
...

78
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,200
...

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,440
...

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,460
...

81
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,500
...

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
...

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,160
Excuse me, President.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,620
I have something to tell you regarding the Ryo-san investigation.

85
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,040
Huh?

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:05,840
What?

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,040
I can't believe it.

88
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
As the president of the Ryo-sensei...

89
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,660
...

90
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:14,740
...

91
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,500
...

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:15,920
...

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,020
...

94
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,060
...

95
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,080
...

96
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,540
...

97
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:17,620
...

98
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:17,640
...

99
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:33,780
...

100
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:33,800
...

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:33,820
...

102
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,240
...

103
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,280
...

104
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,300
...

105
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:34,740
...

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:34,760
...

107
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:34,780
...

108
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:34,800
...

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:34,820
...

110
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:34,840
...

111
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:34,860
...

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,040
...

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
Over there? Over there? Where is it?

114
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,200
Where are you taking me?

115
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,060
Hey! Where are we? Let's go!

116
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,380
What? This is my room!

117
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,540
This is my room!

118
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,220
Ouch!

119
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,700
What is this?

120
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,160
This is a trap!

121
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,780
Damn, it won't open.

122
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,640
It's useless, Ryo. The door won't open.

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,060
Reiko! Where is this?

124
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,640
I thought it was Nico Nico Ryo, but this room is fake!

125
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,100
Ryo, listen carefully.

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,080
This is the research lab of the Akimoto Group.

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,280
Research lab?

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,880
We are going to re-educate Ryo here.

129
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,340
He is reborn.

130
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,020
Re-educate? Reborn?

131
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,140
Anyway, you should go to bed early today.

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,580
You'll be in trouble tomorrow.

133
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
Trouble? What trouble?

134
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Hey!

135
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,020
Hey, hey!

136
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,720
Ryo!

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,080
I'm so exited!

138
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,520
I'm really exited!

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,080
Uwa!

140
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,580
Uwa!

141
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,740
Huh, what?

142
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,940
I don't know!

143
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,240
What the?

144
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,060
Damn it!

145
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,960
It won't open, Ryo!

146
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,240
I won't get out of this.

147
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,500
It's a virtual чувствate mask.

148
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,220
Virtual чувствate mask?

149
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,540
Gipsu?

150
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,520
Reiko, I'll explain it to you properly!

151
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,340
I'll completely change you in the next week, so be prepared.

152
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll change your short-term, violent, irresponsible body from the bottom of your heart and become a person who can protect the rules of society.

153
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,300
Don't joke!

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,780
The human nature is the greatest personality.

155
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll crush your charm point and I'll change it!

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,220
How is it? Does it feel good?

157
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,360
I got it! Stop it!

158
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,760
Ugh, it's like a torture.

159
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,420
Then, let's start over from the moment you wake up.

160
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,380
It's also nice and polite to stop a alarm clock.

161
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,000
I got it.

162
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,480
Is this fine?

163
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,980
That's right! If you do it, you can do it!

164
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,100
When you wake up in the morning,

165
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,600
wash your face and brush your teeth.

166
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
Turn it properly and blow it!

167
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,860
I got it!

168
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,740
Is this fine?

169
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,880
It's fine.

170
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,320
Next, let's clean the room.

171
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,260
What?

172
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,100
Clean it within 30 minutes.

173
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,040
Let's start!

174
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,420
Wait a minute!

175
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,780
You can do it anytime you feel like it, even if you want to put a futon on it!

176
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,280
Other things can be cleaned anytime you feel like it!

177
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,420
But,

178
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,060
this is more convenient for a place where you can just go back and sleep by yourself.

179
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,700
So...

180
00:07:59,700 --> 00:07:59,820
No more!

181
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,820
I got it!

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,880
I'll do it!

183
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,840
Ugh...

184
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
Ugh...

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,700
Ugh...

186
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,280
Ugh...

187
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,320
Ugh...

188
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,940
Ugh...

189
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,340
Ugh...

190
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,120
Ugh...

191
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm tired.

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
Is this fine?

193
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,520
It's fine. Then, I'll order breakfast.

194
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,980
What?

195
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,140
What?

196
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,140
It's a meal!

197
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,100
Eh?

198
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,980
Ugh...

199
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,640
What is this?

200
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,720
What's going on?

201
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,680
This is a special meal for you.

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,820
Ryo-chan's performance this morning is actually not good.

203
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,260
But, it's your first day, so it's a big service.

204
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
Ugh...

205
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,640
What?

206
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,800
I'm so tired!

207
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,780
I'm so tired!

208
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,600
Ryo-sama and Reiko-san disappeared together!

209
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,640
Where?

210
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,640
Where are you?

211
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,380
I-I'm not here!

212
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:50,500
I-I'm not here!

213
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,460
You don't have to worry about it!

214
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,420
There is nothing wrong with those two!

215
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,160
Ugh...

216
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Ugh...

217
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,780
How can you say that?

218
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,720
If Reiko-san's gurgling with the charm of a manly Ryo-sama,

219
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
What should I do?

220
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,160
What should I do?

221
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,540
You don't have to worry.

222
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Anyway, Reiko-san is gurgling with Ryo-san.

223
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,760
Ugh...

224
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
I won't forgive you for insulting my Ryo-sama!

225
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,500
I can't!

226
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,540
I can't!

227
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,440
I can't!

228
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,520
I can't!

229
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,660
I can't!

230
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:25,940
I can't!

231
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,220
It's like a car institute!

232
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,620
We're going to train you for the job!

233
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,620
Get on a bicycle and get to the starting position.

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,840
Why are you making such a fool of yourself?

235
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,660
Oh, no!

236
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,040
I got it!

237
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,620
I got it!

238
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
Damn it, Reiko!

239
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,200
Start!

240
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,280
Yes!

241
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,460
What is it?

242
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,820
Don't go near it!

243
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,160
Damn it!

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,100
It's not near, it's close!

245
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,000
If you pass the garden of Hattori's grandfather's house, it's a 5-minute short trip!

246
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,580
Don't answer me!

247
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
I got it! I got it!

248
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,520
Start over from the beginning!

249
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,160
Damn it, this guy is like a demon.

250
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,820
Oh, the limited plan is...

251
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,800
Don't go near it!

252
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,580
Hey, wait!

253
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,260
Wait!

254
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,560
Here we go!

255
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,920
There you go again!

256
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,620
Stop!

257
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
Start over from the beginning!

258
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,380
Start over! Start over! Start over!

259
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,400
That's all for today's training!

260
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,500
You'll be working at the Mogi Exhibition House this afternoon.

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,560
Now, we'll take a 30-minute lunch break.

262
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
The meal is ready for you in the office.

263
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,940
Meal time!

264
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,280
You can stand the bicycle properly in the back!

265
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,760
I got it!

266
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
I got it!

267
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm going to die if I keep this up.

268
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,800
If you think so, don't let your negative points come out.

269
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,680
Reiko, you!

270
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,620
Such a way of listening is also calculated.

271
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,580
I check every detail of your daily life.

272
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,720
If you want to eat a proper meal, do everything in your life properly.

273
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,040
Got it?

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Yes, I got it.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,460
Yes, I got it.

276
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,440
Now, we'll start the excretion training.

277
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,500
Now, we'll start the excretion training.

278
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,040
Here, this is Kamiari.

279
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,240
This is Kamiari.

280
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,580
Kamiari, I'm here for the 5-yen rice.

281
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,840
Oh, so you've always been watching this.

282
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,300
Excuse me!

283
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,900
Yes?

284
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,460
Is Kamiari Station over here?

285
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,540
Yes, it is!

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,740
What?

287
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,520
Well, turn right here and go straight to the station.

288
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,800
Hello!

289
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,360
Hello!

290
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
Excuse me, where is Kamiari Komin-kann?

291
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,880
Go 500 meters ahead.

292
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,180
Go 500 meters ahead.

293
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,120
Oh, I did it!

294
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,880
I did it!

295
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,040
I did it!

296
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,340
I'll enjoy this.

297
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,780
I'll enjoy this.

298
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Oh, it's hot.

299
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,220
It's hot.

300
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,700
It's hot.

301
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,160
Oh, it's hot.

302
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,820
Hot.

303
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,020
Hot.

304
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,720
Hot.

305
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,560
Hot.

306
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:29,740
Hot.

307
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:29,980
Hot.

308
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,040
Oh, it's hot.

309
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,240
Wait!

310
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,720
Wait!

311
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, it's hot.

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,300
Oh, it's hot.

313
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,120
Oh, it's hot.

314
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,820
Oh, it's hot.

315
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
I think it's hot.

316
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,220
OK.

317
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,840
I will do my best.

318
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:41,920
OK.

319
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,360
Let's go to the train station.

320
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,440
All right.

321
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,580
OK.

322
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,740
Let's Go Let's Don't Stop

323
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,940
This should be enough.

324
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,640
Really?

325
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,380
He's a simple man, so his alive experience will give him a chance to learn these words.

326
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,080
I bet his body would move even back in his daily life.

327
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,680
Understood. Thank you for your cooperation.

328
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,280
It was very delicious.

329
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,880
What? Why is it so dirty?

330
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,400
Oh, I see. I'm back to being a real Nico Nico Ryo.

331
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,900
That noisy demon instructor Reiko is gone.

332
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,380
I'm free and free from now on.

333
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:54,600
I can't calm down.

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,820
I'm free and free from now on.

335
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,860
Ryo-chan is cleaning.

336
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
What's wrong with her? She might have a fever.

337
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,840
Senpai...

338
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,020
How is Ryo-chan?

339
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,420
She's amazing, Reiko-san.

340
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,420
I see.

341
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,460
I understand.

342
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,600
You should watch Ryo-chan for a while.

343
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,200
See you.

344
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,920
Reiko-san, the camera is ready.

345
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,680
Thank you.

346
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
This one is ready, too.

347
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,760
Then, both of you, please come to Ryo-chan as usual.

348
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,760
Yes.

349
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,280
Sir, can you see?

350
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Yes, I can see.

351
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,640
Ryo-san will be coming soon.

352
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,980
Of course, we don't let you know about the camera.

353
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,360
You'll see his honest side.

354
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,220
Please watch it and consider the punishment one more time.

355
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,560
That's dangerous.

356
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,860
We just need to play.

357
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,060
I think it's useless.

358
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,300
Then, let's see.

359
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,840
Don't becomes fierce.

360
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,660
But, if this situation gets worse.

361
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,420
Ryo-chan would be dopo resort pneumonia.

362
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,960
Okay?

363
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,720
Okay.

364
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,780
resposta

365
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Good morning.

366
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,300
Good morning, everyone!

367
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,380
Good morning!

368
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,380
Senpai!

369
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,140
Good morning!

370
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,460
Terai!

371
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,440
Look, you have a string on your wrist.

372
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,960
Thank you!

373
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,700
Reiko, tea.

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,300
I'll put it in myself.

375
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,000
Terai, show me your schedule when I was away.

376
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,180
Okay.

377
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,840
It's at 5.

378
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,040
What?

379
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,800
Here.

380
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,080
It's okay.

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,280
I'll fix it.

382
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,220
Thank you, Ryo-san.

383
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,580
Today's business is...

384
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,840
Yes, this is Katsushikaku Kameyari.

385
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,140
I'm here before the park.

386
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,120
This file is easy to see.

387
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,500
This is the house of the fourth Nakajima Katsuhiro-san.

388
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,580
I'm sorry.

389
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,620
No, no.

390
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,940
How is it, everyone?

391
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
You might think I'm a very criminal police officer.

392
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,300
But...

393
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,940
I don't know yet.

394
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,920
Care insurance?

395
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,440
It's too complicated for an old man.

396
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,380
Huh?

397
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,540
What?

398
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,820
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

399
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,220
I think I've been in the pension.

400
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,760
What are you talking about, Ryo-san?

401
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,140
That's ridiculous.

402
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,640
What?

403
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,640
Why is the pension ridiculous?

404
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,180
The pension insurance is important, Terai!

405
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,300
I'm in it.

406
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,220
Ryo-san is not in it.

407
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,940
I...

408
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,000
Ryo-chan!

409
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,540
Are you okay, Senpai?

410
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,480
You have a blue face.

411
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,260
My...

412
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,220
My logo...

413
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,900
My savings...

414
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,160
My future...

415
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,240
The balance is zero.

416
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,600
I have a lot of money.

417
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,900
Ryo-chan!

418
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,700
I'm sorry.

419
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,400
I can't keep this up, right?

420
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,620
What to go about this...

421
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,600
·

422
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,120
·

423
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,780
·

424
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:35,840
·

425
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:35,860
·

426
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,020
·

427
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,100
·

428
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,160
·

429
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,700
·

430
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,440
·

431
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,660
·

432
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:37,700
·

433
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,020
·

434
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,720

435

·

436
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:44,820
·

437
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,600
·

438
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:45,680

439

440

441
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,440
·

442
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,740
·

443
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,280
·

444
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,760
I don't know.

445
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
If you say that, I'll be...

446
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,300
The poor man has his own family and a family he's been saving up for.

447
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,820
Come to think of it, I'm still a young man, not alone.

448
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,180
I must build a happy family and be stable.

449
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,340
However, the other person...

450
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,320
Reiko!

451
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:16,900
Yes?

452
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,080
Your pure love for me for the past week...

453
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,600
That's the love for me for you!

454
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,580
Huh? That's...

455
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,880
Please, Reiko! Marry me!

456
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,540
Marry Ryo-chan?

457
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
Ryo-sama!

458
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,000
I know it's not what you think!

459
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,780
What the hell is going on here?!

460
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,780
Maria-san, calm down!

461
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,900
What's with this man's nervousness?

462
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,200
Maybe the police is not interested.

463
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,220
What's wrong, Tonda-kun?

464
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,520
Tonda-kun, say something.

465
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,180
That's...

466
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,300
Hey!

467
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,660
What are you doing in this emergency situation?!

468
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,900
Huh?!

469
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,220
All cars moving from Katsushika.

470
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,220
A young man is standing on the roof of the Marugame Department Store in Kameari Kitaguchi.

471
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,500
Please call the police for help at the nearby patrol car.

472
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,620
Please call the police for help at the nearby patrol car.

473
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,180
Don't come any closer!

474
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,420
If you come any closer, I'll break this rope!

475
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,300
What's the situation?

476
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,420
The culprit is a high school student who is a hostage.

477
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
He was attacked after being warned of a full-fledged assault.

478
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,720
What's your request?

479
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,560
For now, it's nothing...

480
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,960
So many people gathered here...

481
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,200
It's all over...

482
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,780
If you forgive him...

483
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,120
Shut up!

484
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,960
You can't do this to me!

485
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm scared...

486
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,380
He's the only one who can't help us!

487
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,160
We have to do something!

488
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,140
At a time like this...

489
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,960
At a time like this...

490
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,840
What can we do to help him?

491
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,260
I...

492
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,060
Yes, now is the time!

493
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,780
It's time to learn from your seniors.

494
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm asking, Ryo-chan!

495
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
As always, please!

496
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
Yes, Ryo-san...

497
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,860
What...?

498
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,840
Y-you all...

499
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,440
That's...

500
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,180
Why do you guys...

501
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,080
I made up my mind to do it safely in safety.

502
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,180
Wh-what is that?

503
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
To commit such an dangerous job!

504
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,740
What is the job paid for by a public official?

505
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Why do you have to go that far with your salary?

506
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,680
Are you going to get a ticket?

507
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,340
I can't talk about it at all.

508
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,260
You're all so low.

509
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,720
Mr. Tonda, did you get a wrong education?

510
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,740
What's wrong with you, Mr. Tonda?

511
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,840
After all, I'm a police officer.

512
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,140
I can only do what a police officer can do.

513
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,100
Please don't expect it.

514
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,000
I can't answer.

515
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,100
Mr. Tonda!

516
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,400
Mr. Tonda is not the real Mr. Tonda right now!

517
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,500
Stop it, Maria.

518
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,320
I'm not in the disability insurance yet.

519
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
No, I don't like that kind of Mr. Tonda.

520
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,720
What?

521
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,440
Stop it!

522
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,780
Let's go home, Leica!

523
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:42,900
Okay!

524
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you doing?

525
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,160
Oh!

526
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Oh, yeah!

527
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,740
Oh!

528
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,320
You did well, young lady.

529
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm not worried anymore.

530
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,560
Thank you, father!

531
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm sorry, sir!

532
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,180
You idiot!

533
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,120
You let me get away with this!

534
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,260
I'm sorry!

535
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,420
Ryo!

536
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,660
You did it, Ryo!

537
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,560
That's my Ryo!

538
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,180
What's going on?

539
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,640
I'm the same as always!

540
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,080
That's right!

541
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,180
My Ryo is the same as always!

542
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,400
What do you think, everyone?

543
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,700
Ryo Tsukanki is still a person who is against the police?

544
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,280
Hmm...

545
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,760
For now...

546
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,080
This time, the punishment is reserved, so how about that, everyone?

547
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,200
Chief Ohara!

548
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,420
I just got a call from the chief.

549
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,480
It seems that Ryo's punishment has been reserved for the time being!

550
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,640
I see!

551
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,840
Is something wrong with my punishment?

552
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,160
No, it's nothing.

553
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,980
Ryo-chan, by the way, you said that you wanted to marry Reiko-san, didn't you?

554
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,240
No, it's not that!

555
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,640
I became a coward!

556
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,800
No!

557
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,560
I'm sure Ryo-san has a little bit of a grudge to Reiko-san!

558
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,160
That's why I said that!

559
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,120
Reiko, this is a misunderstanding!

560
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,260
But, the proposed Reiko-san is actually not Manzawa.

561
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,420
Eh?

562
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,580
Kei-chan!

563
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,360
Well, even so, he is a peaceful guy who doesn't know that he is about to be fired.

564
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,400
After all, Ryo-san has to be like this!

565
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,640
But, the proposed Reiko-san is actually a man.

566
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,700
If you propose to women other than me, I will not forgive you!

567
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,100
That's why you're a man!

568
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,420
Manzawa

569
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,000
Manzawa

570
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,020
Manzawa

571
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,500
Manzawa

572
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,400
Manzawa

573
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,080
Manzawa

574
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,820
Manzawa

575
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,960
Manzawa

576
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,400
Manzawa

577
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:53,380
Manzawa

578
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:00,580
A politician with a big face and a blue aunt above his eyes

579
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,020
Turn around and look at that corner

580
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,660
You can see everyone

581
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,200
There is a wall there, there must be a wall

582
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,300
Come on everyone to our town

583
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,440
Thank you!

584
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,240
Eww! It's bad!

585
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,960
Why is this Kusaya Natto Ramen with a blue cheese flavor

586
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,080
ranked first in the ranking program?

587
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,480
I can't trust the ranking of others

588
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,880
In this case, I will decide the true ranking!

589
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,140
Next time, the final ranking!

590
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,660
Please look forward to it!

591
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,600
There is a wall there, there must be a wall

592
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,700
Come on everyone to our town

593
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you!
