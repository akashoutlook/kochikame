1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,800
The Central Area of Tokyo

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,420
The central area of Tokyo.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,380
The area that started out as Tokyo from the Sumida River has been called Tsukuda Island for a long time.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
The Sumida River is divided into three sections called the Harumi-unga.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,740
Originally, it was an island as its name suggests.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,520
After that, it was built and became a direct extension of the northern Tsukishima and the southern Ishikawa Islands.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,720
The current official name is Tsukuda Icho-me.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,140
Tsukuda Island has changed a lot.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,960
I've read in books that this area used to be a boat dock for the Wata-shibune, right?

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,960
Yes, this is before Tsukuda-ohashi was built.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,620
Wata-shibune is the one that often appears in historical dramas, right?

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,220
It's a little different, but it's similar.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,500
It's a little different, but it's similar.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,320
From Tsukuda to Akashi-cho on the other side, both ends of the Tsukuda-ohashi were the wata-shibune dock.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:10,100
The steam ship pulled the ship and it was a four or five minute boat trip, but it was just used well.

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,340
Huh?

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,360
Come to think of it, I remembered.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,340
There's a water gate over there, right?

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,680
It wasn't there in the past, but they could put a boat out on the Sumida River right away.

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,980
The back of Tsukuda Island is a boat dock, and I used to play there a lot.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,200
I made a boat with Tonpei, Chinkichi and the three of us. It's a pretty serious one.

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,720
Chinkichi, be careful with that ship on the right.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,840
I'm fine.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
Engine start!

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,140
The Sumida River is pretty heavy.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,580
When the ship passes, the waves come into the boat dock and the wata-shibune is shaken.

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,880
It's good. You can ride it.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,020
It's beautiful.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,040
That was fun.

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,880
Huh?

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,680
No way.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,140
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,640
That onbora boat.

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,500
Huh?

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,440
Yattokomaru?

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,600
That's a strange name.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
Do you remember anything, Senpai?

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,600
Uh, uh...

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,700
When watching TV,

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,880
make the room bright and look away.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,560
Come to me, you poor thing.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,020
Look at the blue sky.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,880
The white clouds.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,300
It'll be alright eventually.

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:11,140
Come to me, you jobless guy.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
Look.

49
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:18,860
Look.

50
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,960
The red clouds are burning.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
It'll be alright eventually.

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,580
You get it, right?

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,500
You get it, you get it?

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,360
Don't say anything.

55
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,080
I won't say a thing!

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,860
Leave now.

57
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,340
Oh, of course.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,440
Ryo-chan...

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,600
I won't say a thing.

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,120
It'll be alright eventually.

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,060
The monster dragged the grasps of this island's air.

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,740
I got you.

63
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,680
It'll be alright, Yattokomaru,

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,860
who lost your memories,

65
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,540
It was a powerful movie that connected three screens.

66
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,360
Especially the scene of the storm falling on the raft was amazing.

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,740
When I watched it in the front seat, it seemed to be a water splash.

68
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,720
It was amazing!

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,200
It was very powerful.

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,520
Let's try our boat trip not only around Tsukuda Island, but also on a real adventure.

71
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,380
Adventure trip?

72
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,920
What are you going to do, Kankichi?

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,220
We're going to go down the Sumida River.

74
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,580
The Sumida River?

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,800
Starting from Senju Bridge, we'll go to Suijin Bridge, Shirahige Bridge, Kototoi Bridge, Azuma Bridge,

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,280
Komagata Bridge, Umae Bridge, Kuramae Bridge, Ryogoku Bridge, Kiyosu Bridge,

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,540
and then we'll cross the Eitai Bridge and go down to Tsukuda Island.

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,400
Wow! It's like a big adventure!

79
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,680
Sounds great! Let's do it!

80
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,020
All three of us were excited.

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,640
Of course, we didn't know what would get in the way, so we kept it a secret from our parents.

82
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,900
Thank you, sir!

83
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,260
Hello!

84
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,980
Oh, be careful!

85
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,780
Well, here we go.

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,580
There!

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,540
Yahoo!

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Departure!

89
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,660
Yo!

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,620
Full speed ahead!

91
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,900
Go to Hokuhokusei!

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,360
Kankichi, what's Hokuhokusei?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Um, it's the other way around.

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,680
That's right.

95
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,000
It's fine. Don't worry about the details.

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
The atmosphere will be ruined.

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,440
Right.

98
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,020
Let's go on an adventure!

99
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,560
Let's go!

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,220
Hey!

101
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,620
Let's go!

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,900
We're almost at Suijin Bridge.

103
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Ah, if we turn this curve, we'll be there.

104
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,760
Right!

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,500
That's grain Youngman!

106
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,280
I'll show you some.

107
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Hey!

108
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,240
Hey!

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,740
What's that?

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,220
Yeah, yeah!

111
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,600
How about you?

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,320
Awesome, right?

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,480
Huh?

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,200
That's sick!

115
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,700
The butt, pass! Pass!

116
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,160
What!

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,020
Think again!

118
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,200
Help me!

119
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,640
Well, let's get going.

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,040
Ta-dah!

121
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,220
Wow! You brought that?

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,520
What did you bring?

123
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,340
I'm the second submarine.

124
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm the South Pole observation ship, Sawyer.

125
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,700
All right. Let's get them into the water.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
All right.

127
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,220
Wet.

128
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,380
All right. All right.

129
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,080
Kankichi's Yamato is really powerful.

130
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,560
It looks like a real one.

131
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,300
My South Pole observation ship, Sawyer, is pretty good too.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,620
Wow! It's so cool!

133
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,660
It's them!

134
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,980
Hey, you!

135
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,520
That's a one-shot!

136
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,880
Yeah!

137
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,480
Stop it!

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,420
Stop it!

139
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,260
Stop it!

140
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,320
All right. We're in the bridge.

141
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
Let's get the ship back.

142
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,040
Hurry up!

143
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
Damn it!

144
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,500
The 46-centimeter cannon is broken.

145
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,880
My radar was damaged.

146
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,960
The ship's rudder is...

147
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,580
Come on!

148
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,820
Over there!

149
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,240
I won't let you off!

150
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,700
What's wrong with you?

151
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,020
Why the heck did you do that?

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,460
You're in trouble!

153
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,280
And then he found you.

154
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm gonna see you in the next video!

155
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,060
Okay, boss!

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
I hit him.

157
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,680
He's in trouble!

158
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,200
You dangerously soy-

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
Hey, Kankichi.

160
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,160
Sao.

161
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,660
Hm?

162
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,760
Ah!

163
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,980
Sao, give it back!

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,620
Give it back!

165
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,420
Give it back!

166
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
What should we do?

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,340
There's no one else to replace me.

168
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,620
Are you going to break it by hand?

169
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Huh?

170
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,280
Kankichi!

171
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,660
I ran! I'm going to crash!

172
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,120
There's a lot of heavy water!

173
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,400
Which is heavier?

174
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,820
That's the water over there!

175
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,060
It doesn't matter, just avoid it!

176
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm going to crash!

177
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,500
Kankichi!

178
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,540
The water is...

179
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,780
Ah, there was a compass and a map in there.

180
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,340
Give it up.

181
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,300
You can't go back now.

182
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,120
It's like an adventure to lose your luggage on the way.

183
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,280
But...

184
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,580
You have to help each other in times like this.

185
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,000
That's what adventure is.

186
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
Everyone, give me my luggage!

187
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,240
Everyone?

188
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm the only one left.

189
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,860
Um...

190
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,940
Water bottle, right?

191
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,260
Uh, chocolate plate, right?

192
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,500
And four rice balls.

193
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,680
What?

194
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,180
You're just eating.

195
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,240
Because eating is important, right?

196
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,140
Well, the rest is in the toolbox.

197
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,020
Ah, this one was also washed away.

198
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,100
A nail and a tonkatsu.

199
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,100
Uh, and a small sword.

200
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,180
Ah...

201
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,120
Oh, it's delicious!

202
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,140
There's only a sushi restaurant in the far end, so the route is different.

203
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,340
Stop it!

204
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,480
A family eats regular rice!

205
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,880
By the way, there's only one left.

206
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,560
It's an adventure, so we have to share everything.

207
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,340
I'll share three.

208
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,160
Yeah, I'll do it.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
It's me!

210
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,440
It's me!

211
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Kankichi is not good at mathematics, right?

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,460
You're the same, aren't you?

213
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,700
Stop it, you two!

214
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,960
Ah!

215
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,340
Ah!

216
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,300
Ah!

217
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,240
Ah!

218
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,240
Ah!

219
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,700
Ah!

220
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,400
Ah!

221
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:53,540
Ah!

222
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:53,980
Ah!

223
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,700
Ah!

224
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
Ah!

225
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,940
Rice balls...

226
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,460
It's not my fault.

227
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,400
Well, don't be disappointed.

228
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,220
It seems that this is a real adventure trip.

229
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,580
Yeah!

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,180
It's transparent over there.

231
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,460
Huh...

232
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,980
Huh...

233
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,480
Where are we?

234
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,320
Well, we just crossed the Koto Toibashi bridge, so we haven't reached half of it yet.

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,820
There's still that much left?

236
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,600
Hey, don't drink so much by yourself.

237
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,820
It's fine! It's my water!

238
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,080
Now it's everyone's water!

239
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't play around! Give it back!

240
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,500
No!

241
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,020
Stop it, you two!

242
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,100
Stop it!

243
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm hungry.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,700
I'm hungry.

245
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,520
I just ate one rice ball.

246
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm hungry.

247
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,440
Wait!

248
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,920
Tompei, you have to take your chocolate for the best time.

249
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,540
What do you mean, for the best time?

250
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,420
By the way, it's the best time.

251
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,440
That's what happens on an adventure.

252
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,580
Ouch.

253
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,700
Ouch.

254
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,960
I should have brought some fishing tools.

255
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,860
I have a small sword, so I can handle it.

256
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,920
Fish? I like chocolate.

257
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,240
Don't say that. I want to eat it more and more.

258
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,820
What are you doing, Kankichi?

259
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,780
I'm diving to get some fish.

260
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
An adventure is something you can do by yourself.

261
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,000
Kankichi, are you serious?

262
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,640
Stop it.

263
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
It's fine.

264
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,540
I'm fine.

265
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,260
Kankichi!

266
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,520
He really jumped in.

267
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,480
He hasn't come up yet.

268
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,540
Isn't it a little too long?

269
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,640
That's right.

270
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Kinkichi, Tompei!

271
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,800
Kankichi!

272
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,600
It's huge.

273
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,780
I've never seen such a big eel.

274
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,620
Yeah, it's the owner of the river.

275
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,500
Yeah, it's the owner of the river.

276
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,720
If you grill it on a river, it might get a punishment.

277
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,480
That's right.

278
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,960
I'll return it to the river.

279
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,980
That's the best.

280
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,460
Yeah.

281
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,120
Take care.

282
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,620
If we grow up, we'll meet again.

283
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,620
If we grow up, we'll meet again.

284
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,800
Let's eat some chocolate.

285
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,320
Let's eat some chocolate.

286
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,400
Let's eat some chocolate.

287
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,760
Let's eat some chocolate.

288
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,400
Let's eat some chocolate.

289
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,020
Oh, you're full, Kankichi.

290
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,400
I don't have that much chocolate.

291
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,640
You're full, Kankichi.

292
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,140
You're full, Kankichi.

293
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,400
Oh, you're full, Kankichi.

294
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,820
Oh...

295
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,940
Oh stay...

296
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,840
You're hungry.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,480
When?

298
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,760
Oh, that's right.

299
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:56,780
I'm hungry.

300
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,160
.

301
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,460
Ah, stop it.

302
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:06,940
I'm hungry.

303
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,740
Until tomorrow, I'll take it to Kankichi.

304
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:09,860
I'm thirsty.

305
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,180
I'm thirsty.

306
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
I want to drink Ramune.

307
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,600
Let's quit.

308
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,940
What's wrong, Tompei?

309
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,580
You can't quit.

310
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm sick of it.

311
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,580
I'm hungry.

312
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,820
You've decided once.

313
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
It's meaningless if you don't finish the adventure.

314
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,580
What's the point of it?

315
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,720
What?

316
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,500
Say it again.

317
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,680
You're a bastard.

318
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,860
What?

319
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,660
Stop it.

320
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,720
You're always like that when you're in trouble.

321
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,500
I see.

322
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,380
I'll decide when I'm in trouble.

323
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,780
Who wants to quit?

324
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes.

325
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,300
Who wants to continue until the end?

326
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,120
Yes.

327
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Who's the new captain?

328
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,580
I'll do it until the end.

329
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,080
I see.

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,060
You're on an adventure, but you're quitting.

331
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Look.

332
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,940
But.

333
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,900
But?

334
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,600
You're too nosy.

335
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:07,840
I don't know.

336
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,980
I wish I had a better way to run.

337
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,700
Even if you say that, it's not because you have an engine.

338
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,800
You have no choice but to leave it to the flow.

339
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,140
Huh?

340
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,140
I've come up with a good idea.

341
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,100
Hey!

342
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,360
Huh?

343
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
What's this pile of garbage?

344
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,720
What are you going to do with this?

345
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm going to make a fire.

346
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,320
It's a fire-fighting place, right?

347
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm going to pile up the newspaper.

348
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,800
I see.

349
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,920
But I need seaweed.

350
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,260
Here is this crushed rice ball.

351
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,560
I see!

352
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,040
It's done.

353
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,420
Right?

354
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,500
Wow!

355
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,880
We did it!

356
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,660
We made it to Kiosu Bridge!

357
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,800
Now we just need to cross Etaibashi and we'll be there soon!

358
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
The sky is getting more and more suspicious.

359
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,060
We'll be in for a heavy rain.

360
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,080
Here it comes!

361
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,800
Whoa!

362
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,520
What are you doing?

363
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,780
Koukichi!

364
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,760
Hold on tight so you don't fall!

365
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,660
Koukichi! That's Etaibashi!

366
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,140
That means...

367
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,200
Fukuda Island is to the right!

368
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,820
No! The wind is too strong!

369
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,440
There's no other way!

370
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,160
The wind is too strong!

371
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,540
No! I can't make it!

372
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,300
I'm going to crash!

373
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Whoa!

374
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,980
My mountain!

375
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,340
Hey, come on!

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,420
Hey, Etaibashi!

377
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,540
Ayuibashi!

378
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,700
A little longer before the river tips off!

379
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Don't!

380
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,040
Ah no, I'm running out of force!

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,800
Daddy, help me!

382
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,940
Ah!

383
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:01,960
I got stuck!

384
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't know where I put my legs!

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,300
Come on, Koukichi!

386
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,400
I can't get up!

387
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,300
"Mosto — Numberlithic

388
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,200
"Mosto — Numberlithic

389
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,900
"Mosto — Numberlithic

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
"Mosto — Numberlithic

391
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,780
"Mosto — Numberlithic

392
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,480
It's getting cold.

393
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,580
What's in the world?

394
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,200
Come on.

395
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,460
Absolutely nothing!

396
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,000
Guys, can you just go back in there?

397
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,620
Damn, it's a storm.

398
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,960
I didn't tell you anything about the weather forecast.

399
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,740
What are you talking about?

401
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,380
Thanks to you, we had a great adventure.

402
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,340
That's right. There's nothing to apologize for.

403
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,440
This boat was 60 kilometers away.

404
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
That's right.

405
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,160
It was much faster than the truck at the store.

406
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,640
I'll tell you about this when I get married and have children.

407
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,620
Are you married?

408
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,300
Who do you like?

409
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,580
I know.

410
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,520
You hate me, don't you?

411
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,260
I don't want to tell you.

412
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,020
Then let's say it together.

413
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,440
It's a secret between the three of us.

414
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,380
Okay, let's do it.

415
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,380
♪ The game of finger-cutting lies. ♪

416
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,360
♪ If you don't do it, you'll get a thousand needles. ♪

417
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,680
But it's really hard to get a thousand needles.

418
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,740
I can't drink it.

419
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,080
It doesn't matter.

420
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,600
It's about your favorite child.

421
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,720
Then let's say it.

422
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,220
One, two.

423
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,340
The three-class Momoyo-chan!

424
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,280
What?

425
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,920
Are you all the same?

426
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,920
Because it's cute.

427
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,980
It's gentle.

428
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,300
But Momoyo-chan is a young lady.

429
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,100
Will we be married?

430
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,780
It's stupid.

431
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,400
We're like this now.

432
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,640
But when we grow up, we don't know how great we'll be.

433
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,660
I see.

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,340
I may be a space pilot.

435
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,080
I'm a rich man anyway.

436
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
I'm the captain of the Earth Defense Forces.

437
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,800
That's not true.

438
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,680
Then, I'll tell Momoyo-chan to marry me.

439
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,860
It's a ship.

440
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,760
It's coming here.

441
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,980
Is it a vessel?

442
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,820
Is it a vessel?

443
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,560
Is it a ship?

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
Hey!

445
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,060
Is it a vessel?

446
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,620
Is it a ship?

447
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,580
It's flying!

448
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,240
It's a ship!

449
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,100
Is it a ship?

450
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,500
Is it?

451
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,420
Is it a ship?

452
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,820
Kankichi!

453
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,080
Kankichi!

454
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,900
Kankichi!

455
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,180
I thought I was going to die...

456
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,540
Kankichi!

457
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,600
I'm glad...

458
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,260
Tonpei, Chinkichi, I'm glad you're safe!

459
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,220
Get him!

460
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Get him?

461
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,880
Didn't you say, get him?

462
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Man, he's got a lot of fish in his mouth.

463
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,720
Man, he's got a lot of fish in his mouth.

464
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,660
So that's this boat, huh?

465
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,140
Yeah, I guess.

466
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,080
It's been decades since he got caught.

467
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,780
That old man might have died already.

468
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:55,980
That old man might have died already.

469
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,320
Ah! He's out!

470
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,640
He's out!

471
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,380
What's going on?

472
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,540
What's going on?

473
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,400
What's going on?

474
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,760
I'm alive.

475
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,860
Really?

476
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,600
But you're still the same as you were back then.

477
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
But you're still the same as you were back then.

478
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,160
So you're the same old man.

479
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,840
So you're the same old man.

480
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,000
How old are you?

481
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,560
I've been doing this for about 40 years.

482
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,060
I've been doing this for about 40 years.

483
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,300
I'm glad you're doing well.

484
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,320
It's just a coincidence.

485
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,560
No way.

486
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,260
I found something in the ocean after that.

487
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,260
Ah!

488
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,040
It's mine!

489
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,660
It's my Yamato I lost back then!

490
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,740
Wow, Lisa!

491
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,560
That's good, Senpai.

492
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,580
It's my Yamato.

493
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,180
Yeah, that's for sure.

494
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,000
It's this one!

495
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,140
Good, good!

496
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,120
Engine start!

497
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,520
Engine start!

498
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,560
I love the sound of the waves!

499
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,600
I love the sound of the waves!

500
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,400
I feel so jealous of him sometimes.

501
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,360
I feel so jealous of him sometimes.

502
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,380
You're right.

503
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,960
He's as long-lived as me.

504
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,000
Too long.

505
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,500
No, I...

506
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,920
Too long.

507
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,340
Too long.

508
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:17,860
Too long.

509
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,660
Good.

510
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
It's gone.

511
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,840
Ah, the shadows are still there from yesterday

512
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,500
So even if it rains today, tomorrow will be sunny again

513
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,820
I can believe in that day

I'm heading for tomorrow with a nice breath

Don't get sick, I'll do what I have to do

523
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,540
With a cute breath

524
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,100
What's hard to understand

525
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,240
Is the war I want to show

526
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,600
It's better than just looking back

527
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,620
It's better than just looking back

528
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,840
Hey, this is bad!

529
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,960
The shakuri won't stop!

530
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,640
If this continues, my life will be in danger!

531
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,780
Someone! Stop it!

532
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,620
Next time!

533
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,260
Shakuri Panic!

534
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm counting on you!

535
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Over there is Kameari

536
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,100
Ah, I'm sure it's Kameari

537
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,740
Everyone, come to our town

538
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,840
Thank you!
