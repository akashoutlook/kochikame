1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,640
I look up at the sunset floating in the middle of the river

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,480
I kick the pebble and fly to the end

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,000
I wonder if I'm going to the taiko that I used to jog

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,860
I laughed at the fact that it was still a cake

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,460
It's only for the sake of winning even if I'm a good man somewhere

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,300
The cityscape that doesn't change even if it's evil is kinder than the night

8
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,480
The sun is already setting because the crows are crying

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm a grilled chicken

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,460
I'm a grilled chicken

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm a grilled chicken

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,300
Tomorrow's the same age, I'll fuck you up

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm a grilled chicken

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,080
But I don't care, I've changed

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,900
I'll fuck you up

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,320
Reiko's Cute Prince

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,460
Senpai, you're late.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,860
Really? The time for the replacement has already passed.

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,880
The king must be selling oil somewhere again.

20
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,100
What a hopeless guy.

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,520
Yay! I'm here!

22
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,640
I barely made it.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,160
You're late!

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,560
I told you to keep the time!

25
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,940
I saw the sunset in Nagagawa,

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,140
and when I kicked a pebble, it flew to the sandalwood.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
That's a terrible excuse.

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,520
It's a shame.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,800
Enough! You idiot!

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,060
Well, excuse us.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
I'll take care of the rest.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,580
Be careful.

33
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
This way, please.

34
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,320
Someone is coming.

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,920
If you keep following me, I'll show you this is the way.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,540
Thank you for watching!

37
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,520
Please subscribe if you enjoy the film!

*phone ringing*

45
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,500
Who's there?

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,960
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
Are you lost?

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Are you lost?

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,780
Who are you?

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't bother me!

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,400
Hey, aren't you hungry?

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,820
*phone ringing*

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm not hungry!

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,960
*phone ringing*

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,340
You must be hungry.

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm not hungry!

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,840
*phone ringing*

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,400
You don't have to force yourself.

59
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm not forcing myself.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,320
*phone ringing*

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,120
Come here.

62
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,800
You'll catch a cold if you stay here.

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,040
*phone ringing*

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,940
Don't worry.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
*phone ringing*

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,660
*phone ringing*

67
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,100
*phone ringing*

68
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
*phone ringing*

69
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,880
*phone ringing*

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280

*phone ringing*

74
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,520
Do you like it?

75
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,000
*phone ringing*

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,380
*phone ringing*

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,260
It's very delicious.

78
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,540
*phone ringing continues.

79
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,020
What's the matter?

80
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:24,340
Eh? No, I'll say something funny. I'm Akimoto Reiko, a police officer. Don't worry.

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm Jilba, Jilba Castanet.

82
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,160
We'll reward you with a reward. No need to hold back.

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,960
No need to thank me. But what are you doing there?

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,520
...Huh?

85
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,140
I'll take what I like.

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,360
You must be exhausted. Let's let him sleep for now.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,560
......

88
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,380
I have a bad feeling about this.

89
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,980
......

90
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,720
...

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,740
...

92
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,820
......

93
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,300
So?

94
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,060
Kurokawa

95
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,960
Don't hesitate against illegal intruders!

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,100
I won't hold back.

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,560
It's so noisy, but it won't happen.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
It's not just fat, but has a nerve like Ryo-chan.

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
But why did you aim at this kid?

100
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,600
-The

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,020
Then, the suspicious person entered Reiko-san's room aiming at this kid?

102
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,920
Yes, that's right.

103
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,440
What the hell is going on?

104
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,620
Hey, why are you dressed like that?

105
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,900
Is it a cosplay of the prince?

106
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,720
It's a fake!

107
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,400
A fake?

108
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,940
It's a cosplay of the prince's cosplay.

109
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,660
The prince of the 17th generation of the Ylva Castanet.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,600
Huh?

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,340
The Rumba Rumba Kingdom? Is there such a country?

112
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,020
Eh?

113
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,060
I've heard of it.

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,960
The country is small, but it's a very rich country with the rich countries of the diamonds and rubies.

115
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,760
Why did such a prince come to Japan alone?

116
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,880
The prince of the 17th generation of the Ylva Castanet.

117
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,920
The prince of the 17th generation of the Ylva Castanet.

118
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,820
The prince of the 17th generation of the Ylva Castanet.

119
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,320
He was caught up in the girl's affair of a show.

120
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,460
In short, he decided to escape from this country that he wanted to go to.

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,740
He was separated from the sheep and took the count's property.

122
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,240
I've never seen anything like this.

123
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,400
Demon!

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,960
Why are you like this?

125
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
These are horse heads.

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
I am Mambo, the man with the collar.

127
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,980
I am active as a police pig.

128
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,980
Now you know about me, right?

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,180
Then, I will feed you from now on.

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I will protect the world and fulfill my wishes.

131
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,160
Aren't you happy?

132
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,140
Mambo seems to be very attached to Sochi.

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
I will appoint Sochi as Mambo's foster parent.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,220
What?

135
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,340
I like Sochi.

136
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,740
So I will appoint her as my wife.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,580
Wife?

138
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,580
She proposed to Reiko, even though she is a child.

139
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,420
There are many diamonds, rubies and sapphires.

140
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,020
How many diamonds are there?

141
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,600
Hundreds of millions.

142
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,040
Hot!

143
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,460
Hot!

144
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,400
This is a diamond called "Stone of the Star" which is passed down to the Rumba Rumba family.

145
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,960
You can take it as a dowry for your wife.

146
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,620
I am happy!

147
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,160
Not you!

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,560
Senior!

149
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,080
If I can get it, I can marry her!

150
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,940
Um, Prince, may I?

151
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Yes, you can.

152
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,060
I have a request.

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,400
I will refuse.

154
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,340
What?

155
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,140
What?

156
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,780
Why?

157
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,820
You don't deserve to be the queen of the world.

158
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,080
Or you are not married.

159
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,340
Then...

160
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,780
No, I am not.

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,700
Marriage and love are not related to money.

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,980
What?

163
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,920
No!

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
Money is everything in the world!

165
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,080
What are you saying, Ryo?

166
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,080
Get out of the way!

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,420
Get out of the way!

168
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,580
Get out!

169
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,440
Now, Prince, don't take the side like these people..

170
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,960
Let's play a game.

171
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Ryo?

172
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,020
No, no, no way!

173
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,800
Now, here you go, Prince.

174
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,240
Hey..

175
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,180
A successful man can change his personality easily.

176
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,700
Wait a minute.

177
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,360
I will give you an example.

178
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,820
We'll have to find something good.

179
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,760
Understood, Waltz-Aniiki.

180
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
Target has been captured.

181
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,680
Alright, let's launch.

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,980
Let's launch.

183
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,480
Can you hear me?

184
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,960
S-Shut up.

185
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
You want to see Tokyo?

186
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,300
Well, I came all the way to Japan.

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,220
You're hiding yourself in the middle of nowhere.

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,220
But you shouldn't be going out like this.

189
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,540
Here.

190
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,980
Ah! Leave everything to me!

191
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,580
Yeah, take good care of it.

192
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,940
You're a prince, aren't you?

193
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,860
I don't know what to do now.

194
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,140
It's alright. I'll go with you.

195
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,900
Kei-chan, wait here for some time.

196
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,960
Understood.

197
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,180
Be careful.

198
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,740
Take care of yourself.

199
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,400
First you should go to the taisha-kuten shop in Shimamoto.

200
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,400
Sounds good.

201
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,080
It's a good chance to take the prince to the Rumba Rumba Kingdom.

202
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,000
We can get a lot of thanks from the Botanobar Palace.

203
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,380
Let's get going.

204
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,500
Right.

205
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,340
3.

206
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,160
What are you doing?

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,560
Cheese!

208
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,380
Alright!

209
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
He hasn't become a single man, eh?

210
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,560
Wait for a chance!

211
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,780
Wait a minute!

212
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,920
This is the famous Yagiri-no-watashi.

213
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,920
Please come this way.

214
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,480
Wait a minute!

215
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,560
Did you get caught?

216
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,860
Prince!

217
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:04,880
Prince!

218
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Take this!

219
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,720
Prince!

220
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,080
Someone!

221
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,120
Don't come up!

222
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,840
Prince!

223
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,480
Reiko!

224
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,060
Hold on tight!

225
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,780
Prince!

226
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,540
Are you all right?

227
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,520
Yes.

228
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,740
Are you all right?

229
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,080
Reiko, they're after the prince!

230
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,720
Even so, they did it in a flashy way!

231
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,480
Why don't you practice?

232
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,500
Prince, I'll take care of it.

233
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,720
If you give it to Ryo-chan, it's the last time!

234
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,980
Don't say that!

235
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,900
Prince, I'll take care of it.

236
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,640
I'm glad no one got hurt.

237
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,780
Well, well.

238
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,360
Well, where should we go next?

239
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,580
Oh, that's right!

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Let's go to a place where adults can play!

241
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,580
Adults play?

242
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,720
Yay!

243
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,040
I made it!

244
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,160
What do you mean, adults play?

245
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,500
I made it!

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,060
I failed again!

247
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,680
Alright!

248
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,000
Next, let's bet on this horse.

249
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,860
Number 6, Rumbatango.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,540
I like the name.

251
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,240
No, no!

252
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,700
That's a big-blooded candidate!

253
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,700
Alright!

254
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,320
Use this.

255
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,000
You can win with this.

256
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,000
Prince!

257
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,900
Are you sure about that?

258
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,380
Prince?

259
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, I can't!

260
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,800
I can't!

261
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,840
No matter how much money I collect, I can't win with this!

262
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,220
I won't even buy this racing car.

263
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,340
What are you talking about?

264
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,720
Prince, I don't like you.

265
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,800
You can't solve anything with money, you know?

266
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,060
You're right.

267
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,200
I want you to know that there are more important things than money in the world.

268
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,500
Shut up!

269
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I don't want to hear any more nonsense!

270
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,340
Oh, Prince!

271
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,000
Hey, wait!

272
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,860
Hey!

273
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,080
Hehehehe...

274
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,940
Have you found it?

275
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,820
Your master is a troublemaker!

276
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,600
Boo! Boo! Boo!

277
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,080
Kukukukukuku...

278
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,640
Boo!

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,800
Huh?

280
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,760
Hmm?

281
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,340
Oh!

282
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,560
Hehehe...

283
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,480
Ah!

284
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:49,160
Heheh, it went well, didn't it, Walz-aniki?

285
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,360
There's no doubt in the strategy you've set up, Walz-sama.

286
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,540
All that's left is to put the prince on the ship we're leaving on tonight, and the mission is complete.

287
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,700
Prince, please be patient for a while.

288
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,780
Hmph!

289
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,880
Kukukukukuku...

290
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Pull yourself together, Manpo! You're the police of the Lumba Lumba Kingdom, aren't you?

291
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,200
Bwee! Bwee! Bwee! Bwee! Bwee! Bwee!

292
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,540
What's wrong?

293
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,940
What's bothering you?

294
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,180
Senpai! Reiko-san! It's bad!

295
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,400
What's wrong, Kei-chan?

296
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,960
It seems that an international sniper has invaded Japan after targeting Prince Dilba!

297
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,120
Eh?

298
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,900
An international sniper has killed him?

299
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,760
Yes! That famous Fuga-13!

300
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,640
Fire! Fire! Fire!

301
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,040
Chase them! Chase them!

302
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,620
I'm going to put them down no matter what!

303
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,900
That is me, Fuga-13!

304
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,360
Don't stand behind me!

305
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,280
Fire! Fire! Fire!

306
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,040
It's already this late...

307
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,520
Machi, let's change!

308
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,480
What are you doing?!

309
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,100
Machi, look! The prince is running away!

310
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Idiot. What are you doing, idiot?

311
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,100
This song is...

312
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,060
Fuga-13!

313
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,060
If you're here, that means...

314
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,160
Right. Let's change the plan.

315
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,240
We're not going to catch the prince.

316
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,720
I'm going to kill him.

317
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,540
You guys are laughing boxes.

318
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,320
Waltz-aniki!

319
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,940
I'm hungry...

320
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,200
Huh?

321
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,640
What do you think of this red bean?

322
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,440
It's even got a tail.

323
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,480
You there! Give it to the world!

324
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,000
What the hell are you talking about?!

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,940
This guy is mine!

326
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,380
I'll give you a bow.

327
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,640
You bastard!

328
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,720
Don't eat things because you want a bow!

329
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,980
You're going to die!

330
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,020
You little...

331
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,760
Ah!

332
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm hungry...

333
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,680
I'm hungry...

334
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm hungry...

335
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm hungry...

336
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm hungry...

337
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,120
Give me a fattie!

338
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,880
I'll give you a fattie!

339
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,540
I'll give you a fattie!

340
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,560
I'll give you a fattie...

341
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,340
Give me a fattie!

342
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,000
What's the fattie?

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,740
What the hell is this?

344
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,520
Finally, you're actually displeased.

345
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:42,960
When I was little, you were a little handsome, too.

346
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,260
Turned out different.

347
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,000
I...

348
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,720
Uh...

349
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,060
JIGGA! The world is money! Money is everything!

350
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,580
That man is living by mistake.

351
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,580
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

352
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,540
Chase me! Chase me!

353
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,920
Alright! Now I can get even the star drops that the prince has!

354
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,880
Here!

355
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,180
Hurry up, Manpo! The prince is in danger!

356
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,320
There's no doubt that he was here.

357
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,660
He should be nearby.

358
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
This way!

359
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,520
Wait!

360
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,820
Who's there?

361
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,940
Now!

362
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,040
There he is.

363
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,540
Prince!

364
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,420
Oh, no! There's that man again!

365
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,880
And now!

366
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,320
I can't stand it!

367
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:17,180
Brrrr! Brrrr!

368
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,440
Fire, catch me!

369
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,800
Shizuku Hoshino!

370
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,500
Where did you go, Shizuku Hoshino?!

371
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,540
Mambo!

372
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,060
I wanted to see you!

373
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,960
Hiya.

374
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,300
Prince!

375
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,060
Reiko!

376
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,760
Watch out!

377
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,080
I'm sorry!

378
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm going to arrest you!

379
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,500
You're safe now, Reiko!

380
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,820
Ryo!

381
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,620
Prince, are you hurt?

382
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,580
I...I was wrong.

383
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,620
Ryo!

384
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,120
Prince, you must be hungry.

385
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,600
No, Ryo.

386
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm glad you're fine, Prince.

387
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,180
Thanks for your hard work.

388
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,260
Today was all thanks to Reiko.

389
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,300
Prince!

390
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,720
Prince!

391
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,820
I'm glad you're safe!

392
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,120
Reiko, you're the butler's servant.

393
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,640
I'm pleased to see you.

394
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,380
All the servants of the Bossa Nova have been arrested.

395
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,240
I see.

396
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm relieved.

397
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,640
I can go back to the Kingdom of Lumba Lumba.

398
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,960
Now, everyone,

399
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,500
I would like to greet Prince Jilba Castanet, the 17th Emperor.

400
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,420
Today,

401
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,480
I would like to thank you for attending my farewell party.

402
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,700
The friendship between Japan and the Kingdom of Lumba Lumba will never end.

403
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,680
I...

404
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,440
No, I, Jilba Castanet,

405
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,020
although it was a short time,

406
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,260
I learned something important that I will never forget in my next stay in Japan.

407
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,640
When I return home,

408
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,540
I will remember this valuable experience,

409
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,120
and I will swear to be a great king that will be admired by all the people.

410
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,000
Then, I, Prince,

411
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,440
will shake hands with everyone

412
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,220
and say goodbye to you all.

413
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,460
Reiko...

414
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,380
Prince, take this.

415
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Be a wonderful king.

416
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,840
Yup.

417
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,520
Yep.

418
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
It's like a long- parfume day.

419
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,960
Long-personbel day?

420
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,840
Huh?

421
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,060
Oh, it's Mambo.

422
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,460
Were youторовr in an airplane?

423
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,420
We're ready to take the JetBlueJet rumahol to Nakagawa straightaway!

424
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,940
We're going to deliver Mambo to the place.

425
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,020
Let's go!

426
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,060
We are going to the Lumba Lumba King's house on a holiday this time!

427
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,200
It was after the rain that someone called me

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,380
I looked back and walked

429
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,700
I reached out to my mom

430
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:06,920
I felt a strange feeling at that time

431
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,680
So I walked on the black roadside of Ake-do-gai

432
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,300
I saw it

433
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:25,120
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgot

434
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,680
A wise politician with a great face

435
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,040
And a blue aunt above his eyes

436
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,520
Turn around and look at that corner

437
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,220
You will meet everyone

438
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,360
There is a turtle

439
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,740
There must be a turtle

440
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,840
Everyone, come to our town

441
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,660
Let's go!

442
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,520
There is a turtle

443
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,940
There must be a turtle

444
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,920
Everyone, come to our town

445
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,000
Thank you!

446
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,620
I'm hungry!

447
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,660
Let me eat something!

448
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
I can eat anything!

449
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,440
Is it sushi, grilled meat, crab?

450
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,860
What? Strawberry?

451
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,500
Will a big man's stomach swell with such a thing?

452
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Wait a minute

453
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,300
There is something more delicious over there!

454
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,680
The next time, I will buy strawberry for a man!

455
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,540
Nice to meet you!
