Of course I am!

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,320
Hmm...

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,480
There are too few days off for my work.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,060
I want to work five days a week like the rest of the world.

28
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,840
The rest of the world works two days a week.

29
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm working hard for the safety of the citizens.

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,400
It's a natural requirement.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,540
In Ryo-chan's case, he always works seven days a week.

32
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,060
But to complete this tight schedule,

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,120
I need the strength of an iron man.

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,100
Yes!

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,220
Yes!

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,300
This is Kameari.

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,400
Huh?

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,400
What is it?

39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,980
We're taking a break here.

40
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,700
Let's have lunch and then go to the toilet.

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,200
Senpai!

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,760
We're in trouble!

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Huh?

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,060
What's going on?

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,060
It's like that!

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
What's going on?

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,820
It's dangerous!

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
Please get off!

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,440
Yes, please get off!

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,820
It's dangerous!

51
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,820
It's no good!

52
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,520
Please don't get in!

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
What's going on?

54
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
Please don't get in!

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,620
Please get off!

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,120
It's dangerous, so please get off!

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,080
Please get off!

58
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,120
Please get off!

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
No, no, no, no, we'll be in trouble if we get in.

60
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,160
Get off!

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,700
Get off!

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,480
I'm getting into trouble!

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,500
Sorry!

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
Mr. Nakagawa!

65
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,240
Where's the injured man?

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,260
He's not here.

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,500
Where is that elephant?

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
In the勝負's storeroom.

69
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,680
Hurry up and get him out of here!

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
See? You're used to it.

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm not used to it!

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,400
You mean how is he?

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,940
I'd like to get on with him.

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,540
Do wait!

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,680
Mr. Nakagawa! Do wait!

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:23,760
Mr. Nakagawa! You're being too dangerous!

77
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,080
Mr. Nakagawa! You're being too dangerous!

78
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,580
What's that? It's discrimination!

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,840
It's discrimination. Now, hurry up and tell him!

80
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,940
Here you go.

81
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,280
No, thanks.

82
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,080
What? It's a kid.

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,960
See? The kid's fine.

84
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,660
The kid's fine.

85
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,680
It's quiet. Is he okay?

86
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,360
Senpai!

87
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,000
Watch out, Nakagawa!

88
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,500
Let me go!

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,680
Let me go, Senpai!

90
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,980
Nakagawa!

91
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,460
Nakagawa!

92
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,360
Bring me milk and milk bottles!

93
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,340
What?

94
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,140
Hurry up!

95
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,360
Y-Yes, sir!

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,840
Oh, Mr. Nakagawa!

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Mr. Nakagawa!

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,380
I'm glad you're okay.

99
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,900
Excuse me.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,340
Do you have milk and milk bottles?

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,580
Yes, sir.

102
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,940
There, there.

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Don't be afraid.

104
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,160
You're fine.

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,380
Just fill your nose with milk.

106
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,740
That'll make you feel better.

107
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,860
Okay, okay, okay.

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Nakagawa, you're still not good enough.

109
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm done!

110
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,420
Do you drink milk or something?

111
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,460
Milk is the basic of all mammals.

112
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,660
Here, here's your milk.

113
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm a cow's father.

114
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,420
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Here, here, here.

116
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,500
See?

117
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,060
Like this.

118
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,360
See?

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,660
See?

120
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,820
Drink it.

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,060
He drank it!

122
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,620
There, there.

123
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,800
Good boy.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,440
Good boy.

125
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,960
You're oftentimes surprised, aren't you?

126
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah.

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
Don't feel bad.

128
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,580
Don't worry.

129
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,220
Don't worry.

130
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,660
Don't be afraid.

131
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,140
I know it's a small animal.

132
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,080
It's a wild animal, though.

133
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,040
It's big but it's still a child.

134
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
If I don't get excited, it'll be a quiet animal.

135
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,920
But where did this elephant come from?

136
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,240
I don't think someone bought it as a pet.

137
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,900
I don't think it's been swimming around the beach from Africa.

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,300
Then it's probably a zoo.

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,020
I see.

140
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
Well, take care of it until you get it.

141
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,880
Let's go home, Nagagawa.

142
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,580
Please wait for me, Mr. Oomari!

143
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,160
Nagagawa!

144
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
No, you can't leave me, Senpai.

145
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,500
It's a wild animal, Zo!

146
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,920
It's the best couple.

147
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,820
Why is Zo here?

148
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,800
He said he was lost, so Ryo-chan picked him up.

149
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,720
Why is he in the escape room?

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,500
He should be in the front, so he won't get drunk.

151
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,100
He'll be here by morning.

152
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,540
It's better to leave him here than to leave him alone.

153
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,380
Ryo-chan's been kind to him, so he's completely used to it.

154
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,860
He's loved by everyone but humans.

155
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm going to eat you!

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,280
Here you go.

157
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,160
Wow, it's a real one! It's huge!

158
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,220
I'll give you 100 yen and you can put it on your head.

159
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,640
Really?

160
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,600
Ryo-chan!

161
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm just kidding.

162
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,920
It's free. It's fine.

163
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
Try putting it on your head.

164
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,460
Put it on, put it on!

165
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,300
I can't help it.

166
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,400
Here you go.

167
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,620
Here you go.

168
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,820
Wow, it's amazing!

169
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,100
It's so expensive!

170
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,500
It's a real one!

171
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,840
It's a real one!

172
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,940
Is there any request for a search?

173
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,240
I've reported it to the head office, but there's still nothing.

174
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,640
Well, if you're going to get caught, I'll give you some milk.

175
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,400
Are you going home, senpai?

176
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,180
What?

177
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,920
What?

178
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,820
Yotsun!

179
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,320
What? What?

180
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,620
What are you doing?

181
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,760
Why are you all looking at me like that?

182
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,320
Tell me!

183
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,260
My work is over!

184
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,040
The TV set is officially democracy until tomorrow!

185
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,200
I can't go home for a whole day anyway!

186
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,360
Go home!

187
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,160
Why don't you take care of this one?

188
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,280
No!

189
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,380
Huh?

190
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:05,980
What?

191
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,420
It's his schedule for tomorrow's TV broadcast vote.

192
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,420
The schedule's already numbered!

193
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,600
Almost 10 p.m.

194
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,660
A few minutes of breakfast,

195
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,260
9:30 a.m.

196
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,700
Pueblo

197
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,060
Oh, it's already 10:00.

198
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,840
10:45, morning service.

199
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,980
It's already late.

200
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,600
You guys go home.

201
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,420
12:00, lunch.

202
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,920
That's right.

203
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,260
He's a very plan-oriented person.

204
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,240
He's irresponsible.

205
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,520
If you brought him here, you should have taken care of him to the end.

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,300
That's right, Ryo-chan.

207
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,860
He's not my elephant.

208
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,280
He didn't bring him here.

209
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,420
He came here on his own.

210
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,100
He's going to be beaten up for this.

211
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,680
He's going to be beaten up for this.

212
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,600
Good work.

213
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
See you later.

214
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm going home.

215
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,900
I'm going home.

216
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm going home.

217
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,340
Let go of me.

218
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,280
Let go of me.

219
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,860
You're not leaving me.

220
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,800
I'll take you with me, Ryo-chan.

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't be silly.

222
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,660
Keep it that way, Ryo.

223
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,460
This is an order from the chief.

224
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,140
What?

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,540
Is that a question of that big?

226
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,960
Is that a question of that big?

227
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,320
That's an order from the chief.

228
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,020
If you have a complaint, go to the chief of the wall.

229
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,720
If you have a complaint, go to the chief of the wall.

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,080
Please let me go to the chief.

231
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,620
I won't allow this.

232
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:33,940
Ehhhh!

233
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,100
Ehhhh!

234
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,600
Ehhhh!

235
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,420
Ehhhh!

236
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,960
Ehhhh!

237
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,560
I just cleaned the floor.

238
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,880
I shouldn't have to walk on dirty feet.

239
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,420
It's fine. It's fine.

240
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm sorry.

241
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,320
What are you doing, Ryo?

242
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,760
Don't put that in the bath.

243
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,760
It's an order from the aunt.

244
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,820
If you have any problems, tell her.

245
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,020
Ehhhh!

246
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,080
Ehhhh!

247
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:08,780
Ehhhh!

248
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,760
Okay, the other direction.

249
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,640
Ehhhh!

250
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,400
Okay, now to the back.

251
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm pretty clean now.

252
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,260
You just wait here.

253
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,540
This guy will understand what I have to say.

254
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,840
Ehhhh!

255
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,040
Ehhhh!

256
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,020
Ehhhh!

257
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,420
I don't understand at all, Ryo.

258
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm begging you, stop begging.

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,620
What's wrong?

260
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,400
What's wrong?

261
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,340
Huh?

262
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,000
You little brat! This is my breakfast!

263
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,440
What are you going to do with our breakfast?

264
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,760
Ryo-san is going to be like this because he brought in an elephant.

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,280
You're the owner of the house, you should take responsibility!

266
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,060
I said this isn't my elephant!

267
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,020
Please do something, Ryo-san!

268
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,440
Listen, bring him in!

269
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm begging you!

270
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,700
Don't wait! Bring him in right away!

271
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,700
Because I haven't heard anything about the elephant.

272
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,100
Then where did he come from?

273
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,580
Is he a Nora elephant?

274
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,820
Then call the insurance company!

275
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,940
Anyway, we'll contact them once we get some information.

276
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,040
Please do that.

277
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,960
He's just like me.

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,920
He's always trying to get into my stuff.

279
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,220
Isn't it

280
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,240
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

281
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:12,940
What?

282
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,780
What's going on?

283
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,960
You're the one who to blame.

284
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,160
You're the leftovers!

285
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,620
What's wrong?

286
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,920
This is the one I wanted!

287
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,100
8,000 yen.

288
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,680
I forgot my wallet in Ryo's.

289
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,940
Again? Don't say that.

290
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,580
No, I mean it. I'll bring it back next time.

291
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,220
Ryo!

292
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,040
He's already here.

293
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
The back door is this way.

294
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh! Don't come in, Ryo.

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,420
Ryo, there are two more people.

296
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,780
I have an urgent meeting.

297
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,860
If you want, you can bring the money.

298
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
Don't be so rude.

299
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,380
I'll pay for it, so please don't sell it.

300
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,360
Please!

301
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,440
No!

302
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,600
I can't stand being caught.

303
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,080
I can't stand it!

304
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,440
This is a police fight!

305
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,560
Why do I have to date an elephant on my holiday?

306
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,660
Don't do it! You don't know anything!

307
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,260
Oh, you're thirsty after running.

308
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,700
Pointing at the tendencies of the door.

309
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,200
Ah, darn it!

310
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,440
10 yen left!

311
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,960
10 yen left...

312
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,760
Oh, here's the 1-0-0-0 grape.

313
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,580
1-0-0-0 grape...

314
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,200
1-0-0-0...

315
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,660
10 yen...

316
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,680
I can't believe it.

317
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,020
It's a little money.

318
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,040
If you're already drunk, you can't tell the owner of the bar by the time you get to the bar.

319
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,460
If you're already drunk, you can return the bottle.

320
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,160
Good, good.

321
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,060
You're a good boy.

322
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,500
Then, here's a little grape.

323
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,420
Oh, no! I spilled my drink!

324
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't drink this when my throat is dry!

325
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,640
Give me back my 100 yen!

326
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,080
Give it back, you bastard!

327
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,700
Two more?

328
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,920
I'll get you another one.

329
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
My throat is dry.

330
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,400
I can't go back to get my wallet.

331
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
And I can't pay for my 10 o'clock bill.

332
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,880
Thanks to you, I can eat breakfast.

333
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,320
And now I can plan my schedule for the day.

334
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,660
I'll give you 100 yen.

335
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,760
What the hell is this?

336
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,780
Did you pick it up again?

337
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,980
It's my wallet.

338
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,540
And it's heavy.

339
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,920
Hey, it's a big one!

340
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,640
Oh, I was looking for that wallet.

341
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,700
Thank you. You saved me.

342
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,740
What proof do you have that this is your wallet?

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,980
I think it's a picture I took with my grandchild.

344
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,620
I don't know.

345
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,840
I learned that I can prove anything I want.

346
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,080
Hmm, I'm not that impressed with carrying coins.

347
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,880
You're too kind.

348
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,200
But it seems like a rare pet.

349
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:52,100
I heard that in Asia, there are many countries that treasure elephants as their gods ever since ancient times...

350
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,700
Gods?

351
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm sorry but this is a small animal,

352
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
so it's worthy of your food.

353
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,160
Even if it's just a food bill.

354
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
What? This much?

355
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,420
I'd say it's about one percent.

356
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,320
Well, good luck.

357
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,460
I-I have 30,000 yen!

358
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,120
I think I've made it!

359
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,960
Then I'll have to go back to work on the afternoon schedule!

360
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,020
You better make it, god!

361
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,000
How much is the ticket for the elephant?

362
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,740
I-I don't have an elephant ticket.

363
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,720
Then I'll take it for free.

364
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,140
It's free!

365
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,060
What?

366
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,240
You're too fat to eat!

367
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,280
If you don't pass, we'll have to say goodbye here!

368
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
If you're upset, try jumping!

369
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,120
The elephant's still hungry.

370
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,500
She'll be coming again...

371
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,720
Wait, mister!

372
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,740
The business round trip is coming up soon.

373
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,280
Hurry up, the train is coming!

374
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,360
The person who gets off first.

375
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,700
Excuse me, can I have a second?

376
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,900
Damn it! What the hell!

377
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,240
He's not coming at all!

378
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,500
What's with that old man?

379
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,720
He's just saying what he wants!

380
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,880
This is the last 1000 yen.

381
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,040
If I get this off, I can go back home walking to Kameyari.

382
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,000
If I get 47, it's 20 times as much.

383
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,320
But there's also the 36 line.

384
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,700
The person in the back is waiting.

385
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,940
Please line up after you get it.

386
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,640
The 6th race will start soon.

387
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,780
We'll aim for the 2nd and hope for the next race.

388
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,040
It's the 2nd.

389
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,540
It's the 1st.

390
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,180
No, it's the 2nd!

391
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,100
The next one.

392
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,900
No, it's not!

393
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,480
3738.

394
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,280
100 yen.

395
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,880
The garbage truck and the mountain.

396
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,720
I've never heard of it.

397
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,800
What?

398
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,740
They're both signposts of salvation!

399
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,700
How dare you make me drive a car like this!

400
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,240
You pervert!

401
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,760
You bastard!

402
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,680
You bastard!

403
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,140
What?

404
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,480
What?

405
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,480
What?

406
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,300
What?

407
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,440
What?

408
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,060
What?

409
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,860
What?

410
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,240
What?

411
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,720
Huh?

412
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,820
What?

413
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,700
What?

414
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,640
What?

415
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,780
What?

416
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,940
What?

417
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:31,960
What?

418
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,280
He won.

419
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,720
What?

420
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,760
He won.

421
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,540
What?

422
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,560
What?

423
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:40,860
What?

424
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,640
He won.

425
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,520
You...

426
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,660
You will be the bell!

427
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,620
Here you go, Mr. Bell.

428
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,780
Here, it's a new car.

429
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm sorry, you were a wonderful elephant.

430
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,840
Okay, I'll treat you to anything thanks to this Manba sword.

431
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,900
Where did Ryo-chan go with the elephant?

432
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,420
Yes, this is the Kameari Park.

433
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
He saw the elephant!

434
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,780
I feel like I can be a good friend with you for a long time.

435
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,560
It's cold!

436
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,360
You're a good boy!

437
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,120
This guy, this guy, this guy!

438
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,600
You look cute when you look at me.

439
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,900
You're a good boy!

440
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,220
Tantan!

441
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
Tantan?

442
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,800
Ryo!

443
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,560
Captain!

444
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,000
What's the plan to take the elephant to the city?

445
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,840
I got a call from the dispatch office that a search request was coming from the zoo.

446
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,240
But Ryo-chan is missing.

447
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,740
Anyway, I'm glad the elephant and the senior are safe.

448
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,300
Thank you for your help.

449
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,920
I heard that Tonto's mother passed away yesterday.

450
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,020
What?

451
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,340
The zoo is full of mothers.

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,960
I completely forgot about Tonto.

453
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,920
He was lonely and left the cage.

454
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,220
Tonto helped me a lot.

455
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,860
What?

456
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,420
What are you talking about?

457
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm talking about you!

458
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,000
Hey!

459
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,920
What's wrong with my elephant?

460
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,680
No, no, no!

461
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,200
Ryo!

462
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,400
What are you doing?

463
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,600
What are you talking about?

464
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:24,900
Let go of me.

465
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,340
Don't worry, he's alright.

466
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,780
What are you doing?

467
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,500
Let go of me.

468
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,480
Captain, he doesn't like it.

469
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,420
I'll take care of him.

470
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,200
You idiot!

471
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,220
Nakagawa!

472
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,620
Come here.

473
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,660
Yes, sir.

474
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
Let go of me!

475
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,060
Senior!

476
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,500
Nakagawa, don't ever talk to me.

477
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,800
You are in danger.

478
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,720
What's going on?

479
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,600
But, sir...

480
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,620
Yes, sir.

481
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,360
I need you to help me out, Captain!

482
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,700
All right, I got it!

483
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,660
Stop it, let go!

484
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,440
You won't be able to win now!

485
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,940
Tonto's mine!

486
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,060
Y-You're so kind...

487
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,260
I'm sure I won't forget this when I get back to the zoo, Tonto.

488
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,620
Tonto! Wait for me, Tonto!

489
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,860
Wait! Tonto!

490
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,400
Senpai...

491
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,860
Ryo, you're so kind even when you look like that.

492
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Tonto!

493
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,100
Tonto! Tell me! What's the next Tendo Show?!

494
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,020
I just want him to win in the zoo with me.

495
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,920
Tonto!

496
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,900
If Tendo Show doesn't work, I'll lose!

497
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,040
No, I mean, what's the next Derby?!

498
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,480
Tonto!

499
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,440
Did you fall in love with Megumi-chan, the lunch box lover?

500
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Good job, Honda!

501
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,160
You'll get her for sure on the 102nd show.

502
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm a nice middle guy with a lot of experience.

503
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
I'll teach you the points of dating.

504
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,840
Next time on "Run, Honda! For Love!"

505
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,440
Don't miss it!

506
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:54,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

507
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:24,020
Translated by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

508
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,840
Outside the door, the sun is calling
