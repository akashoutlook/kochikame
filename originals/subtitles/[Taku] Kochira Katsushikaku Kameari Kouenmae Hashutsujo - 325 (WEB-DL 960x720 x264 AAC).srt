1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,800
I look up at the sunset floating in the middle of the sea

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,320
And fly to the corner of Koishi

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,480
I kicked the stone and flew to the corner

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,920
I wonder if I'm going to the taiko that I joked about

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,740
I laughed at the fact that it was still a joke

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,840
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only get angry

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,260
The cityscape that never changes even if I make a fuss is kind

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,280
Because the crows are crying, the sun is already setting

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,580
Yeah!

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,520
I wonder if I'm going to be left alone

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,020
From the water level of the Tungari Falls

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,680
To the Taishakuten

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,820
The sunset falls

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Tomorrow will end with a loud noise

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,500
I laughed at the fact that it was still a joke

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,980
I laughed at the fact that it was still a joke

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,740
I realized that I'm a silly person

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,540
Yeah!

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,620
I got a little nervous

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,660
The river

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,880
The flower

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,580
And the strawberry

24
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,380
Chiba Flower Farm

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,780
Welcome to Chiba Flower Farm Chiba Flower Farm

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,620
Director! Perfect!

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,060
Okay, for that talk

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,160
I will make the TV commercials

29
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,200
Haruhi-kun

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,620
What's the plan of today's group visit?

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
Yes, please wait a moment.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,820
Well, I want to thank the Enji in Tanpopo kindergarten,

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,220
and the Himawari Yoroin.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,900
And...

35
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,400
I heard that there were only two groups this morning.

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,480
That's because I suddenly got a reservation yesterday.

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,900
What's that place?

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,340
Well, it's the Katsushika office in Tokyo.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,880
What?

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,460
What's going on?

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,060
He's coming!

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,460
That guy is...

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
He's coming again!

44
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,200
He's coming to our house again!

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,240
This is the man's strawberry feast!

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,720
The man who ate the strawberries we made with all our heart and soul,

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,540
just like in Black Hole, is coming.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,720
That man?

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,280
Who?

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, you guys who joined recently don't know that man, do you?

51
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,420
Just remembering him is terrifying.

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,780
Welcome to the flower garden center.

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,940
Thank you!

54
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,720
We'll take care of you!

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,740
It's milk.

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,300
Please take one by one.

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,660
Yes.

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
This way, please!

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,420
This strawberry is so small and cute.

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,320
Really!

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,660
But it's not red yet, so let's take it for our next guest.

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,640
What?

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,500
Good!

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,360
Akichi!

65
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,860
Whether it's red or green, it has no taste!

66
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,560
It has no taste.

67
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,640
It's so cute!

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,320
What's with him?

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Well, please eat more and more.

70
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,200
Is it really okay to eat more and more?

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,100
Of course!

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,380
You can eat without taking it home.

73
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,600
Okay, I got it.

74
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,600
It's delicious.

75
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,340
That's it!

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,720
That's cheating!

77
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,640
Guest!

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,160
You're eating a lot.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,680
No!

80
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,500
What are you doing?

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
That man is a monster.

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,040
He's a monster!

83
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,360
What?

84
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,980
What do you mean he's a monster?

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,040
That's not him.

86
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,720
A monster is like this!

87
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,940
What?

88
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,480
What?

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,800
What?

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,160
What?

91
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,260
What?

92
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,940
That's what I'm talking about!

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,620
It was a nightmare.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
He is a monster.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,900
He ate the whole house.

96
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,220
He ate everything.

97
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,620
He didn't even put pen and paper in the house.

98
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,420
That's why he has this kind of paper.

99
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,260
It's just something you can't think of.

100
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,460
But he won't do it again this year.

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,820
Guests!

102
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,800
For the sake of the strawberries and fruits we've grown,

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,500
I will definitely revenge him!

104
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh!

105
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,420
He's here!

106
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,840
Welcome!

107
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,960
Now, everyone.

108
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,060
Please take the container and milk.

109
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,300
Welcome.

110
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,300
Please take only the red strawberries.

111
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,760
Yes.

112
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,060
Here you go.

113
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,680
He was sleeping so well.

114
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,380
He's sleeping too much.

115
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,520
Welcome.

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm looking forward to this year too.

117
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,540
I've been waiting for you.

118
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,360
Here he comes!

119
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,940
Excuse me.

120
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,680
This way.

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,700
What?

122
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,520
Everyone is here.

123
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,040
Here he is.

124
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,300
Yes.

125
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
This house is for women and those who can't eat.

126
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
Everyone seems to be hungry.

127
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,580
I'm just saying.

128
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,520
That's right.

129
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,600
We've been eating strawberries early.

130
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,540
We've been eating for 3 days for this day!

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,620
I thought so.

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,780
For those people like that,

133
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,940
we've prepared a house where they can eat some big strawberries.

134
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm glad you prepared it.

135
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,760
Where is that house?

136
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,040
Over there.

137
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,780
I'm stuck.

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,740
I can make a revenge.

139
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,040
Everyone who is hungry,

140
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,440
please take this Asian strawberry.

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,400
Yay!

142
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,540
Huh?

143
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,940
Hey!

144
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,300
Where are the strawberries?

145
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,960
They're just cucumbers painted red!

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,020
What are you talking about?

147
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,180
This is a brand new Asian strawberry.

148
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,840
But they look like red cucumbers.

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,020
I can't believe I can't eat them.

150
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,620
But they're three times better than regular strawberries.

151
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,200
So please try them if you think they're cheating on you.

152
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,080
See you.

153
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,020
Hey!

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,380
Wait!

155
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
We're not kappa!

156
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,920
Hey!

157
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,460
Senpai, let's just eat.

158
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,800
I can't help it.

159
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
This tastes just like cucumbers.

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,820
They don't go well with milk.

161
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,840
I think miso would be better.

162
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,360
Honda, get me some miso!

163
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
Yes, sir.

164
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Yum-yum.

165
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I knew you'd like miso.

166
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,760
It's like monocule.

167
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Leave some for me, too.

168
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,140
What?

169
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
You ate them all?

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,560
Where's the next strawberry house?

171
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,520
Oh, yes.

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
The next house.

173
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,380
You're not going to feed me another strange new species, are you?

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,520
No, no.

175
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,880
This time, it's a two-kilogram-long strawberry.

176
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,380
What?

177
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,180
Senpai, I think we can go there next time.

178
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,940
Okay, I'll eat all the strawberries.

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,120
Yes!

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
What do you think?

181
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,680
Well, no matter how you look at it, it's pumpkin.

182
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,180
But once you break it, it tastes like strawberry.

183
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,640
No way!

184
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,220
What's the boss thinking about, with those cucumbers?

185
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Wait.

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,200
No, no, no!

187
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,000
No!

188
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,700
Okay, that's it.

189
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:36,960
I got it.

190
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,540
He's trying to get revenge last year.

191
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,120
I have some ideas, too.

192
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,400
I can't believe you figured out what to do with a red pumpkin to make a strawberry.

193
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,760
No matter how tough that man is, I'll make up for it this time.

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,940
Senpai, what's your idea?

195
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,460
Listen, didn't the director say the house next door is a strawberry?

196
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,180
Yes.

197
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,640
That Asian house over there is a strawberry.

198
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,920
This is a house next door, right?

199
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,400
Yes.

200
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,460
Look at this.

201
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,480
Look, look!

202
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,300
What?

203
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,820
Oh!

204
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,520
Melon!

205
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,720
Look, it's 1 kilo per grain.

206
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,320
This is the real jambo strawberry.

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,220
Right, Honda?

208
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,080
Yes, that's right.

209
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,800
All right, let's eat!

210
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,340
It looks delicious.

211
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,780
It looks delicious.

212
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,980
It's delicious.

213
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,200
It's delicious.

214
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,760
Jambo strawberry tastes like melon.

215
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,120
Maybe the jambo strawberry has been improved to taste similar to melon.

216
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,900
I see.

217
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,280
I have a bad feeling.

218
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,720
Director, I'm sorry.

219
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,040
There is a voice from the melon house.

220
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,580
No way.

221
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,780
There is a high-class melon that was grown by hand.

222
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,800
It cost 10,000 yen each.

223
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,360
Of course.

224
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,220
Melon this year is the best.

225
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,800
If something happens...

226
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,500
Oh!

227
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,140
Oh!

228
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,880
I ate it.

229
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,420
No way!

230
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,920
Hey, what are you doing?

231
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,780
Director, it was a really delicious strawberry.

232
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,800
What?

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
What?

234
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,420
This is...

235
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,880
Melon made with all my heart.

236
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,260
Eat them!

237
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Melon!

238
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,180
Oh, no.

239
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,860
The strawberry was delicious.

240
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,880
You guys!

241
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,080
You've eaten up the melon.

242
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,960
That?

243
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
That wasn't a jambo strawberry.

244
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,520
What is a strawberry?

245
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a melon that can be eaten one by one.

246
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,260
Let's eat them all.

247
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,980
I said the house next door.

248
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,400
I said the size is about this.

249
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,040
The weight is about the same.

250
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,880
I made a mistake.

251
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,640
Damn it.

252
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,940
Oh, no.

253
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,880
You've eaten up this house.

254
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,760
You'll let me eat the next house, right?

255
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,420
Okay, I'll let you eat.

256
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
I was hoping to fight you one day.

257
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,180
Oh, that's interesting.

258
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,240
I wonder if I can defeat this apple?

259
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
This tropical house has...

260
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,780
Banana, papaya, mango, pineapple.

261
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,460
And the king of fruits, Dorian.

262
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,740
There are many other tropical fruits, and you can eat them all.

263
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,200
However, I wonder if you can go that far.

264
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:43,960
Oh?

265
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,140
That's an interesting idea.

266
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,220
Bulb, get me a rope.

267
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
All right!

268
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,060
All right, it's okay.

269
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,680
There's no responsibility for any accidents in the garden.

270
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,140
Is that okay?

271
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,220
All right.

272
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,460
Let's go!

273
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,020
No way!

274
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,220
What a person!

275
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,060
Hey, Honda!

276
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,600
I'll pull you up, so tie yourself up with the rope!

277
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,960
All right!

278
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,280
Dance!

279
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,140
Director, are you okay?

280
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,040
I'm fine.

281
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,580
I still have a plan.

282
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,280
Don't underestimate me!

283
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,820
It's too late to say that!

284
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,500
What's wrong?

285
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,400
That different triangle is agenic.

286
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,620
What the hell is it?

287
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,300
diam 어릴�:"HOW?"

288
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,840
What is that?

289
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,800
A-are you relateal?

290
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,460
Well.

291
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,860
Get me some fruit.

292
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,500
Tell me you're okay.

293
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,040
Get me some fruit.

294
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,540
This is enough.

295
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,960
Now, I'll have the fruit of this house.

296
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,340
Okay, almost there.

297
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,760
A crocodile!

298
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,700
Senpai, what's that?

299
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,060
Why is there a crocodile in the plastic house?

300
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,540
A crocodile?

301
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,500
What's wrong with you?

302
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,180
You can't give up here, can you?

303
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,180
Hey, father!

304
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,700
I'll swim and cross the river!

305
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:20,540
I'm in trouble!

306
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,380
Senpai, I'm scared!

307
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,960
I can't do this anymore!

308
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,980
I give up!

309
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,220
I give up!

310
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,400
Not yet!

311
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,080
You're here!

312
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you talking about?

313
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,920
Leave it to me!

314
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,260
Crocodile!

315
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,640
If you're upset, come here!

316
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,380
Now, Gonji!

317
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, Honda!

318
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,600
Get on that crocodile!

319
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,600
What are you talking about?

320
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,920
Moribo, do it!

321
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,620
Okay!

322
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,240
No way!

323
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,600
Okay, do it!

324
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:55,720
Stop!

325
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,700
Okay, that's it!

326
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,620
Run!

327
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,460
That's it!

328
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,980
Why am I...

329
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
Why am I...

330
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,160
Why am I...

331
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,180
Why am I...

332
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,360
Why am I...

333
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,440
You did it, Honda!

334
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,280
Get on it!

335
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,200
Yeah!

336
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,540
Okay!

337
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Okay!

338
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,580
Okay, hold on tight!

339
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,300
Okay!

340
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,880
Okay, hold on tight!

341
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,690
Okay!

342
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay?

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,380
OK!

344
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,800
Yaaay!

345
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,260
Okay!

346
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,740
Another "Yes!"

347
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,400
Aaaaaaaahhh!

348
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,000
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,900
Wha, wha, wha, what the...

350
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,040
What's this?

351
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,440
And now...

352
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
I'm in trouble!

353
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,120
Her

354
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,180
His

355
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,620
Him

356
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,320
Him

357
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Him

358
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,940
Him

359
00:14:59,940 --> 00:14:59,960
Him

360
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,100
Her

361
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
Her

362
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,920
Her

363
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,260
Her

364
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,840
She ate the almond such a long time ago.

365
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,800
after working an hour, the fruits are so delicious.

366
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,820
She's an absolute fan.

367
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,240
I hope she learned how to use it.

368
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,220
I didn't see Dorian.

369
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,760
Enjo!

370
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,400
Dorian is over there!

371
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,800
A waterfall?

372
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,080
Yes, the Dorian House is on top of that waterfall.

373
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,360
There is the King of Fruits, Dorian!

374
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
It's not a big waterfall.

375
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,320
It's not a big waterfall.

376
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm going to climb this waterfall and then I'm going to get off the rope.

377
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,840
You're going to climb a waterfall?

378
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,280
What?

379
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,000
I tied you to the rock.

380
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,720
Get off the rope and climb.

381
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,040
Don't fall!

382
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,300
He's a scary person.

383
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,620
Hey, you want Dorian, King of Fruits?

384
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,380
It stinks!

385
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,440
What the hell is that smell?

386
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,580
Dorian said that the smell was bad, but I didn't think it would be this bad.

387
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,640
I'll come all the way here and give up, so I'll definitely eat the King of Fruits.

388
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,240
Dorian is in the water.

389
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,100
What's that?

390
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,880
Dorian, Dorian!

391
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,340
Rocky's girlfriend, hey Dorian!

392
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,820
Where's the dog?

393
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,740
What's he doing?

394
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,920
Are they in sync?

395
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
It's good.

396
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,760
This doesn't smell.

397
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
As expected of a king.

398
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,580
But it's a little smelly.

399
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,800
It's a little smelly.

400
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,140
It's a little smelly.

401
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,180
Ah, Dorian, Dorian.

402
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,780
Rocky's girlfriend, hey Dorian.

403
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,520
It smells in the water.

404
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:15,220
By the way, you haven't eaten strawberries yet.

405
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,040
That's right.

406
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,860
Let me eat a strawberry.

407
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,900
Yes, let me eat it.

408
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,820
All right.

409
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,500
I'll give you a piece.

410
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,620
I'll give you a lot of real strawberries!

411
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,800
The best strawberry, a 500 yen strawberry.

412
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,640
I'll feed you to eat this!

413
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,020
Director!

414
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,460
What?

415
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,040
Well...

416
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,320
Director, let's stop. It's too dangerous!

417
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,760
Shut up! It's revenge!

418
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,300
What are you doing?!

419
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,480
Well, if you're going to eat it, then eat it!

420
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,400
If you don't hurry, it'll burn!

421
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,480
What kind of guy is he?!

422
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,400
Senpai!

423
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,520
Senpai!

424
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,280
No way!

425
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,540
Are you going?

426
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,660
I'll eat it!

427
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,980
No way!

428
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,060
Guys, what's wrong?

429
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,400
Senpai is in there!

430
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,100
What? Ryo-chan?

431
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,400
It's so hot! I don't have time to dip it in milk!

432
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,820
There's a burnt strawberry too...

433
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,460
Senpai!

434
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Ryo-chan!

435
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,200
Ryo!

436
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:45,880
You!

437
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,560
It was delicious!

438
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,100
Grilled strawberry! What are you going to feed me next?

439
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,300
Damn you!

440
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,060
I'll settle this one time!

441
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,720
Director! Let's stop!

442
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,400
He's not a living being on Earth!

443
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,360
Let go!

444
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,120
This time it's a game!

445
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm in that game!

446
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,120
The ultimate fruit made by collecting the water of biotechnology!

447
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,640
Eat as much as you want of rainbow watermelon!

448
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,580
What? Watermelon?

449
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't underestimate me!

450
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,700
Rainbow watermelon!

451
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,640
It's a rainbow watermelon!

452
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,360
What is it?

453
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,960
It's a watermelon made of strawberries, oranges, bananas, melons, kiwis, and grapes.

454
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
Amazing!

455
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,540
It looks delicious!

456
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,820
Seven flavors!

457
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,660
Okay, let's eat!

458
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,600
Alright!

459
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,400
Hehehe...

460
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
What?

461
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,700
What?

462
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,040
What is it?

463
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,240
What is it?

464
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,840
What is it?

465
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,000
What is it?

466
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,600
If you press this switch, you can open the handle and enjoy the rainbow watermelon hunting with the lion!

467
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
Oh, I see.

468
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,800
It's not bad to hunt fruits with the lion.

469
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,160
But it's a little risky to hunt only the rainbow watermelon.

470
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,560
But it's a little risky to hunt only the rainbow watermelon.

471
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,660
He even gave me cash!

472
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,940
What? Cash?

473
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,920
Yes! Cash!

474
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,500
A-a little money...

475
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,660
What? I don't want to spend money even though I'm only alive!

476
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,980
After all, money is more important than the lives of humans!

477
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,880
You should take care of your own money!

478
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,880
Director, don't provoke me!

479
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,220
Fine, I'll do it! Wait for me!

480
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,120
Director!

481
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,580
I'll give you the 500 million you secretly saved up for your wife!

482
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,820
You'll never get it back!

483
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,660
But instead, you have 30 minutes to save up!

484
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,440
Enjoy yourself!

485
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Reiko-san, is it okay if I don't give you the money?

486
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,680
Don't worry about it.

487
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,600
We can see the result once we give you the money.

488
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,400
Reiko-san!

489
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,560
It's quiet now.

490
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,620
It can't be, senpai!

491
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,000
Hey, give it back!

492
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,340
I'm sorry I had to trouble you.

493
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,420
Sen-senpai...

494
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,780
I got the 100 million you stole from the lion.

495
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,700
I got the rest!

496
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,500
Now, where's the other 100 million?

497
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,580
Huh?

498
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,340
I was able to get the strawberry I wanted...

499
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,260
Time's up!

500
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,280
I'll return what we haven't been able to get.

501
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,220
What?

502
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,040
Too bad.

503
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
Come back next year!

504
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,560
It can't be helped.

505
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,860
Ryou-chan, make sure to clean up properly.

506
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,060
Sorry.

507
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,220
I'll excuse myself first.

508
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
Hey, wait! You guys!

509
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,980
Are you leaving? Wait!

510
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,140
Don't leave me!

511
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,640
Don't leave me!

512
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,680
Like someone calling me

513
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,740
After the rain

514
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,540
I walked looking back

515
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,760
I reached out to my mom

516
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,680
I felt

517
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,660
A strange feeling

518
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,340
So

519
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,140
I walked on the dark side

520
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,060
Of the

521
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,600
Everyone was a child once

522
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,740
But everyone has forgotten

523
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,540
The politician with a great face

524
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,140
And the blue aunt above the eyes

525
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,820
I'll turn around and look

526
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,400
At that corner

527
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,120
And see everyone

528
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,860
And see everyone

529
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,960
There's a camera over there

530
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,660
There must be a camera

531
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,920
Everyone, come to our town

532
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,180
There's a camera over there

533
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,880
There must be a camera

534
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,040
Everyone, come to our town

535
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,980
Everyone, come to our town

536
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,100
Thank you!

537
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,260
The police

538
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,620
What's going on?

539
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,140
The police are running around the town

540
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,940
I'll catch you anyway

541
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,640
I'm going to the park

542
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,120
What?

543
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,840
Can I catch you alone?

544
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,260
That's impossible

545
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,380
Next time

546
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,160
Mr. Police, come on!

547
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,900
To be continued

548
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,900
Kameari over there

549
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,940
I'm sure you'll be able to catch it.

550
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm sure you'll be able to catch it.

551
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,820
Everyone, let's go to our town.

552
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,560
Everyone, let's go to our town.

553
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,120
Everyone, let's go to our town.

554
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,900
Thank you!
