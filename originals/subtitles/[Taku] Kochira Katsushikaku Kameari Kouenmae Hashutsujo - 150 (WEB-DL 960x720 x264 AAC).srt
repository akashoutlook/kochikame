1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,260
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,440
Make the room bright and try to get away

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,720
"The End of the Rain"

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,000
"The End of the Rain"

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,360
It's like someone is calling you

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,040
"The End of the Rain"

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,240
Looking back, I walked

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,840
"Mom, please help me"

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,220
At that time I felt

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,540
A strange feeling

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,680
So, I took the cable car

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,240
And walked only in black

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,900
"The End of the Rain"

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,380
Everyone was a child once

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,880
But they all forget

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,460
Politicians with a proud face

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,860
And a blue aunt above their eyes

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,760
Turn around and see

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
That corner

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,840
You can meet everyone

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,240
"The End of the Rain"

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,140
There is a turtle

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,420
Here is a turtle

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone, come to our town

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,080
"The End of the Rain"

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm back

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,740
I'm back!

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,720
Welcome back!

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,020
Oh, hey!

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,020
I got this for the lottery!

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,140
Huh?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Pierre Nishikaguchi?

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,360
Sounds like a mansion.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,680
What a snob!

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,820
You don't know him, senpai?

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,700
He's a hot topic right now.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,220
Who is he?

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,240
In the old days, he would go through the Berlin Wall,

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,180
the top of the Vanli,

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,180
and walk over the wings of a flying jet plane.

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,200
He would live inside a box that was buried for a month.

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,620
He's a magician who sells magic.

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,960
Isn't he amazing?

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,580
He's like Superman.

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,880
He's a magician, so he has tricks.

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,940
But he's quite worth seeing.

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,780
Let's go see him next time.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,600
He looks interesting, Ryo-chan.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,800
I'll watch him for the sake of the story.

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,780
The next morning

52
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:11,740
Ladies and gentlemen!

53
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,900
The father and mother!

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,120
The Ultra Super Miracle Magician,

55
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,480
Pierre Nishikaguchi!

56
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,960
Welcome!

57
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,360
Welcome!

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,180
I am the true magician,

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,260
Pierre Nishikaguchi!

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,980
Amazing!

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,480
What's going on?

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,760
He's coming out of that tiny box!

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,000
Isn't that surprising?

64
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,740
Huh?

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,580
I think on this stage,

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,740
there should be a hole for the stage.

67
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,440
A hole?

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,260
So, open that box,

69
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,080
and go through that hole.

70
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,500
Welcome!

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,420
I see.

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,820
He's using tricks to fool the children.

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,760
The magician of the century is going crazy.

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,340
I can't wait to see what happens next.

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680
The first part is hypnotism.

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,320
Anyone here want to help with the hypnotism?

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,260
Hey!

78
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,460
Hey! Hey!

79
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll help!

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,060
Yes!

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,060
Then, that person!

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,820
Hey!

83
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,040
Hey! I was faster, you bastard!

84
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:16,820
Hey!

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,780
Senior?

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,300
Yes.

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,540
You're getting sleepy.

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,660
You're getting sleepy.

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Then, count three.

90
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,380
You're a rabbit.

91
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,240
One, two, three!

92
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,660
You're Fujii Takashi.

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,520
No.

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:37,640
No.

95
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,740
No.

96
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,620
No!

97
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,180
No!

98
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,340
No.

99
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,420
You're completely stuck!

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,600
He's a cherry!

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,400
What?

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,740
He's got a big voice!

103
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,880
You can tell if he's a rabbit or not

104
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,360
based on the cherry placed on his back seat.

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,680
It's all up to you. It's a classic technique.

106
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,080
Then, this person, please come on stage.

107
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,080
Interesting, isn't it? Let's have him play.

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,680
You're getting sleepy.

109
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
You're getting sleepy.

110
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,740
It's nothing at all.

111
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,220
Ryo-chan is very challenging.

112
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,440
I hope it's not a fight.

113
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,020
See, you're getting sleepy.

114
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,620
Muu-kun.

115
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,660
You're getting more sleepy.

116
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,560
You're getting...

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,280
I'll give you money.

118
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,880
He's getting sleep-deprived.

119
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,840
He's really something.

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
You're Suzu-me-chan.

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Let's fly around the sky.

122
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,880
How much is it?

123
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,920
1,000 yen.

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
I suddenly woke up.

125
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,460
What's that?

126
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,100
Why did you wake up?

127
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,780
I knew it.

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,400
Just a moment.

129
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,360
He's getting sleepy.

130
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,020
I'll try again.

131
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
You're getting sleepy.

132
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,600
You're getting sleepy.

133
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
You're getting...

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
3,000 yen.

135
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,880
10,000 yen.

136
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,740
You're getting sleepy.

137
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,820
5,000 yen.

138
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,540
10,000 yen.

139
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,680
You're getting...

140
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,700
6,500 yen.

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,620
10,000 yen.

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,480
You're getting sleepy.

143
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
You're getting...

144
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
I got it.

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,140
You're a dog.

146
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,800
You're getting a dog.

147
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,240
You're getting sleepy.

148
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,180
You're getting sleepy.

149
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,260
Next is the 55th grader.

150
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,880
I'm going to fly.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,820
I can't believe Ryo-chan will become so bad.

152
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,460
He won't.

153
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
I didn't believe it at all.

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,500
He's really into it.

155
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,320
He's a real man.

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
The second part will start.

157
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,420
It was pretty amazing, wasn't it?

158
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,180
I have some business, so you guys go home first.

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,440
What are you talking about?

160
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,340
What are you talking about?

161
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,980
I'm here to take the 10,000 yen I promised you!

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,700
You're a really simple man.

163
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,840
That conversation was the spell of hypnotism.

164
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,740
You've been perfectly hypnotized.

165
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
You're a jerk!

166
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,380
30,000 yen, 50,000 yen, 10,000 yen.

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,080
You have such a spell?

168
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,200
You're not even in a hurry to give me money!

169
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,480
You bastard!

170
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
I get it! I get it!

171
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,120
You're so stupid.

172
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,240
You're so stupid.

173
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,520
You're so stupid.

174
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,360
What's this?

175
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,660
It's just a hair clip!

176
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,340
I gave you the real one.

177
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,100
Don't use magic, you bastard!

178
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,580
I told you not to use magic!

179
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,780
Stop using magic!

180
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,060
Stop using magic!

181
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,940
Stop using magic!

182
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,660
You medicationista!

183
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,380
If you do that, I'll tell everybody that you have hypnosis.

184
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,980
If you do that, I'll tell everybody that you have hypnosis.

185
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,040
What?

186
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,160
What's that?

187
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,620
What's that!

188
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,780
If you'll not close your eyes, I'll get rid of your hair clip.

189
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,360
This key is because you kindly gave it to me.

190
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,960
I just wanted to let you know.

191
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,520
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,640
I don't give a fuck.

193
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,620
Oh, nice to meet you, grandma.

194
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,900
What are you doing?

195
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,380
What?

196
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,520
Don't move!

197
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,900
It hurts!

198
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,560
You bastard!

199
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,660
Do you have a key?

200
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,520
What a stupid power.

201
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,140
Let's call it "Kairiki".

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,860
Hey, I've always wanted a partner.

203
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,020
Would you join my team?

204
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,660
Don't mess with me!

205
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm serious.

206
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,540
Of course I'll pay you monthly.

207
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,540
What are you talking about?

208
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,840
You're using people's money and you're saying it's the last day of the year?

209
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,800
It's the end of the year.

210
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,560
You're going to have to pay me back anyway.

211
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,900
No, no.

212
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm telling you it's real this time.

213
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,220
Right?

214
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,240
How is it?

215
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
Hey, Ryo-chan, this is for you.

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
Look at this guy.

217
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,740
He's definitely a senior.

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Right?

219
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,340
He was told to rest in the cold, but he was still sick.

220
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,640
Now, it's time for the climax of the magic show.

221
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,980
Pierre Nishikawaguchi and the man from Brazil, Mogambo,

222
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,020
will pass through the wall that used to be used in prisons.

223
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,480
We'll send you the miracle of the great magic on live.

224
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,960
Let's interview them.

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,220
Let's do it.

226
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,860
Pierre-san, we're going to start the show, but can you say something?

227
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,460
Hmm...

228
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,880
You seem to be very focused.

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,020
Well then, Mogambo-san, can you say something?

230
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,220
Mogambo!

231
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,920
Well then, let's watch the moment of the miracle.

232
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
Will it succeed?

233
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,700
Hmm...

234
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,500
Watch out, watch out.

235
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,380
Hmm...

236
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,220
Ah!

237
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,740
And after this...

238
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,000
What's that?

239
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,860
Here, I'll help you.

240
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,760
He's fast.

241
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,860
I used to be in the Ranger Corps.

242
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,220
What a great past.

243
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,340
Well then, let's open the curtains.

244
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,040
Don't you think it's better to dig a hole in the front?

245
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,140
Isn't it a fraud?

246
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
It's a magic.

247
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,480
By the way, you seem to be walking on the wings of a flying plane.

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,940
What kind of trick is it?

249
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,160
That's my miracle power.

250
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,140
Don't look at me now.

251
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,080
That's wearing powerful shoes with a heel.

252
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,940
Is that all?

253
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,220
I was always alive.

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Then, keep it in the box for a month on the ground.

255
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,500
That's...

256
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,180
Don't say that. I'll guess.

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,840
Get out of the tunnel I dug in advance and go somewhere.

258
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,760
When the box is dug up, I'll go back to the box.

259
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,580
That's right.

260
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,100
While I was hiding, I was hiding in the forest so that no one could see me.

261
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
I was lonely and lonely.

262
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,720
It's pretty plain and boring when you imagine it.

263
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,640
To create a miracle that seems unreasonable from the first sight.

264
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,500
Day and night, endless research and effort.

265
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Magician is a person who works hard and logically.

266
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,240
It's over if the magician talks about hard work.

267
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,740
More than that, time is fine.

268
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:06,880
Is it okay?

269
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,960
Oh no!

270
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,520
It's finally the moment of the miracle.

271
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,200
3, 2, 1, open!

272
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,320
Yes!

273
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
It's really wonderful!

274
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
Excuse me.

275
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,500
The viewer said that he wanted to see a place where you can pass without using a curtain.

276
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,560
That's right.

277
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,780
Please show that scene in front of you.

278
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,200
What?

279
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,280
I want to do it without a curtain.

280
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm digging a hole in the ground.

281
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,780
Nice!

282
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,520
Greg will see that.

283
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,840
It's closed.

284
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,280
Well, I've already broken.

285
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,920
Ah, I understood!

286
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Of course, it's possible to do without a curtain, but the planning time is already past, so

287
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,180
If you don't mind some time ekamacho, the producer now said OK.

288
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,020
If you don't mind, save it.

289
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,640
How much does it cost?

290
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, about the room?

291
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,080
Because of this wall.

292
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,140
- A wall... - Alright, ¥3000.

293
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,300
- ¥20,000. - ¥50,000.

294
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
- ¥20,000. - Too high.

295
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,220
- What is it? - Eh?

296
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,320
Oh, no. The girl's son-in-law is going to do the wall-pulling for me.

297
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,680
Eh? Really?

298
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,220
This is amazing!

299
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,040
- He's going to do the human wall-pulling without a curtain! - ¥80,000. ¥20,000.

300
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,440
- ¥100,000. - ¥20,000.

301
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,540
The magic of the past, present, and future!

302
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
The human wall-pulling!

303
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,760
I'd like to send you the curtain-less version again!

304
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,560
The wall-pulling!

305
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm going to change into the teacher, Pierre Nishikaguchi,

306
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,380
and do the wall-pulling magic!

307
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
The wall-pulling!

308
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,080
The wall-pulling!

309
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,320
The wall-pulling!

310
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,680
Will Ryotsu be able to do the wall-pulling?

311
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,960
The result is in 90 seconds!

312
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:09,960
"The power of the human wall-pulling!"

313
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,180
Elohim! Essaim! Elohim! Essaym!

314
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,080
Tonhirakoppe! Tobidabojo! Tamore! Tamore!

315
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,540
Kabenukete! Tamoure!

316
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,900
The reality is...

317
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,840
Kabenukenukedabuchya! Erashou! Kabenukenmurela!

318
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,620
Kabenukenmurela! Erashou! Kabenukenmurela!

319
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,080
We are going to freeze and then do the wall-pulling.

320
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,160
Ouch!

321
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,340
Just like this, I got out of the hole!

322
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,880
As you can see, I got out of the wall.

323
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,240
If you get used to it, you can get out of the sand even more.

324
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,500
Amazing! It's amazing! It's like a miracle!

325
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,760
I got out! I got out of the wall!

326
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,160
Alright! I can do it!

327
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,940
You're so strong!

328
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,160
I feel like I really got out of the wall.

329
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,920
But, is this magic?

330
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:29,640
You're so small!

331
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,680
You're more like a disciple than a teacher.

332
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,540
You're so big!

333
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,120
It's natural that I'm bigger than you.

334
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,880
But...

335
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,920
I'll tell you just in case.

336
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,500
I didn't intend to become your disciple.

337
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,720
I just wanted to tell you as a good disciple.

338
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,080
David Copperfield has erased the Goddess of Freedom again.

339
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,060
What?

340
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,100
The electric field's kappa is floating?

341
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,860
You're a magician, but you don't even know David Copperfield?

342
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,440
You can fly in the sky, and you can erase the train.

343
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,220
You're the world's best, the best, the best magician of the million-year-old!

344
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,600
What?

345
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,060
Yes!

346
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,540
It's flying even more than usual!

347
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,120
Yes!

348
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,580
Damn it!

349
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
You're so cheeky, and yet so cheeky!

350
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,080
The other day, you two successfully got out of the wall.

351
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,120
What kind of magic are you going to try next?

352
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,220
Well, that is...

353
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,700
If our rival, the electric kappa, has erased the Goddess of Freedom,

354
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
I will...

355
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,700
I will make a peace sign on Nara's temple!

356
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,560
Well then,

357
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,040
Miracle Magic: Pierre Power!

358
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
Miracle! Kuru Kuru Kuru!

359
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,200
Peace! Peace!

360
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,880
Peace, kuru kuru, kuru kuru, kuru, kuru kuru...

361
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,860
Easy peasy!

362
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,640
You're fooling around off your own.

363
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,220
Dear Riel,

364
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,500
What magic are you going to try next?

365
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,560
If our rival, the electric kappa,

366
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,540
can fly in the Grand Canyon,

367
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,920
I will become the wind of Saku Tottori!

368
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
Whaaaaaaaaat?

369
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
This is not magic!

370
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,660
This is the miracle magic of Pierre Nishikawaguchi, who is as strong as a steel shovel!

371
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,600
If you want to do it, do it yourself!

372
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,660
Yes! Turn around, turn around!

373
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,200
I'm gonna get you!

374
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,460
Mogi!

375
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,720
Alright! Now we're gonna have to escape!

376
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,580
Escape from the Ikezu!

377
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,060
Escape from the train!

378
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,620
Escape from the hell of the Shakuen!

379
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,800
Is there such an escape?

380
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,660
I don't care how much you pay me,

381
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm gonna pay you back with my life!

382
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,800
I'm quitting!

383
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,660
No way!

384
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,400
You just got popular!

385
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,940
You'll be on the CX for two hours this time,

386
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,820
so we'll work together to escape from here!

387
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm the only one who's strong!

388
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm gonna go back to the police station!

389
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,860
I'm gonna go back to the police station!

390
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,180
I'm gonna go back to the police station!

391
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm gonna go back to the police station!

392
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,820
I'm gonna pay you back with cash!

393
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
Don't say that!

394
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,220
I don't want to.

395
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,800
Why not?

396
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,960
Alright! Then I'll ask you one last time!

397
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,080
I'll ask you one last time!

398
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I'll ask you one last time!

399
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,000
Alright?

400
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,120
I'll pay you back ten times as much as you've done!

401
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,580
That'll be 100 times!

402
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,160
Alright!

403
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
It's starting, Reiko!

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,740
It looks like Ryo-chan is starting to lose weight too.

405
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:09,940
Right.

406
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,000
It looks like Ryo-chan is starting to lose weight too.

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,940
Hello, everyone!

408
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,660
Japan's number one magician,

409
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,240
Pierre Nishikawaguchi and his disciple Mogambo

410
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,800
are here to send you a miracle escape!

411
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
are here to send you a miracle escape!

412
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,320
Unfortunately, Mogambo has to retire

413
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,060
and will return to Brazil!

414
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,700
and will return to Brazil!

415
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,620
Pierre, this time,

416
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
it seems like a big escape!

417
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,020
Well,

418
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
at the start,

419
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,520
the box with Mogambo's hands and feet

420
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,580
will explode!

421
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,460
At the start?

422
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,300
Yes.

423
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,480
And Mogambo, who escaped the crisis,

424
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,540
will escape through this tunnel.

425
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,520
However,

426
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,860
there are many traps waiting for him

427
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:54,880
in this tunnel.

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,800
And Mogambo, who has successfully reached the goal,

429
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,200
will be able to get a prize of one million yen!

430
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,060
will be able to get a prize of one million yen!

431
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,760
I see!

432
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,700
But!

433
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,920
It's not just this!

434
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,620
If you don't press this button at the end of the escape,

435
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,860
the explosion will happen at the end of the escape!

436
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,700
the explosion will happen at the end of the escape!

437
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,360
A big explosion?

438
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,160
This seems to be a big deal!

439
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,420
I see!

440
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,740
Wait for me, 1 million yen!

441
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,820
I see!

442
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,120
I see!

443
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,520
I see!

444
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,660
I see!

445
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,000
I see!

446
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,720
I see!

447
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,720
I see!

448
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,240
I see!

449
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,440
I see!

450
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,280
I see!

451
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,360
I see!

452
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,740
I see!

453
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,240
I see!

454
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,420
I see!

455
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,820
I see!

456
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,120
I see!

457
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,000
From just a moment,

458
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
the start point has been completelyonen Apollo!

459
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,580
Will he be safe!?

460
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,220
1 million yen!

461
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,240
1 million yen!

462
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,180
1 million yen!

463
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,940
1 million yen!

464
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,280
1 million yen!

465
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,360
"Waterfall"

466
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,000
-Oh! I just saw Mogambo-san!

467
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,120
Apparently, he's fine.

468
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
-What is it?!

469
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,480
-Sli... Sli...

470
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,420
-Aaaah!

471
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,000
-Nya! Nya! Nya! Nya! Nya!

472
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,960
-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

473
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,260
-As expected of Mogambo-san! You're good!

474
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,780
-We're still in the beginning.

475
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,980
-Nya? Nya?

476
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,400
-Aaaah!

477
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,200
-Nya! Nya! Nya! Nya! Nya!

478
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,960
-Aaaah!

479
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,080
-Aaaah!

480
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,440
-Aaaaaah!

481
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,220
-Aaaaaah!

482
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,600
-Eh?

483
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,060
-Aaaah!

484
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,660
-Mogambo-san is doing well!

485
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,140
-No, but we're only one minute behind the time limit.

486
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,780
-Aaaah!

487
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,620
-Aaaah!

488
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,660
-Aaaaaah!

489
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,040
-Aaaah!

490
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,920
-Aaaah!

491
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,060
-I can't see! I can't see! I can't see!

492
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
-Shh! The baby is sleeping!

493
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,300
-One million yen! One million yen!

494
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,720
-Move!

495
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,540
-Aaaah!

496
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,160
-Aaaah!

497
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,180
-Aaaah!

498
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,140
-Aaaah!

499
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,720
-Aaaaah!

500
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:27,920
-Aaaah!

501
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,900
-Ugh! Uuuugh!

502
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,580
-What the hell is this?!

503
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,880
-Uuuugh!

504
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
-Aaaah!

505
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,960
-Here we go!

506
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,140
-Aaaah!

507
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,020
-Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

508
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,640
-Ouch! Ouch!

509
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,920
-I was hoping this would happen, so I was trying to avoid the low-intensity

510
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,740
-Nice!

511
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,940
-Aaaaaah!

512
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,120
-Aaaaaah!

513
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,800
-Aaaaaah!

514
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,540
-Aaaaaah!

515
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:56,920
-Aaaaaah!

516
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,280
-Aaaaaah!

517
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,860
-Aaaaaah!

518
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,840
-Aaaaaah!

519
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,280
-Aaaaaah!

520
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,680
-Aaaaaah!

521
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,660
-Aaaaaah!

522
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,880
-Aaaaaah!

523
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,480
-Aaaaaaah!

524
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,600
-Aaaaaah!

525
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,680
-Aaaaaaaah!

526
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,180
-Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

527
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,040
-Aaaaaaaah!

528
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:09,600
-Aaaaaaaah!

529
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:09,700
-Aaaaaaah!

530
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,500
-Aaaaaaaah!

531
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:10,900
-Aaaaaaaaah!

532
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,480
-Aaaaaaaaaaah!

533
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,840
-Aaaaaaaaah!

534
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,420
-Aaaaaaaaah!

535
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,340
-Aaaaaaaah!

536
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,000
-Aaaaaaaaaaah!

537
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,060
-Aaaaaaaah!

538
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:29,680
-Aaaaaaaah!

539
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,540
This is it!

540
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,560
If you don't have it, make it!

541
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,620
Help me!

542
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm going to make you pay for what you did to me!

543
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,960
The first time in history!

544
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,200
The miracle escape from Tomahawk!

545
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,120
It's about to start!

546
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:46,920
Help me!

547
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,680
Help me!

548
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,380
No!

549
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,920
No!

550
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,660
I can't escape!

551
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,860
What's wrong?

552
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,940
Komachi suddenly became a star!

553
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,300
Looking right or left, Komachi Komachi is booming!

554
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,240
Wait!

555
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,480
This guy might make a lot of money!

556
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,360
