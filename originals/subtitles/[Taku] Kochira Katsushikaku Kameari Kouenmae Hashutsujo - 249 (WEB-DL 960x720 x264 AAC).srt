To You"

00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,440
"When

look

don't

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,800
don't

00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,000

to

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

33
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,980
Look, the red spider is burning.

34
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,520
I wonder what will happen to it.

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,320
Do you understand?

36
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,340
I understand, I understand.

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,980
If you understand, then come to me silently.

38
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,920
The End

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm Terai Yoichi.

40
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm the first daughter of the Kamenari Park.

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm 162 cm and 65 kg.

42
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,920
My blood type is A.

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,660
My name is Okuri Banto.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,420
I have to do everything.

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,100
I have to work hard, but I have to take care of my wife and son.

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,580
I have to take care of my wife and son.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
I have to take care of my wife and son.

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,360
And she has to, because that child is her jedi brother.

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,160
I was always like that, but I'm worried about something recently.

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,540
Run! Terai Stump Rally for your Father

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,580
Is it a dream of the future?

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,600
Yes.

53
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,840
My father wrote a composition on the theme of a future dream.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,120
What kind of dream are you?

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,140
A pro baseball player?

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,540
A doctor?

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
It's called "steadfast living."

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,760
What?

59
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,400
One day, when I was reading a children's work,

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,680
I got a fixed monthly salary,

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,120
saved money, and built a small house...

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,100
It said that I wanted to live a stable and stable life until I'm old.

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,560
Isn't it great?

64
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,160
It's realistic and realistic...

65
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,280
But it's a dream of the future of nine sons.

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,960
It's a little lonely.

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,880
I think that the stable life is the best for Shou.

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,740
But when he was a child, it was more...

69
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,800
I understand.

70
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,140
I think it's okay to have a child's dream as a starting point.

71
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,580
For example, a spaceship...

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,520
A child is a child.

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,980
A child is a child.

74
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,020
A child who is close to a stable life can't have a big dream.

75
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,100
Ryo...

76
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,880
In the temple of life-saving and band-based,

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,020
the children of life-saving and band-based are raised.

78
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,180
This is the natural theory of the world.

79
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course, if I have a home of life-saving and band-based,

80
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,980
the children of life-saving and band-based will be raised.

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,580
Yes, there's a home of life-saving and band-based life!

82
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,780
It's the home now.

83
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,700
This is the home.

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,760
Yes, this is the home.

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,260
The children expect a big-ass home from their father.

86
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,780
Don't you say so?

87
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,900
I am dissatisfied with my home life.

88
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,140
He's not the only one.

89
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,500
There is Hachiro.

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,640
Is Hachiro from the Major League?

91
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,260
Yes.

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,820
Yes.

93
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,740
If Okuri Bantou can run through the base as fast as Hachiro, he's a great Naira-anda.

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,500
He won't lose to a homerun batter.

95
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,360
Our kids are worried about Hachiro.

96
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,260
I see. If a homerun is impossible, a Naira-anda might be...

97
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,120
...a hit for me too!

98
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:47,060
If I work hard on my Naira-anda, my kids might have dreams too!

99
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,840
Thank you, Nakagawa!

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,580
The joy of baseball is a homerun.

101
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,340
You just need to hit it once and you win!

102
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,140
Hey, you know what?

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,080
Next Sunday, there's a stamp rally for Hachiro.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,520
What?

105
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,100
I can't believe it.

106
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:12,600
The stamp rally for the big leaguer Hachiro Yukari, who was born in Kameari, is a 3-in-1 bat for Hachiro.

107
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
This is a coincidence!

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to the stamp rally!

109
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,440
I'll do my best for my kids!

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,040
That's the spirit, Terai!

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Take Hachiro's bat with your life Naira-anda spirit!

112
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,940
Okay!

113
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,700
I'll take Hachiro's bat!

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,880
What?

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,880
T-that's...

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,800
You're only interested in homerun batting, aren't you?

117
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,680
If Hachiro's bat is signed,

118
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,500
he must have at least 50,000 fans, no matter how much money he spends.

119
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,680
This is a great chance to make a fortune!

120
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,500
The big leaguer Hachiro, who was born in Kameari,

121
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,140
will hold a stamp rally for Hachiro.

122
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,540
Please collect stamps from the stamps book you have,

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,520
and score a goal!

124
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,600
There are a lot of people!

125
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Yeah...

126
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Wow!

127
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
Senpai!

128
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
If you don't get out of this group as soon as possible,

129
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,220
you'll be in trouble!

130
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,260
It's a list of losers!

131
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,600
So, the start dash is the final match!

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Yeah...

133
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,380
Well, I'll take the bat anyway.

134
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,380
I won't give it to just Ryo!

135
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,320
Okay, nice fight!

136
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,700
If you don't have that much spirit,

137
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,120
you won't get Hachiro's bat!

138
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,460
Well then, first...

139
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
Senpai!

140
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,380
Damn, there are still so many at the starting line!

141
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,580
As usual, he has a lot of power!

142
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,520
The big leaguer Kei!

143
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,020
Dad!

144
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,280
Ah!

145
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
The big leaguer's kids!

146
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,960
That's right!

147
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,000
Kenji!

148
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,740
Koji!

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,660
Dad, do your best!

150
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Makoto, look over there!

151
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,720
Dad!

152
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,160
Makoto!

153
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,260
You're doing great!

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,980
Okay, okay, move over here!

155
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,620
What the hell are you doing?!

156
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm sorry!

157
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm sorry!

158
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,380
Darn it!

159
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,320
Ouch...

160
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,920
Hey, Ryo!

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,580
The Terai are already gone!

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,980
Shut up!

163
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,700
Shut up!

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,260
Shut up!

165
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,760
Damn you!

166
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,920
I won't forgive you!

167
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,380
Dorya!

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,940
Ryo, you're amazing!

169
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,780
Are you okay?

170
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,200
Yes, yes, here's the stamp rally.

171
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,920
Yes, you go first.

172
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,220
Damn it, I'm so busy!

173
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,400
Here's the stamp!

174
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
The rally is not over yet.

175
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Are you going to take the money?

176
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,900
I can't help it.

177
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
I hope you win.

178
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,640
Here's the rally.

179
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,460
Hurry up and put the stamp on it!

180
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,080
Then let's talk about the history of this shrine and Hachiro.

181
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
I don't want to hear it.

182
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:23,900
Okay!

183
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,180
You're so young.

184
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Well, let's talk about the history of this shrine and Hachiro.

185
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:34,880
Okay.

186
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,240
In the first place, Hachiro and this shrine met each other when he was in the second grade of elementary school.

187
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,260
He ran up the stairs of the shrine and prayed for a dream for the future of the Grand League on this main road.

188
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,440
After that, Hachiro changed thealing, but never winded up even when he was in the first grade of elementary school.

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,140
In this way, after putting up a nation-wide shrine, Hachiro talked about the story of this place to him.

190
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,180
And in the original story, he said that Hachiro was the only one who heard about the actor, and well, Hachiro was the last one to hear about it.

191
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,260
So if I tell him this story, Hachiro will get willing to do it.

192
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,000
Isn't that the story of the shrine, so to speak?

193
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,680
Huh?

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,980
So what is that story?

195
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,820
The story of the shrine receber?

196
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,180
I know!

197
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,320
-Go! -Go!

198
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,860
-Terai! -Go!

199
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,040
Yes!

200
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,140
-What are you doing? -Hurry up!

201
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,600
Let's go!

202
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,900
Sa-saishen o...

203
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
This shrine and Hachiro-senshu...

204
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,680
Here!

205
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,700
How's that?

206
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,720
Damn it! You missed again!

207
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,520
Hey, please, give me a stamp!

208
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,020
-You'll get it. -Damn it!

209
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Here's the next one.

210
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,280
-One more time? -Yes.

211
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,780
Damn it. You missed again.

212
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,920
Here's the last one.

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,260
Don't make it in order.

214
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,460
What? What's wrong with you?

215
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,320
You did well at the start.

216
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,460
You hit me first!

217
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,360
Congratulations. You two passed.

218
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,720
What?

219
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,480
Yay!

220
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,780
Yes.

221
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,820
Let's go!

222
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,740
Damn it! I can't believe I lost to such a kid.

223
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,360
They're lucky.

224
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,260
I missed.

225
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,900
I missed again.

226
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,200
Yes. Good job.

227
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,320
All right. I finally got it.

228
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,560
Taikin...

229
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,460
I got it. I'll give you 10 times.

230
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,780
Here you go.

231
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,860
Wait a minute.

232
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,660
What?

233
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,260
I got two right answers.

234
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
What are you doing?

235
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
Look at this.

236
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,620
The rest of them are all wrong.

237
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,580
Hurry up and give me a new box.

238
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,520
I got it.

239
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,380
Here you go.

240
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,320
I won.

241
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,760
I got it.

242
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,080
10 times.

243
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll go all at once.

244
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,440
Oh.

245
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:10,680
Oh.

246
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,380
Oh.

247
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,640
Oh.

248
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,660
Oh.

249
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh.

250
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:13,980
How is it?

251
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,840
It's all wrong.

252
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,760
No way.

253
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,160
All right.

254
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,740
Good job.

255
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,640
You messed up with business, so I'll have to rearrange it next time.

256
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,320
What?

257
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,300
Rearrange it again?

258
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,980
Yeah.

259
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,360
Ryo!

260
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,840
Oh, it's you guys.

261
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,680
You guys? I won't get hit even if I come now.

262
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,500
Yeah. Anyway, I'll do my best.

263
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,200
I forgot.

264
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,340
Next.

265
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,660
It's for two.

266
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,160
Here you go.

267
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,320
I got it!

268
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,520
What?

269
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,420
Mr. Terae, you did it.

270
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,040
No, I can't believe it's so easy to hit.

271
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,720
Give me the note.

272
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,100
Yes.

273
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,880
Mr. Terae, please go ahead.

274
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:56,940
Yes.

275
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,560
Huh? I didn't get hit either.

276
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,820
What?

277
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,780
Why are you guys the only ones?

278
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,500
I'll beat you.

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,620
Yes.

280
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
Sorry, brother.

281
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,720
You're still young.

282
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
You still have a chance.

283
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Here's 10 times the money.

284
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,460
Try again with this.

285
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,040
See you.

286
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,640
Hey, you!

287
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,180
Damn it.

288
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,040
You cheated.

289
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,220
I lost unconsciously.

290
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,620
But I won't quit my duty.

291
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,620
Arigatou!

292
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,500
Let me get this off my chest.

293
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:44,900
Thank you, Mr. Terae.

294
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,500
I'll win.

295
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,560
Thanks to you, Mr. Terae.

296
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,460
You've done well.

297
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,700
You've done well.

298
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,920
I'll do my best.

299
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,380
I won't lose it.

300
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,760
Mr. Terae, did you like�

301
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,340
I did my best.

302
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,840
When I was young, I liked to play,

303
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,540
and now I'm in the game,

304
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,220
You're coming to eat on my trip, aren't you?

305
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,080
Excuse me, are you worried about Hachiro?

306
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,300
Well, my kid is...

307
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,340
Oh, me too! Let's do our best!

308
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,420
There's only one bat with three people, right?

309
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,260
I see, we're rivals.

310
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,340
Here, Umoji!

311
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,900
Okay, here we go!

312
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,160
Here, Terai-san!

313
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,320
It's the same time!

314
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,020
I'm sorry...

315
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Here we go!

316
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:29,860
I said it's for Hachiro!

317
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,900
I'll eat it too!

318
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,400
Now, push it!

319
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Here you go!

320
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,320
Alright!

321
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,400
Why are you eating ramen first?

322
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,420
I didn't draw the lottery!

323
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,760
Shut up! Get out of my way!

324
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,520
What the hell are you doing?

325
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,100
Somebody help me!

326
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,140
Hey, are you okay?

327
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,500
You can't go!

328
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,540
Sorry, but I'm going!

329
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,780
It's actually closer to the park than the park.

330
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,160
Thank you!

331
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Let go!

332
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,480
No!

333
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,280
Hachiro's bat is mine!

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,620
What you want is money, not a bat!

335
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,840
It's the same!

336
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,380
It's not the same at all!

337
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,960
Why does Nakagawa have to be so stubborn to Terai?

338
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,560
I just want Terai-san to win the first prize!

339
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,440
Alright, Nakagawa!

340
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,520
Hey, Hachiro!

341
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
Help me, both of you!

342
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,200
Terai-san?

343
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,940
My child is going to be born.

344
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,340
What?

345
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,080
The hospital is just over there.

346
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,940
Can you walk?

347
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,380
I can't walk anymore.

348
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,780
You can't walk?

349
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,920
Can't you walk?

350
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,120
Well, then, let's go!

351
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,680
Let's carry it together!

352
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,860
Senpai!

353
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
Are you okay?

354
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,880
What's this, Shiki?

355
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,780
Anyway, watch carefully so you don't fall off the bench.

356
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,040
Hang in there!

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,740
Okay, I'm here.

358
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,500
It's all right now.

359
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,980
Don't worry.

360
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,380
Oh, that's good.

361
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,840
Right, Senpai? Huh?

362
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,500
I see.

363
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,200
Hachiro was born in this hospital.

364
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,140
Terae-san, there's a stamp here too.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Huh? Terae-san?

366
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,240
Hang in there! Hang in there!

367
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,640
Inhale, exhale!

368
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,020
He, he, fu! He, he, fu!

369
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,260
It's fast!

370
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,260
How many kilometers is this?

371
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,840
150 kilometers.

372
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,900
Hachiro seems to have been practicing with a faster ball since junior high school.

373
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
150 kilometers?

374
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,880
Huh?

375
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,820
Can you hit a 5-ball ball this fast?

376
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,620
At least make it a 3-ball.

377
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,700
Okay.

378
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,460
Then, I'll take the 3-ball.

379
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,360
Instead, I'll buy a ball many times until I hit the 3-ball.

380
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,000
Damn it.

381
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,140
He took 100 yen with a 3-ball.

382
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,360
I don't know how much it will cost unless I hit it quickly.

383
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,080
As expected of you, you're good at both hands and legs.

384
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,980
You again?

385
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,200
Your bad luck ends here.

386
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,800
Alright, come on!

387
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,200
Now, let's see how you do.

388
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,500
Huh? What should I do if I can't hit a 150-kilometer ball of 160-kilometers?

389
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,640
How long will that strength last?

390
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,820
Well, let's see.

391
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,920
Ah, it's fast!

392
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,360
How is it? You don't even know how to do it, do you?

393
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
Well, that was a practice.

394
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,980
It's about time to put in the main body.

395
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,660
Huh?

396
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,780
Damn it!

397
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

398
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,100
What? The seniors are still here.

399
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,800
Yeah, they might catch up.

400
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,400
It's not that hard, but I can't hit it.

401
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,800
Alright, it's a bunt.

402
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Alright, this time for sure!

403
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,560
I won't lose!

404
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,060
Come on!

405
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,240
Ouch!

406
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,140
Ouch!

407
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,480
Ouch!

408
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,600
Huh?

409
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,720
I did it! I hit it!

410
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,880
Number six, you have two balls left.

411
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
You're amazing, Mr. Servant.

412
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,240
Hahaha, it's a bunt.

413
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,540
It's amazing that you can hit even with a bunt.

414
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,140
W-what do you mean, a bunt?

415
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,460
Ouch!

416
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,680
Ouch!

417
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,240
Ouch.

418
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,240
Ouch.

419
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,760
Ouch.

420
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,680
Ouch!

421
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,240
Ouch!

422
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,600
Ouch!

423
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,160
Ouch.

424
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,220
Ouch!

425
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,760
Ouch!

426
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,040
Ouch!

427
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
Ouch!

428
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,880
Ouch!

429
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,860
Ouch!

430
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,240
Ouch!

431
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,540
Ouch!

432
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:34,600
Ouch!

433
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,980
This is it!

434
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,460
You're amazing, Mr. Servant!

435
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,960
That's why I almost hit it.

436
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm sorry, seriously.

437
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
It's not the time to say that.

438
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,980
I got it.

439
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,560
I got this one too.

440
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,700
What are you doing? Even Senpai.

441
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,660
I can get Hachiro's autograph pad.

442
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,160
I can't change my mind.

443
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,100
I did it! All three balls hit!

444
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,100
Yes.

445
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,060
Thank you.

446
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,280
Have a good day!

447
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,800
What?

448
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,140
Welcome!

449
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,500
What's next?

450
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,640
Knock 30!

451
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,540
The one who picks up first wins!

452
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,400
Let's go!

453
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,340
Let's go!

454
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,080
One!

455
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,640
One!

456
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,500
Two!

457
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,080
Ten!

458
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,720
Thirty-three!

459
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,380
Twenty!

460
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Twenty-four!

461
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,380
Twenty-six!

462
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,720
Twenty-eight!

463
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,980
Twenty-eight!

464
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,680
Twenty-nine!

465
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,540
Twenty-nine!

466
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,460
Thirty!

467
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,440
All right! Three balls!

468
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,380
Thirty!

469
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,260
Give it to me!

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,600
Three!

471
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,940
It was just like that.

472
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,080
Three!

473
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,940
Three!

474
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,220
Three!

475
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,560
Three!

476
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,620
It's like a dream!

477
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:24,820
One ball!

478
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,000
One ball!

479
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,560
I can't do it any more.

480
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,440
Uwaaah!

481
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Ah! The handle!

482
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,380
Huh? The handle?

483
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,760
The bat... hit me.

484
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,180
God is watching you when you do something wrong.

485
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,400
Oh...

486
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,440
I was thinking of getting the first prize.

487
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,800
I wanted to make my son dream even if he's a bad father like me.

488
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,160
Huh? Ah...

489
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,000
If I work hard in life, the children might have dreams in the future!

490
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,140
Hurry up! Hurry up and go!

491
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,120
The others will catch up with you.

492
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,000
You have a child you want to make a dream come true, right?

493
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,720
Yes.

494
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
This...

495
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,880
Here you are.

496
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,480
What are you talking about?

497
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,460
Mr. Terai!

498
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,940
Let go of me!

499
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,680
Mr. Terai, hurry up!

500
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,080
See? I told you to hurry up!

501
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
That's for you...

502
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,780
Never mind. Run!

503
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:52,960
Run!

504
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,720
I won't let you go!

505
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,660
You're going to show your son your dream, aren't you?

506
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:00,920
Uh...

507
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,600
Yeah...

508
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,220
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,260
I'm sorry...

510
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm sorry.

511
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm sorry.

512
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,060
I can't believe you!

513
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,700
I can't believe you!

514
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,360
I can't believe you!

515
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,020
Congratulations!

516
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,400
It's the first prize of the winning producto, Hachiro!

517
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,940
It's the first prize of the winning product, Hachiro!

518
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,860
It's the first prize of the winning product, Hachiro!

519
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,660
You worked so hard,

520
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,620
I tried my best, but only the three-digit keychain?

521
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm sorry, Dad, I didn't get the three-digit keychain.

522
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,740
It's okay.

523
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,640
Well, you should go home.

524
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,560
Excuse me. Hey, wait a minute!

525
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,320
The first-class gentleman!

526
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,240
My son, Makoto.

527
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:41,980
Hello!

528
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,300
Hello.

529
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,460
He's my son, Kenji and Koji.

530
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,500
Hello!

531
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,600
Hello.

532
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,600
Hello.

533
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,640
Can I touch it?

534
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,740
Yeah!

535
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,900
Wow, amazing!

536
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,340
I'm really signing it!

537
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,300
Of course!

538
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you, or I'm sorry.

539
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,760
What should I say?

540
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,380
No, it's okay.

541
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,180
It's really okay.

542
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,460
Mr. Terai, you said you dropped your notebook,

543
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,900
but did you drop your own notebook to that person?

544
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,320
Have you noticed by now?

545
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,080
That's why I told you.

546
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,700
In the end, Terai is a life-saving man who does everything he can to help others.

547
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,220
Mr. Terai...

548
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,000
By the way, I haven't heard the reason why you betrayed me and joined Terai yet.

549
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,260
My father is a superman-like home run batter.

550
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,000
So?

551
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,700
My son might have wanted to say that he doesn't want to be a home run batter to his father.

552
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,760
That's all you?

553
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,340
Yes.

554
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,520
Just say it!

555
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,160
Ha-ha-ha!

556
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,420
Ha-ha-ha!

557
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,880
...

558
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,520
.

559
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,620
.

560
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,480
.

561
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,680
.

562
