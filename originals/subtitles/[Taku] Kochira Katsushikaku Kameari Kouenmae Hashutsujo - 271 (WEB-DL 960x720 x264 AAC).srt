1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,420
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job."

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,200
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job."

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,920
When you watch TV, make your room bright and try to look away.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,960
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job."

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,700
Those who have no money, come to me.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm worried.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,060
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,640
You'll get there somehow.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,760
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job."

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:57,860
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job."

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:17,460
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job.

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,560
You know what I mean?

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,720
I know.

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know, shut up and come to me.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,280
The End

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,040
The End

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,900
The End

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,380
The End

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,380
The End

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,200
The End

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,440
Good morning, Ryo-san!

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,920
Huh? What's up?

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,380
Ryo-san, did you eat mochi?

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,820
Mochi?

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,300
Yeah, it's New Year's Eve, but I haven't eaten any mochi.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,240
It's just leftover from the Osechi cuisine.

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,240
I'll cook you some mochi.

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:00,680
I'll cook you some mochi.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,460
Osechi cuisine, huh?

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
I used to have a strong desire to eat it on New Year's Eve.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
But I haven't had the time to do so lately.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,500
I haven't had the time to do so lately.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,800
I haven't had the time to do so lately.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,540
Okay, Ryo-san. Sorry to keep you waiting.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,080
Hey, I've got a good feeling about this.

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,280
Ryo-san, why don't you eat something?

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,220
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,020
Hmm, hmm.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,580
Japanese people love mochi.

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,800
Ryo-san, you're so full of food!

43
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,740
Is that so?

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,280
Oh, it's rare.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,760
It's a fairy tale.

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,100
Yamato Damashii Hozonkai

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Oh, it's real, huh?

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,700
Ah, it's my Japanese brother!

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,760
Lucky!

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,000
Lucky!

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,640
Japanese brother?

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,140
You're trying to protect the heart of Japan?

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,960
Let's use the correct Japanese this year as well.

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,900
Yes!

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,640
Then, the white-bearded old man has come.

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,300
Let's start.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,640
White-bearded old man?

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,560
A sacred legend from the north, the white-bearded old man has come.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,780
The white-bearded old man has come.

60
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,920
But I found aifique a girl who just came to give me a gift.

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,420
Shibame is the same as the white-bearded old man.

62
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:33,480
She don't know much about ingratitude.

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,900
His name is Sakuragawa.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,720
The white-bearded old man is not a anymore.

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,320
Oh, right here!

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,640
Is it a candle?

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,140
Really?

68
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,380
Yes

69
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,520
I know.

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,120
What kinda candy was this?

71
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,060
Sounds good.

72
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,940
Uh, Figure-san, hurry up.

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,180
Take care.

74
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Wait, wait a minute.

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,700
Please be more careful!

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,160
Too much, don't you think?

77
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,800
Um, oh my God.

78
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
Oh, did you eat something?

79
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes, yes, yes.

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,860
What does "Merry Christmas" mean?

81
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,760
It's too straightforward to understand.

82
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,680
Shinohige-ji-san put the new items in the children's bed,

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,160
which is sleeping soundly,

84
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,000
and went back to the north.

85
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,660
The children were very happy the next morning.

86
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,760
The eldest son, Taro, got the electronic camera he wanted.

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,260
The eldest daughter, Hanako, got the small-sized board for the morning girl.

88
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,900
The second son, Jiro, got the Western Kemari.

89
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,480
The third son, Kuro, got the Western Kemari.

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,120
The digital camera, the Moms CD, and the soccer ball?

91
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,180
That's what happens when you say it in Japanese.

92
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,280
It's a scale.

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,060
Why do you force yourself to translate it into Japanese?

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,880
To protect the heart of Japan, right?

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm sure you're trying to convey the wonderfulness of Japanese to the children.

96
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,300
Hmm...

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,900
That's good, good.

98
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,160
Now, to everyone who watched the paper play to the end,

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,260
let's give Ume-ama-ni-senbei.

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,400
Yeah!

101
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,160
Thank you, big brother.

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:51,800
Huh?

103
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,620
I also put up with it and watched until the end.

104
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,120
Why are we talking about Christmas now?

105
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,080
I didn't have time to talk about the New Year's Eve,

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,520
because it was something I made by hand.

107
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,960
But since it's New Year's Eve, I'll give you another New Year's ball today.

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,740
Yeah!

109
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,040
Here, take one of your favorite things.

110
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,540
Oh.

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,080
What is this?

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,820
It's a gift.

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,000
I was going to play with this one.

114
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,460
I'll try it on.

115
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,680
It's not a bad idea to play with toys of the past like this one.

116
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,780
Hey, this octopus looks weird.

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,320
Is it going to fly?

118
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,320
It's flying.

119
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,820
It's going to rise really high.

120
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,440
Look, it's stretching its tail like this...

121
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Ah!

122
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,840
It's tangled up again.

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,640
What?

124
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,820
Give it to me.

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,920
Christmas is the year of the octopus.

126
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,980
I guess it's the year of the octopus.

127
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,700
Have you ever had an octopus?

128
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,500
Yes!

129
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,680
No!

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,720
Huh?

131
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,440
There aren't many places to fry octopus now.

132
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,620
I was wrong about this.

133
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,980
I didn't know that this was happening to a turtle.

134
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,620
Alright, leave it to me!

135
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,500
Ray, are you ready?

136
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,780
I'm ready anytime, Onyo-san!

137
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,740
Here I go!

138
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,160
Alright, let go of my hand!

139
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,920
Wow!

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Look closely.

141
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,820
This is how you fry an octopus!

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
Wow!

143
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,800
Isn't it fun to fry an octopus?

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Yeah!

145
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,620
It's a good thing to do sometimes.

146
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,660
We're Japanese, so we should fry an octopus for New Year's.

147
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,940
You're young but you're great.

148
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,580
I'm impressed.

149
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,480
Our Japanese is in a state of crisis due to the spread of foreign language.

151
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,620
I want to protect the beautiful Japanese language and restore the culture and customs of Japan that has been forgotten.

152
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,800
Would you like to have a cup of warm tea?

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Huh?

154
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,560
Are you sure?

155
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
There's only me and Terai here.

156
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,580
I don't mind.

157
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,160
Happy New Year!

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,420
Here's your present!

159
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Um, this is...

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,220
I met her in the park over there.

161
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,520
My name is Fuzi Yamato.

162
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,400
Ah, hello.

163
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,740
Ha ha, it's delicious.

164
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,160
As I thought, Japanese people love Japanese tea.

165
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,400
Yeah, yeah!

166
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,160
This is a souvenir chocolate. Does it suit your taste?

167
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,920
In fact, this is a favorite, a traditional drink of Nangoku-san, a hot spring.

168
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,880
Oh.

169
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,560
Amazing.

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,580
-Amazing. -Isn't it?

171
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,560
Yamato-kun is good at speaking without using foreign languages.

172
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,940
I'm a big fan of Yamato.

173
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,960
If you say that, please say "he's really good at it".

174
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,040
Can you do anything in Japanese?

175
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,120
Yes, well...

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
Then, what do you call a plastic model?

177
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,420
It's a synthetic plastic assembly model.

178
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,940
What about the TV?

179
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,120
It's a box-shaped prototype.

180
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,580
Give it back!

181
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,660
What about this electric guitar?

182
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,480
It's a 6-core electric jamisen.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,840
Give it back!

184
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,480
What about canned coffee?

185
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,580
It's canned soy bean soup made in South America.

186
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,060
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,080
What are you doing?

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,380
What about the lighter?

189
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,360
It's a mobile phone manual lighter.

190
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,820
What about this head?

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,380
Take this.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
What about this?

193
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,840
Hey!

194
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,820
You can say anything in Japanese.

195
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,640
That's right.

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
It's so amazing.

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,520
Well, forget it.

198
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,680
What about this?

199
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,520
It's 300 yen!

200
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:52,980
What?

201
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,020
It's nothing.

202
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,400
For us, we think we've used too much English.

203
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,260
But this might be a good chance to try watching you in Japanese.

204
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,780
If you say so, we should come to you.

205
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,580
It's great!

206
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,620
Impressive. It's like a rare Japanese man's food.

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
It's not that bad.

208
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,980
It's cold.

209
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,160
Hey, Reiko. Do you still have the chocolate from the souvenir shop?

210
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,540
What are you talking about? I ate it all three days ago.

211
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,020
Oh, that was the last one.

212
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,960
I was going to give you food until the payday, but I should have given you a little more.

213
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm so tired.

214
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,840
Oh, Senpai, the person who came here the other day...

215
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,380
See, the person who's particular about Japanese has come to visit you.

216
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,480
Yamato? What do you mean?

217
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,620
Is the 6th floor around here? You're really down to earth.

218
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,220
It's all because of Yamato.

219
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,220
Ah, yes. It's this house.

220
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,500
Please!

221
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,420
Senpai, the times are changing.

222
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
You're so Japanese, aren't you?

223
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes!

224
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:03,920
Welcome.

225
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,560
Eh?

226
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,340
This is Yamato's house.

227
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,100
It's your turn, Nakagawa.

228
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,100
It's okay. I'm American, but I can speak Japanese fluently.

229
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,300
You're Yamato's friend, right?

230
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, thanks.

231
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,320
Could it be your god?

232
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes.

233
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,160
It's Catherine.

234
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,780
But I'm surprised.

235
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,820
Yamato's god, who hates foreigners, is American.

236
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,160
So I don't hate foreigners.

237
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,260
I look like an American, but I'm a Japanese with a strong personality.

238
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,380
You speak Japanese very well. When did you come to Japan?

239
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,720
I came to Japan for my first overseas trip when I was in college.

240
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,780
I moved here a year ago when I married Yamato.

241
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,440
I've loved Japan since I was a child.

242
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,180
I studied a lot in the past.

243
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,840
Your impressions of Japan are quite different, aren't they?

244
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,840
Yes.

245
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,120
Like this...

246
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,600
When did you come to Japan?

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
And then...

248
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,340
Hey, are you a Japanese?

249
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,000
But when I met Yamato at that time, he was the Japanese I thought.

250
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
He was serious and honest.

251
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
He was like a real Japanese man.

252
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,920
I fell in love at first sight.

253
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,180
I see.

254
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,640
It's a pleasant day at the beginning of the new year.

255
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,420
New Year is New Year's Day.

256
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,700
Japanese New Year's Day is Takoage, Hanetsuki, Komamawashi.

257
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,680
It's a wind.

258
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Nowadays, only the inside shops of Asakusa or Tokyo Tower sell things like this in Japan.

259
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,700
That's right.

260
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,640
So we want to give the children a little bit of the wonderfulness of Japan.

261
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,440
Yamato taught children how to play in the past while working.

262
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,400
I teach children how to play solo.

263
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,900
She wrote the words of the octopus.

264
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
It's better than me.

265
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,640
I can't read your words.

266
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm looking forward to the day when I'll have takoage with Yamato.

267
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,420
If it's takoage, it's the day of the paper play.

268
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,180
That day was very windy.

269
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,520
The humidity was low and the crows were not crying.

270
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Yamato said it wasn't takoage.

271
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,780
What?

272
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,260
Let's have takoage together next year.

273
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,980
Yes.

274
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,560
Yamato is very good at takoage.

275
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
Right, Yamato?

276
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,260
Yes.

277
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,860
By the way, did you call us to brag about the beautiful god?

278
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,740
Close it.

279
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,620
Yes.

280
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,300
What?

281
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,420
Yes.

282
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,100
Please.

283
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
Is this the ninja mansion?

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,040
This is.

285
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,320
What?

286
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,280
What's this?

287
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,120
What is this?

288
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,040
OMG.

289
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,700
Oh my God!

290
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,880
Yamato?

291
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,000
Not found!

292
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,880
I've been looking for it, but I can't find it!

293
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,020
I just got Michael Jordan's signed shoes!

294
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,680
Calm down!

295
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,360
What's going on with you?

296
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,140
Oh, that's right!

297
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,960
I've been a typical Japanese guy who loves America since I was a kid.

298
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,680
Basketball, football, candy, Hollywood, rock and roll!

299
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,460
America only!

300
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,900
Viva America!

301
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm a big fan of America!

302
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,640
Why is he doing something like that to protect the heart of Japan?

303
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah, it's just a habit.

304
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,480
Catherine likes Japan as it is.

305
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,440
I think the same way.

306
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm not going to let this happen!

307
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,040
Chikara.

308
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,660
Welcome.

309
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,420
Three years ago in the summer, I was working part-time at a pub to save money for my trip to America.

310
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,880
Then I was sent there.

311
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,040
I happened to see Catherine passing by.

312
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,460
Wow.

313
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,360
Wow.

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,700
Wow.

315
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:32,820
Wow.

316
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,440
I fell in love at first sight!

317
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,620
I believe Catherine is the mirror of the Japanese man.

318
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Why?

319
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,120
Why?

320
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,420
Why?

321
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,560
Why?

322
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,780
Why?

323
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,520
That's why I'm traveling to America.

324
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Now I'm the owner of a pub.

325
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm the owner of a pub.

326
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,100
Chuhai, Umesawa, Nikujaga, you know!

327
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,280
I'm not a fan of Catherine, who likes Japanese beauty.

328
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm not a fan of Catherine, who likes Japanese beauty.

329
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,860
I'm not a fan of Catherine, who likes Japanese beauty.

330
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,360
So when I was having a strange fantasy about Japanese men, I was not involved in her.

331
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,900
I hid myself in her.

332
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,340
I started to take in the boyishness of her.

333
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,100
She'll divorce me if she finds out about this.

334
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,760
No way.

335
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,840
Can you continue in your life?

336
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,660
This is my America.

337
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,700
If I come out of this, I will become fiery for Catherine.

338
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,580
I'll do my best.

339
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,200
Uh!

340
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,900
Ah!

341
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,100
The hole...

342
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,260
It's here!

343
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm sure there's an empty space in here!

344
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,940
So, the shoes of the most precious person, Michael Jordan...

345
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,340
Shit! Unbelievable!

346
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
Come back, Michael!

347
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,100
Mr. Ryo, please!

348
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,660
Please take my treasure back!

349
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
I get it, I get it!

350
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,460
Calm down!

351
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
What were you talking about, Yamato?

352
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,880
Well, it's a man and woman thing.

353
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:17,580
Huh? The empty space is being captured!

354
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,140
Mr. Ryo!

355
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
I've been wandering around here for a while

356
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,540
and I've been bored.

357
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,320
I've been trying to get down from my neck.

358
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,880
Here, take this.

359
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,680
Thank you very much!

360
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,580
I'm so glad.

361
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,140
Yamato, are you back?

362
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,780
I forgot something.

363
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,680
I'll be back soon.

364
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,540
Are you all right, Yamato?

365
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,260
How long are you going to keep doing this?

366
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,720
You'll find out someday.

367
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,280
Even the gods who believe in you won't see you.

368
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,540
I'll talk to you someday.

369
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,440
I see.

370
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,420
Bye.

371
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,580
What's wrong?

372
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,020
Um, can you teach me how to make takoage?

373
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,760
I've never made it before.

374
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,020
It's cheap.

375
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,640
See you later.

376
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,360
Thank you very much.

377
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,660
Yamato?

378
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,640
What's this?

379
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,180
Is this your room?

380
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,140
No, this is...

381
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,920
Yamato, did you like basketball?

382
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,620
Well...

383
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,260
Um...

384
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
Um...

385
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,580
Did you like Michael Jordan,

386
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,900
Karin and Eastwood?

387
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
Catherine, that's...

388
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,980
Did you lie to me that you like Chiyonofuji and Takakura Ken?

389
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,340
Did you lie to me that you don't need anything else

390
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,960
but natto and pickles?

391
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,720
That's right!

392
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,660
I'm not a Japanese-style man.

393
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,600
I prefer hamburgers to rice.

394
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,100
I don't like sweet painful taste.

395
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,980
I've always been wondering why you were hiding something from me.

396
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,560
Why didn't you tell me?

397
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,680
If I tell you the truth,

398
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't think I'd be able to say anything to you.

399
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,100
What about you, Yamato?

400
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,860
Did you marry me because I'm an American?

401
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,800
Did I have the same collection as you?

402
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,180
No.

403
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:19,900
No.

404
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm not that kind of woman!

405
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm just sad that Yamato lied to me!

406
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,240
Idiot!

407
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,200
Catherine!

408
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,560
Catherine!

409
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,140
Catherine!

410
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,780
Catherine...Catherine is out!

411
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:46,920
She's out!

412
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,900
Did you find out?

413
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,900
Yes...

414
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,720
I searched all around the school, but she's not here!

415
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,060
Please help me!

416
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,520
I can't live without Catherine!

417
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,440
Yeah, I know. Hang in there!

418
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,540
You didn't go back to America, did you?

419
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,140
C-Catherine!

420
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,300
It's all my fault. I was stupid.

421
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,660
I couldn't play takoyaki with Catherine after all.

422
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,280
That's right! That's what happened!

423
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,380
Huh?

424
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,660
Yamato...

425
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,920
No! Please stop!

426
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,580
Don't say that! Let's go play together, sis!

427
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,140
It's fine!

428
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,020
Just one drink is enough!

429
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,480
Excuse me!

430
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,900
What's wrong, bro?

431
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,620
One more?

432
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,660
How about we drink at home?

433
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
The food is the best!

434
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
And we have alcohol too!

435
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,740
Alcohol?

436
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,920
Yes!

437
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,480
The legendary drink, "Otokozakari Kippon" is available!

438
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,780
Please have a drink!

439
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,840
Otokozakari?

440
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,480
Sounds good!

441
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,160
Hehe...

442
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,100
Thank you!

443
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,540
You're welcome.

444
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,720
Hm?

445
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:35,300
Long time no see.

446
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Catherine!

447
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,620
You're late!

448
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

449
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,940
I couldn't get off work.

450
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,060
Are you angry?

451
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,340
No.

452
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
This way!

453
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:05,860
Here! I forgot this place!

454
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,520
Alright, let's go!

455
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,480
Yeah!

456
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,740
Alright!

457
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,960
Here we go!

458
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,060
Here comes a nice breeze!

459
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,840
Let's go all together!

460
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,300
Okay, Junpei and Kanpei!

461
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,740
You go, too!

462
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,200
Alright!

463
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,140
Yeah!

464
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,020
Don't race!

465
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,960
Pull the string!

466
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,200
Good!

467
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,420
Next!

468
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,040
Can I go now?

469
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,380
Yes!!

470
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,620
Ready?

471
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,040
Wow, you're amazing.

472
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,260
That's right.

473
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,000
It's not the time to be happy.

474
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,020
Yamato, it's your turn next!

475
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,920
Be brave!

476
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,900
Yes!

477
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,180
Good luck, Yamato-kun!

478
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,700
Okay!

479
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,700
Hurray!

480
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,680
Okay? I'll let you go!

481
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,420
Okay!

482
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,200
Pull the string!

483
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,180
Don't be hasty!

484
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
Pull the string as it is!

485
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,220
Put the octopus on the wind!

486
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,860
I did it!

487
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,800
I got it!

488
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,780
Okay!

489
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,980
It's looking good!

490
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,000
It's looking good!

491
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,780
One, two, line up!

492
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,780
Yamato, you go to the other end!

493
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,140
You go between Junpei-kun and Pappe-kun!

494
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,960
Don't let the string get tangled!

495
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,620
Yamato, God is watching!

496
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:52,780
I'm watching!

497
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,660
Wow...

498
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
Catherine...

499
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
Catherine!

500
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,640
This is how I feel!

501
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,420
What?

502
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
I...

503
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,900
I... love...

504
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,920
I... love... you...

505
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,580
I love... you...

506
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,360
I love... you...

507
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,240
I love... you...

508
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,780
I love you!

509
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,260
I'm glad you came out of nowhere.

510
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,140
Thanks, Captain.

511
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,840
I'll help you to the table, so be prepared.

512
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,340
Thank you, sir, for asking me to work for you.

513
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
I'll help you to the table, since we'll have an open gate tomorrow.

514
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,960
Thank you, Captain, for your help today!

515
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,100
Thank you, Captain!

516
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,180
Thanks, Captain, for your help today!

517
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:43,940
Thank you for your help today!

518
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,560
" AMAZING CHAKAN, Monster"

519
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,060
Thank you!

520
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,360
Thank you, Captain!

521
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,600
Thank you, Captain!

522
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:15,560
Why, why, why, why, why?

523
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,740
Ryo, why?

524
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,000
Why?

525
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,100
Ryo's eyebrows look like black black eyes

526
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,160
Why?

527
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,500
He wears sandals but he runs really fast

528
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,900
Why?

529
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,280
Ryo always does arm curls

530
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,460
Why?

531
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,460
He's so flirty but everyone adores him

532
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:44,980
Why?

533
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,740
It doesn't matter

534
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:57,820
But the title of this anime is so long

535
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,840
Katsushikaku Kameari Park, here

536
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,360
Why?

537
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,200
Why?

538
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,420
Everyone together

539
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,220
Why?

540
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,540
Why?

541
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,780
Why?

542
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,300
Why?

543
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,120
Why?

544
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,780
Why?

545
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:32,040
You're here again, Professor Tondemo

546
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,840
What? A mask?

547
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,040
You can make any face with this?

548
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,760
It's like the double-faced Kaijin

549
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,400
Okay

550
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,040
Okay, we'll play with it

551
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,640
Next time, Ryo's double-faced Kaijin

552
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,140
Thanks for watching

553
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,820
Please subscribe to our channel!

554
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
