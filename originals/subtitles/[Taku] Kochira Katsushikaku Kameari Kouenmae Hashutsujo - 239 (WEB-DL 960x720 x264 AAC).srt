1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Gengar's

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,860
When you are watching TV, make your room bright and look away.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,740
If you have no money, come to me.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't have money, but I am worried.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,960
See the blue sky, the white clouds

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,180
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:55,420
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

8
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,820
Come to me, you who have no job

9
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm not here, but don't worry

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,380
Look, it's burning

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,400
Red clouds

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,160
Red clouds

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,640
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,600
You know, don't you?

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,300
I know, I know

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,780
If you know, shut up and follow me

17
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:41,980
I was saved

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,040
If you know, don't remember

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,760
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,980
But now that you have an idea, you can't go back now

21
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,840
I can't even do anything

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,240
I don't have anything to do with anything

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,420
I'm going out

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:11,180
Don't follow me

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,200
Senpai!

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,600
What are you doing in someone's house?

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,380
This is a garbage collection place.

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,520
Oh, I see. You got drunk and slept here.

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,520
You were doing the 20th New Year's Eve party until the new year.

30
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,520
New Year's Eve is already in April.

31
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,460
But why is your uniform so worn out?

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,180
Don't you remember?

33
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,600
Dog hair. Oh, right. I remember fighting three dogs.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,920
You're acting too much.

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,540
By the way, why are you wearing your uniforms to work?

36
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,220
Oh, no, Senpai. Did you forget?

37
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,220
The manager said to wear his uniform tomorrow.

38
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,420
Well, that's right.

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
That's great. Let's change into the locker's uniforms and throw them away.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,340
What? Throw away the uniforms?

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,760
What? I don't want to be taken away for a few days.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,160
What? I don't want to be taken away for a few days.

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,540
What? I don't want to be taken away for a few days.

44
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,920
I have no other choice but to let you all gather in uniform.

45
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,140
Recently, the Aki-su is in the Shokatsu-kannai of the Katsushika-shō.

46
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,120
I want you to patrol in your uniforms and be careful of anything suspicious.

47
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,120
Hey, Ryōtsu!

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,560
Yes?

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,580
No, you idiot. I'm not asking you.

50
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:33,680
Are you listening?

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,540
Yes, I am.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,440
Don't make a loud noise.

53
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,180
It will echo in your head.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,560
I woke you up because you were sleeping standing up.

55
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,480
Listen.

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,920
If you skip your uniform because it's your uniform, you'll be punished.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,760
I know.

58
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,440
Yes, yes.

59
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:03,900
Listen.

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,080
How dare you!

61
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,560
I hate it when strangers step on my feet!

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
You are an outlaw.

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,340
What a mess.

64
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,180
What's wrong?

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,340
You're here too.

66
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,700
Again!?

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,280
It's so lame...

68
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,280
Ah, I still have to sleep like this.

69
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,600
With this I can get to work without worry.

70
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,280
What!?

71
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,060
Bad!!

72
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,020
Bad, bad! Someone's coming!

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,860
What's that?

74
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,820
A wet blanket?

75
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh- I mean, s...

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,720
Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,800
Ah, it was wet after all.

78
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,480
Just a moment, okay?

79
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,700
Now, this is good.

80
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,300
Don't cry anymore.

81
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,380
It's not the time to change the toilet.

82
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,020
Hey, Yamashita-san.

83
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm collecting the newspaper.

84
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,200
Eh, the key wasn't locked?

85
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,060
Yes, I knocked, but there was no answer.

86
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,120
What a good house.

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,640
Here's the newspaper.

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
For two months.

89
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,960
Ah, am I paying for it?

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,460
Of course.

91
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,640
Who else will pay for it?

92
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, of course.

93
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Damn it.

94
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,160
Thank you.

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Damn it.

96
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,420
Why am I paying for it?

97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
Ah, the laundry!

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,420
Why am I doing this?

99
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,840
Damn it.

100
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,580
Oh, he kept taking out the laundry.

101
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,480
He came back!

102
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,260
It's raining and I'm sleepy.

103
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm sure I'll have a good rest on this day.

104
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,860
I'm done for today.

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,000
Huh?

106
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,180
Let's have a drink.

107
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,640
Here you go.

108
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:00,940
Ouch.

109
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,560
Ouch.

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm gonna die.

111
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
What's wrong?

112
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,780
You're so poor that you're sighing.

113
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,020
Huh?

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,700
I don't know what happened,

115
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,220
but if you look like that, you'll run away from the moon.

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
That's right.

117
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm a great person.

118
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,920
I'm so jealous of everything I do.

119
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm jealous of everything I do.

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,260
I'm confident in my skills.

121
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,160
But I'm a coward, so I've never done well.

122
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,060
Don't be so nervous.

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,260
You'll get better.

124
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,160
I'll get better?

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Yeah.

126
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,560
Men need courage and sometimes recovery.

127
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,880
Recovery...

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,220
You have to act rather than worry.

129
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Open the door and we'll have a straight fight.

130
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,860
Ah, but...

131
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,740
I always go to the good places and get in the way.

132
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,660
Well, there's always a way to get in the way.

133
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,860
But when you get over it and succeed,

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,320
you'll be happy.

135
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
I see.

136
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,600
That's so convincing.

137
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,600
I have to learn from it.

138
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,860
That's right.

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,780
If you're afraid of failure, you won't be a big deal.

140
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,340
Ugh, that's bad.

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,100
Huh?

142
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,020
I saw it.

143
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,600
That was Ryo-tsu.

144
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,300
Can I talk to him again?

145
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
No, just take a look.

146
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,460
Ugh.

147
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,280
You have to work hard.

148
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,940
You're awesome, Can I talk to him?

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,640
...

150
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,060
What, no.

151
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,220
I'm going to get back at him.

152
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,160
Excuse me.

153
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,740
Is that Tatsumiya?

154
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,460
What?

155
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,780
Oh, you're not Tatsumiya.

156
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,340
Oh, right.

157
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,980
There's a guy in the corner with fibers and glasses.

158
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,540
A male?

159
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,080
Oh, is he King Tatsumiya?

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,280
You saved me! You're a good person! I'm grateful to you!

161
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm Ryotsu!

162
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,420
I'm Mameda!

163
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,540
My husband is related to that place.

164
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
Oh? Haha, well.

165
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,860
That's how I feel.

166
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,540
He has a strange name.

167
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,740
Well, I don't know anyone in this neighborhood.

168
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,900
I've learned!

169
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm going to take a look at Mr. Ryotsu and have a manly fight!

170
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,720
It's that spirit!

171
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,720
Good luck!

172
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,800
I'll do it!

173
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,760
I'll succeed this time!

174
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,000
There's nothing that was taken.

175
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,660
I took the laundry and ironed it.

176
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,600
The dishes were also washed clean.

177
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,480
Oh, there's a strange man.

178
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,740
Did something happen to Kei?

179
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,380
No, nothing special.

180
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,120
How about Ryo?

181
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
Is he doing it properly?

182
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,100
Well, I wonder.

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,880
Well, he's a senior.

184
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,700
I'll do it!

185
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,520
I'll do it this time!

186
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,780
Oh?

187
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,100
He moved!

188
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,120
All right, I'll help him.

189
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,160
Yes, that!

190
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,740
Please give it to me.

191
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,280
Thank you.

192
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,280
It's heavy!

193
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Is there something lighter and more expensive?

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Oh, is this it!?

195
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,300
What!?

196
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,840
Uh!

197
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,980
Have you been frightened?

198
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,720
What?

199
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,520
Um,命績 Advice...

200
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,740
For acquaintances ?

201
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,740
No, it's ridiculous!

202
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,960
I see. No, no.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm interested in helping you!

204
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,940
Oh, it was like that!

205
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,940
I'll help again!

206
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,740
The noisy one is here!

207
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,620
Why are you hiding too?

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,360
Well, I was just caught by Ryouku-san.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,420
You're going?

210
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,160
Yes.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,160
Then I'll go.

212
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,380
Let's have another drink.

213
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,080
Yes.

214
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,860
I'll be good too.

215
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,180
I'll do it.

216
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,000
Everyone, take a break!

217
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,440
I did it!

218
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,300
I succeeded!

219
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,700
What's this?

220
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,900
It's a plum blossom jar!

221
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,480
Why did you steal it?

222
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm such a bad guy.

223
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,320
Ryou's wife must be cheating on him.

224
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,100
Chiki-chan.

225
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,220
It's not safe to see you looking drunk.

226
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,160
By the way,

227
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,760
don't you know that we should be careful about Kisu,

228
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,680
or that we need to be careful about Ryou?

229
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,540
Thanks everyone!

230
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,720
When you move,

231
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920
you can set up another thing.

232
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,980
Yes, I'll take care of it.

233
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,060
Hey, where's that plum blossom jar?

234
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,100
Well,

235
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,180
Eh? You don't have it?

236
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,420
Eh? You did! I don't know!

237
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,200
Maybe it was in the truck!

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Why a plum blossom pot?

239
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,640
It's money!

240
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,320
It's not in the truck.

241
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,140
Eh?

242
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,700
No way...

243
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,100
Did you forget to fill it up?

244
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,320
Sorry.

245
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,600
Is there something wrong?

246
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
I heard he forgot to fill it up!

247
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,580
The plum blossom pot?

248
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,800
Is it that important?

249
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,640
There are 30,000,000 yen in it!

250
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,840
What did you say? 30,000,000?

251
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,100
It's money!

252
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,360
No, no!

253
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,440
The amount is too high...

254
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm scared!

255
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,720
Hmm...

256
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,340
N-No, it's nothing!

257
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,140
Could it be... that guy?

258
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,580
Anyway, let's go back there.

259
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,380
If we don't have the money, what should we do?

260
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,380
H-Hey!

261
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,360
Huh?

262
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,300
It's a year's money!

263
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,320
You!

264
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,060
Yeah!

265
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,500
I dropped this memo case.

266
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,320
Thank you very much!

267
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,360
Thank you!

268
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,500
I found it!

269
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,460
You saved me!

270
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,880
How can I thank you?

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,000
N-No, it's nothing.

272
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,120
Then, I'll take this.

273
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,360
Wait!

274
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,040
What a shameless person.

275
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,780
Should I take it instead of him?

276
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,960
That's none of your business.

277
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
I knew it.

278
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,500
Ah!

279
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,440
How can I

280
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,920
make money with such a tiny tree?

281
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,160
I can't believe it.

282
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,120
Maybe next time...

283
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,100
I'll just catch up to him

284
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,140
after I get the money.

285
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,520
*Growl*

286
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,980
*Growl*

287
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,020
*Growl*

288
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,720
*Growl*

289
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,080
*Growl*

290
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,460
*Growl*

291
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,280
*Growl*

292
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,960
*Growl*

293
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,180
*Growl*

294
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,200
*Growl*

295
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,640
Who's this guy?

296
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,780
What's up?

297
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,980
Eh?

298
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,860
Eh?

299
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:47,960
Eh?

300
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,580
Um...

301
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,080
He's my father's friend.

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,620
I came all the way here to see him.

303
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,400
Your father's dead?

304
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,580
Eh?

305
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,200
Ah, y-yeah!

306
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,180
My mother's photo is also with another relative's cousin next to him.

307
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,800
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

308
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
Your mother is sick and is in hospital.

309
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,920
What?

310
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,880
Ah, ah, ah...

311
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,180
I'm a bit dizzy.

312
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,560
C-Captain!

313
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,980
I knew it would come to this!

314
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,000
How well do you patrol!

315
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,440
No, captain, I'm just a part of the team.

316
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,540
No excuses.

317
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,420
The patrol's over, so go to Mr. Tanaka's house and see how he's doing.

318
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,780
Only the children are in there after your mother's hospitalization.

319
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,420
Right?

320
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,700
Yeah.

321
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,100
*Squeak*

322
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,000
*Squeak*

323
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,120
*Squeak*

324
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,160
I see.

325
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,660
So that's why there are only the children.

326
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,340
It's been windy for a while.

327
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,820
Hey, is your home okay?

328
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't know.

329
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,560
I'm just a little sick.

330
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,440
*Gasp*

332
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,880
*Gasp*

333
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,820
*Gasp*

334
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:56,860
*Gasp*

335
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,380
Did you have a rain shower?

336
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,060
Huh?

337
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,680
Did you get wet?

338
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,000
R-Ryotsu-san...

339
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Ah, I see.

340
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,000
You're the only one with children here.

341
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,220
Well, that's true.

342
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
*Bang*

343
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
*Bang*

344
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,440
*Bang*

345
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,640
We haven't heard anything since I left the prison.

346
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,580
Hey, is everybody in here?

347
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,900
Everybody gather!

348
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,240
Ichiro the eldest son.

349
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,340
Matsuko the eldest daughter.

350
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,620
Jiro the youngest son.

351
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,940
Takeko the oldest daughter.

352
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,240
Umeko the youngest.

353
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,200
Oh, Saburo isn't here.

354
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,940
Huh? Where is he?

355
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,920
He was at the kitchen earlier.

356
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,160
Huh?

357
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,060
*Dang*

358
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,980
*希*

359
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,600
You're a little too much.

360
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,100
You're a little too much.

361
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,920
I'm going to play with you.

362
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm going to play with you.

363
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,680
I'm going to find a new clothes.

364
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,460
You wash these guys in the bathroom.

365
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,900
You wash these guys in the bathroom.

366
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,980
Mr. Ryo.

367
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,840
When are you going to work?

368
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,480
You put these guys in the bathroom.

369
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,180
You put these guys in the bathroom.

370
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,880
Then you fix the roof.

371
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,740
Fix the roof?

372
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,580
The antenna is about to fall.

373
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,180
The roof is about to fall.

374
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,840
See you later.

375
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:24,540
It's raining and windy.

376
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,700
Really?

377
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,520
Everyone worked hard.

378
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,900
The postman in Akitsu was caught

379
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,840
by the police.

380
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm glad.

381
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,880
Is the senior still here?

382
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,380
I told him a special mission.

383
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,520
Special mission?

384
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,860
Special mission?

385
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,440
Hold it tight.

386
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,860
My legs are slippery.

387
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,080
What's that?

388
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay.

389
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,120
Tighten that wire more tightly.

390
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,440
Yes.

391
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,580
Tighten that wire more tightly.

392
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,440
Tighten that wire more tightly.

393
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,200
Next is the his head.

394
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,300
Oh, you're pretty good at this.

395
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,380
Oh, you're pretty good at this.

396
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,320
Mr. Ryo,

397
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
When will you start?

398
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,840
When?

399
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,100
Oh, when the kids go to bed.

400
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, I see.

401
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,440
You should cure your child.

402
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,240
You should cure your child.

403
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,820
You should cure your child.

404
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,340
Um...

405
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah!

406
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,520
Ah! I lost again!

407
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,440
Uncle is weak!

408
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,900
Hey!

409
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
Do you have any more rice?

410
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,160
Yes, I have.

411
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,680
Oh, a pot? That's nice.

412
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,580
Yes!

413
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,120
I made it with the right ingredients.

414
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,920
How is it?

415
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,460
Is it good?

416
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,400
Uncle, I'll take care of it!

417
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,200
I'll take care of it!

418
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,120
I'll go first!

419
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,680
Yes, yes, one by one!

420
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,480
Yes, everyone seems to be asleep.

421
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,700
Yes!

422
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,120
Let's do it!

423
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,920
Huh?

424
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,220
Hmm...

425
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
Hmm...

426
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Hmm...

427
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,980
But the world is unfair, isn't it?

428
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,780
Hmm?

429
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,100
Even if we work hard,

430
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,340
we can't make a living.

431
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,240
Even if we work hard, we can't make a living.

432
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,900
I think it's good to cheat people

433
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,980
and cheat people.

434
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
But men

435
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,060
live positively.

436
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,340
If you have a naked body,

437
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,820
you can do anything.

438
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,080
I think so.

439
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,800
But...

440
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,960
It's important to change the world

441
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,180
before you say anything.

442
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,320
If you're born with a man in this world,

443
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,380
you have to do something.

444
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,400
Oh, as a man...

445
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh, as a man...

446
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm going to sleep now.

447
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm going to sleep now.

448
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,100
Ouch!

449
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,340
It's 5,000 yen...

450
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,380
It's 5,000 yen...

451
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,180
It's 5,000 yen...

452
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,520
Men are stupid.

453
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,660
Sometimes you need to be healed.

454
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,840
Heal...

455
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
Heal...

456
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,580
You have to act rather than worry.

457
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,400
You have to act rather than worry.

458
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,780
You have to act rather than worry.

459
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,380
You have to act rather than worry.

460
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,880
Because if you eat the same yakis,

461
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,340
you will be eaten or eaten.

462
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,340
You have to eat or be eaten.

463
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,980
You have to eat or be eaten.

464
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,840
Police officer?

465
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,100
Police officer?

466
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,700
You look like a criminal.

467
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,800
You look like a criminal.

468
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,860
Huh?

469
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Where are you going, uncle?

470
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,020
Where are you going, uncle?

471
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,860
To the toilet.

472
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,460
I'm going, too.

473
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,040
Take me.

474
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,220
I'm going, too.

475
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,160
Take me.

476
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,520
Here.

477
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,060
Take me.

478
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,960
Before she leaves...

479
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,920
Before she leaves...

480
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,040
What?

481
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,340
What?

482
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,640
The stream is flooded.

483
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,300
What?

484
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
Huh?

485
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,780
Wow.

486
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,020
Grandpa?

487
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,760
If this overflows, the children will...

488
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,240
I... I...

489
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,220
Grandpa!

490
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,320
Where are you, grandpa?

491
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,620
Grandpa!

492
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,180
Grandpa!

493
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,520
Grandpa!

494
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,560
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

495
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,380
Yeah.

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,340
Grandpa's gone.

497
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,400
Grandpa!

498
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,140
Grandpa, are you going somewhere?

499
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,680
Don't go!

500
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,920
I'm sorry. I'm not going anywhere.

501
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,860
I'll be with you forever.

502
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,020
Hey.

503
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,700
I thought you'd come back.

504
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,460
Mr. Ryozu...

505
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,840
Did you know who I am?

506
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Who am I?

507
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,240
I'm a kind old man who likes children.

508
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,560
Mr. Ryozu...

509
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,340
Come on, come on.

510
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,680
If you stand there, you'll catch a cold.

511
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,680
Okay.

512
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,140
Great

513
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,900
No, you have nothing to lose, huh?

514
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,140
Yup.

515
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,420
As expected, a new uniform feels good.

516
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,900
Mr. Ryozu!

517
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,860
Yeah.

518
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,100
What is it going on?

519
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,280
The other day,

520
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,660
I finally found the perfect job for me.

521
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,700
Hahaha.

522
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,460
You're a home helper, aren't you?

523
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,960
That's right. I've never noticed that there's a job that feels this way.

524
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,480
I see. Perfect. Do it well.

525
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,400
Yes. Now, I'm going home.

526
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,780
Yeah.

527
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,220
You don't look like it, but you're a good friend, Ryo-san.

528
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,540
What? I'm just a drinking buddy.

529
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,020
Let's go home.

530
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,040
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

531
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,180
I don't want to be someone who's playing games with luxuries.

532
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,860
If you're blocking my way at the corner of the bend,

533
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,440
I won't share with anyone but you.

534
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,580
The moon has escaped

535
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,640
Now isn't everything

536
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,900
Don't worry too much

537
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,680
Even if you lie and cheat

538
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,160
You're helping someone, sometimes

539
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,440
Baby, do you know me?

540
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,360
I'm heading for tomorrow

541
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,700
With a nice breath

542
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,540
Don't be sick

543
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,720
I'll do what I have to do

544
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,920
A heart-pounding breath

545
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,920
What is hard to understand

546
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,360
I want to show you

547
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,740
It's better than nothing

548
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Ah, I'm sure it's a turtle

549
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,840
Everyone, come to our town

550
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,000
Thank you!
