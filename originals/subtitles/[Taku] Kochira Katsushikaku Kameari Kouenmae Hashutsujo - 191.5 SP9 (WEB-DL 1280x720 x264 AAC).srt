Festival of

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,740
It's lively.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,180
Well, when it comes to a festival, it's always lively.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,380
Senpai knows about the festivals in Tokyo.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,280
Oh, look inside.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,780
Yes.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,860
Yes.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,100
Yes.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,840
Yes.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,200
Yes.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,360
Yes.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,840
Yes.

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,520
It's lively.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,040
Especially the second one from the left is good.

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,100
Is it that girl?

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,620
Yes.

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,920
Yes.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,500
Yes.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,040
Yes.

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,540
Yes.

23
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,720
Yes.

24
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,300
Yes.

25
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,800
Yes.

26
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,660
Yes.

27
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:52,700
Yes.

28
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:52,880
Yes.

29
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,380
Yes.

30
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,500
Yes.

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,280
Yes.

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,600
Yes.

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,160
Yes.

34
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,280
Yes.

35
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,180
Yes.

36
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Yes.

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,100
Yes.

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,380
Yes.

39
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,460
Yes.

40
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,740
Yes.

41
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,300
Yes.

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,200
Yes.

43
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,260
Yes.

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,320
Yes.

45
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,960
Yes.

46
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,980
Yes.

47
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Ah! That woman!

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,620
What the hell are you doing?!

49
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,220
Don't mess with me!

50
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,860
Where are the idiots who step on the holy amikoshi?!

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,140
I don't know where you're coming from, but get out of here!

52
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Oh! That's good, sis!

53
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,420
You!

54
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,300
Wait a minute!

55
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,580
I see! This right hand is the bad one!

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,060
W-W-What the hell are you doing?!

57
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,880
I want you to do more!

58
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Hey!

59
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,660
I-I'm screwed!

60
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,180
There are many guys at festivals!

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,420
Be careful not to get hurt!

62
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,960
Hey, Nagawa!

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,600
Yes!

64
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,460
See you later!

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,960
I've seen him before!

66
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,480
He comes to the Kanda Festival every year!

67
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,880
He loves festivals!

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,340
He's a fan of Tokyo!

69
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,260
I think he's wearing a holy amikoshi!

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,520
It's the famous Ryotsukan Kichi of the Katsushika Shrine!

71
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,580
The Katsushika Shrine?

72
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,960
Big news! Big news!

73
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,820
What's wrong, Terai?

74
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,900
Did you win a thousand yen in the lottery?

75
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,100
Why is that the big news?

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm a small townie!

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:00,840
If you're a small townie,

78
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,780
you can't make it that big!

79
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,220
No way!

80
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,100
So, Terai, what is the big news?

81
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,620
Right.

82
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,340
Actually, I've heard it in the book,

83
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,620
but it seems like the new minister has been dismissed today!

84
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,020
Oh.

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,160
So what kind of person is he?

86
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,720
He's a very very beautiful 19-year-old!

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,940
Very very beautiful?

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,540
That's what the book says!

89
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,780
I can't expect much from him,

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
but it's worth seeing him!

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,260
Let's go inside!

92
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,660
Oh, Senpai!

93
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,780
Oh, he's gone!

94
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,700
Well then, Terai, see you later!

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,120
What?

96
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,300
Even Reiko?

97
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,760
Huh?

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,960
What's wrong?

99
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,080
This uniform is too small.

100
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,660
It's the book manager's mistake.

101
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,560
Matoi, take it off.

102
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,540
I'll tell him to change it.

103
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,060
I'll tell him to change it.

104
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,380
But what are you going to do until it arrives?

105
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,940
It's fine.

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,800
With a T-shirt.

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,360
Eh?

108
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,900
Isn't a T-shirt bad?

109
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,680
That's right.

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,580
There's something good.

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,060
I think it was at the shopping street event.

112
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,900
Here we go.

113
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,380
What's this?

114
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
It's like a party for a pachinko shop!

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,140
It seems like it was sent to a new minister.

116
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,740
Huh?

117
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,220
Gita-kara-tama...

118
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,400
Eh?

119
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,120
What's this word?

120
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,760
Is it a four-letter idiom?

121
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,040
It seems like a name, but...

122
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,220
It's Giboshi Matoi.

123
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:27,860
Huh?

124
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,580
Ah!

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,180
You're the one from yesterday!

126
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,300
I'm Giboshi Matoi, who has been assigned to my office from today!

127
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,140
Ah, it's you.

128
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,780
I'm Reiko Akimoto, a postman at the park.

129
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,980
Nice to meet you.

130
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Nice to meet you.

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

132
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,460
Nice to meet you.

133
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,360
Nice to meet you.

134
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,240
And, did you see that gorilla over there somewhere?

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,620
You...

136
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,120
You're not here!

137
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,940
I've been asking you for a while now,

138
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,300
and you're asking me for a reason, even though you're a new member!

139
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,400
What do you think you're doing?

140
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,440
I'm just talking to you!

141
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,080
Shut up!

142
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,700
What's the big deal with that?

143
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,940
You're wearing a uniform, so you're wearing a uniform!

144
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,460
I don't have a uniform!

145
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,320
The size of the uniform I was assigned didn't fit.

146
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,460
Matoi, when you talk to him,

147
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,480
it makes you look like an idiot.

148
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,800
That's right!

149
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,420
He's the worst policeman in the past!

150
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,340
He's the number one man who's not married for the past 11 years!

151
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,820
You're lower than a cockroach!

152
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,960
You're trying to say whatever you want in a trance!

153
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,160
Senpai.

154
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:34,600
Huh?

155
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,960
Ah, Matoi-chan.

156
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,860
Ah, the old lady of Sakamoto!

157
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,340
Ah, the old lady of Sakamoto!

158
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,820
What's up?

159
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,480
What's wrong with the Kanda Myojin Shita Association?

160
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,540
Congratulations on your new job, Matoi!

161
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,980
Thank you! But I don't need to do this.

162
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,720
This is from my master.

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,600
Sorry.

164
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,460
Is your tooth getting better?

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,460
Yeah, thanks to you.

166
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,480
Anyway, Matoi, everyone is supporting you!

167
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,440
Good luck, Matoi!

168
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,520
Catch a lot of bad guys!

169
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,020
Thank you!

170
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,600
You're being loved, Matoi.

171
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,020
You're very popular.

172
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,940
You said you became a Kanda Myojin Shita.

173
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,460
Is he born in the same year as you?

174
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
He was born and raised in Kanda.

175
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,500
He's a nice boy.

176
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,540
I knew you were bad at talking.

177
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,800
Hmm, so you're Kanda.

178
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,180
Hey, Matoi!

179
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,820
You came here, too?

180
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,140
Today is Matoi's lucky day!

181
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,020
I'll give you a gift of celebration!

182
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Yeah.

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,500
To everyone?

184
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,380
I'll give you a gift of celebration!

185
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,860
Can I have a card, please?

186
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,120
Hey, Yomachi!

187
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Hey, Yomachi!

188
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,800
Hey, Yomachi!

189
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,540
Oh, my!

190
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,900
As expected of a famous soba restaurant in Kanda.

191
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,720
It looks delicious!

192
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,740
It's fresh from the market.

193
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,360
Oh, my!

194
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Oh, my!

195
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,860
It's delicious!

196
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,340
I've never had such delicious soba before.

197
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,900
It's 100% soba.

198
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,380
This restaurant has been here for a long time.

199
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,000
Wow!

200
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,660
As expected of a Shita town.

201
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:13,940
Please come again.

202
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,800
I live here for seven days a week.

203
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:17,960
So I can eat the best foods.

204
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,880
Oh, I see.

205
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,380
This is the fifth generation of that.

206
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, I see.

207
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,580
You are the 5th generation of the Asakusa.

208
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:23,920
Are you from Asakusa?

209
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,340
Ok.

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
That's not a good sign.

211
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,120
That's not a good sign.

212
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,880
You've looked down from the roof,

213
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,560
and you're always in the right place.

214
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,640
That's not what you think.

215
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
What do you mean?

216
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,920
Is that so, senpai?

217
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,880
Y-Yeah...

218
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,040
I ride it no matter how many times I try to be careful...

219
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,400
I was also able to put a triangle on the handle bar so that I won't get on it...

220
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,080
Hey, you must remember this!

221
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,520
Shut up!

222
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
It's a festival, so you should be excited!

223
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,620
Be excited!

224
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,360
I can't stand it when a man with such thoughts is in the city!

225
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,740
Don't say "I'm ticked off"!

226
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,260
Even though I used to live in a farm, I don't have the habit of living in a building right now!

227
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,860
Then, what about you, Mr. Atsushi?

228
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,380
Are you a "Samba Carnival"?

229
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,100
Why are you a Samba Carnival?!

230
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,820
Y-You're making a sharp comment.

231
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,820
It's okay!

232
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,340
I can dance in front of the camera while drinking while looking at myself naked!

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,060
You're a fool!

234
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,960
You're not being a ryo at all!

235
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,680
You're right.

236
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,980
It's more embarrassing to hear it.

237
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,540
You can do it, Matoi!

238
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
That's amazing that you don't even take a step back against Ryotsu!

239
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,900
His voice is so loud.

240
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,600
Good luck, Matoi!

241
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
Don't be so mean!

242
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,580
Shut up, Gaiya!

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,860
What?

244
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm losing, so don't get me into trouble!

245
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,940
That's right!

246
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,040
You always brag about your "tick-off" behavior, but you're more like a "tick-off" person!

247
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,680
That's right!

248
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,420
Matoi is also good at "Begoma"!

249
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
"Begoma"?

250
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,380
Well, I've never lost to a boy!

251
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,080
You're so stupid, Ghiboshi!

252
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,800
What?

253
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:09,980
What?

254
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,200
There is no human on Earth who can beat me, the king of "Begoma"!

255
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
Don't play with me and get involved!

256
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,500
What?

257
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
Let's have a good game!

258
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,280
You're going to regret it!

259
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,420
Look!

260
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm a "Begoma 2" who likes to carry things around!

261
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:30,880
What?

262
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,940
That's none of your business!

263
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,380
I always have it with me!

264
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,320
What?

265
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,420
Hey!

266
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,720
As expected of the town girl!

267
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,460
I'll make the topo, so wait for me!

268
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,880
Okay, it's done!

269
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,740
Asakusa man, it's a game!

270
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,880
We don't have Asakusa man, do we?

271
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,260
Call me Ryotsu-san or Ryotsu-senpai!

272
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,340
That's not a big deal, right?

273
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Hurry up and roll!

274
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,080
You were caught well, Giboshi.

275
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,440
I didn't know that this piece was King Kaizo's.

276
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,980
Okay, I'm ready!

277
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,140
Chi! Chi! Chi!

278
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,700
It's really slow!

279
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,840
I won this game!

280
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,480
I won!

281
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,520
I can't beat a man!

282
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,340
There's no doubt about that!

283
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,640
What's with that "beigoma"?

284
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,020
I'll take that!

285
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,800
Amazing!

286
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,640
Are you okay, senpai?

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,580
Ha ha ha!

288
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,620
Women can't be serious with others.

289
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,440
You didn't seem like that at all.

290
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,760
Yeah.

291
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,140
I said, "I'm serious!"

292
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,600
Damn it!

293
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,200
Next, it's a game with menko!

294
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,140
No problem!

295
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,900
But I don't have menko, so please lend me Asakusa's.

296
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,380
It's not Asakusa!

297
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,720
It's Ryotsu-Kankichi!

298
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,280
Here you go.

299
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I was convinced.

300
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,180
You

301
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,260
I'll put this menko in oil for a month,

302
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,980
so it's three times heavier.

303
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,620
Ouch!

304
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,940
It won't crack!

305
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm not going to be a victim!

306
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,960
My treat!

307
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,960
Eeeh!

308
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,900
I can't beat a man after all!

309
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,520
Hey, hurry up and do it!

310
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,100
Huh?

311
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,580
Here, take it.

312
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,940
You can do it first.

313
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,460
Then, without hesitation!

314
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,640
Yaaaaaay!

315
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,220
I did it!

316
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,040
Yay! We won again!

317
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,140
Ryouchi Kankichi has been boasting a lot so far!

318
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,780
He was really bad at it.

319
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,060
Shut up!

320
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,360
Yay! Gimoshi! Let's fight with the "begoma" again!

321
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you going to use the modified "begoma" again?

322
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,560
Meat!

323
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
There was one in my school.

324
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,260
A boy who used to use only cowardly hands.

325
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
He shaved the king's belly and modified it,

326
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,780
and he made the face fat-soaked and made it heavier.

327
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,040
Eeeh?

328
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,860
Ryo, is that true?

329
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,340
Y-Yeah, um...

330
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,400
You're a cheater, as I thought!

331
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,700
You pervert! You scum!

332
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,420
You!

333
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
I got hit in the head!

334
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm going to beat you up!

335
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,440
This has nothing to do with the seniors!

336
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,580
Eeeh!

337
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,380
Ryouchi Kankichi is being boasted about being a new member!

338
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Huh?

339
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,660
I'm going to do this!

340
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,760
The new member's name is Gimboshi Matoi.

341
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,240
Oh, Junsaka!

342
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,580
Is it true?

343
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,640
The senior lost because of "begoma" and "menko"?

344
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,680
Shut up!

345
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,720
But a new member has come.

346
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,360
Damn it!

347
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,380
Gimboshi Matoi, remember this!

348
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,360
A computer?

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes.

350
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,800
Oh, perfect!

351
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,520
I run a sushi restaurant in Kanda,

352
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,100
but I'm going to make a store's homepage next time.

353
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,580
That's the only thing I can do.

354
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,400
Do you know who is familiar with this?

355
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Well,

356
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,100
if it's an email or an internet,

357
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,240
I can do something about it,

358
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,440
but not to make a homepage.

359
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,020
If you're a gorilla man, you might be able to do it.

360
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,420
Gorilla man?

361
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,820
Oh, from Asakusa!

362
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,000
You know what it is pretty well with that face.

363
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,920
But I'm sure you'll get paid for it!

364
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Oh, really?

365
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,580
Not only you have a bad face and personality,

366
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,740
but you're also dirty about money!

367
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,560
For money, I'm a man who sells souls, you know?

368
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:03,780
He's a good man.

369
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,580
Then I'll go fishing with sushi.

370
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,120
What?

371
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,980
Oh.

372
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,800
Mr. Giboshi is very popular.

373
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,980
He's the second most popular person, after Reiko.

374
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,160
He's like an idol in the public transport industry.

375
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,280
Hey, shut up!

376
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,760
I said it's been three days, but you're still talking about it.

377
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,120
The police chief often uses such a way to get back.

378
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,840
What's the standard of the police chief's application?

379
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,880
Don't say that!

380
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,060
You're such a snob!

381
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,800
You're making me proud!

382
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,780
If we meet again...

383
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,480
What are you going to do, man from Asakusa?

384
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,180
Snob?

385
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,740
Hello.

386
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,000
Hello.

387
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,200
Hey, don't show up suddenly!

388
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,840
And stop calling me a man from Asakusa.

389
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,140
Don't call me that with the title of Enka.

390
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,200
You're so annoying!

391
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,360
Oh, you finally got your uniform.

392
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,660
Yes. I liked the flip side, too.

393
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,460
Well, it looks really good on you.

394
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,000
I wonder if that's true.

395
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,620
Are you here to brag about your uniform?

396
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,380
No.

397
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,480
I have a favor to ask of you.

398
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,220
A favor?

399
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,180
Hey, can you choose a computer?

400
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,140
And make a homepage, too.

401
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,780
Oh.

402
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,540
I'm busy.

403
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,600
I heard that Matoi-chan's house is a sushi restaurant.

404
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,300
Yes.

405
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,580
What sushi?

406
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,960
If you help me make a homepage,

407
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,500
I'll treat you to as much sushi as you want!

408
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,080
You can eat as much as you want!

409
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
You can eat as much as you want?

410
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
But you're the one who made me proud.

411
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,180
You're the pride of a man.

412
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,820
That's what I'm trying to say.

413
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,700
You want to take pride from a man,

414
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
or the much-eaten sushi!

415
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,380
Look, here is a great "Kanburi"

416
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,760
"Kanburi"!

417
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,220
That's all I need!

418
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,940
I'm done!

419
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,120
I guess I have no choice.

420
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
I'll help you, for my junior.

421
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,680
I can't believe it cost 50,000 yen for everything.

422
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm an Akihabara person.

423
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,620
If I work a little harder, I'll get 30,000 yen.

424
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,220
You're making the shopkeeper cry.

425
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,140
This is our shop.

426
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,640
Oh, it's here.

427
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
It's a very old shop.

428
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm back!

429
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,200
Welcome back.

430
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,260
Welcome back.

431
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,240
I bought a computer.

432
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,880
Hello. Good evening.

433
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,040
Who are you?

434
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,620
I'm your colleague, Asakusa.

435
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,620
Oh, Asakusa-san. Good work.

436
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,920
Hey, say your name properly.

437
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,360
Asakusa is a good place.

438
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,200
Oh, good.

439
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,660
There's quite a yard in the middle of the city.

440
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,940
Really?

441
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,640
So, where are you going to put your computer?

442
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,860
It's my grandma's room.

443
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Oh, it's a room that feels nostalgic.

444
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,320
I'll go and get some tea. Wait for me.

445
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,760
Yeah, I'll set it up.

446
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,800
As expected, there's only the old woman.

447
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,380
It's clean and tidy.

448
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,580
She must be a nice old woman.

449
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:36,940
I'm very impressed.

450
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,300
Hmm?

451
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,240
Huh?

452
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,860
These buttons are the same as my own.

453
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,600
Grandma!

454
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,700
Huh?

455
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh!

456
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,780
Huh?

457
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,540
What?

458
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,100
This is a mystery!

459
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,480
Huh?

460
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,240
Oh, no!

461
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,740
Grandma, he's not a thief!

462
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,560
He's a policeman!

463
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,820
What?

464
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:04,920
What?

465
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,780
What? Is that your colleague?

466
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,860
I thought I'd just make him mine.

467
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,080
What a scary old lady.

468
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,760
All right, setup complete.

469
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,700
Can you record the water level of the shop?

470
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,400
Of course!

471
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,120
The special software is installed.

472
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,180
It's installed?

473
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,800
Installed? Setup?

474
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,500
There are so many letters.

475
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,360
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,040
That's why you don't like computers.

477
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,900
It doesn't matter if I remember.

478
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's try to calculate the sales or something.

479
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,340
Really?

480
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,300
This is the water level of last month.

481
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,180
This is this one.

482
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

483
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,340
Wow.

484
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,800
Amazing.

485
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,260
That's great.

486
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,280
How is it? Easy, right?

487
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,120
Wait a minute.

488
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:07,720
Huh?

489
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,720
I'll check if it's correct.

490
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,520
What?

491
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,280
The water level of the water tank.

492
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,960
Wow, it's amazing.

493
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,800
It's a five-ball.

494
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,640
It's old.

495
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,040
What?

496
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,480
Hmm?

497
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,340
Huh?

498
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,240
Hmm?

499
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,080
It's correct.

500
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,760
What?

501
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,540
What was that?

502
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,420
I didn't see my finger at all.

503
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,040
You're pretty good at computers.

504
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,920
A machine.

505
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,800
Mr. Asakusa,

506
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,620
could you record the data of the shop up until now?

507
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,740
All right.

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,420
I'll record everything.

509
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,140
All right.

510
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,700
What?

511
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,000
Huh?

512
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,500
Can I start from the 17th year of Kyohoku?

513
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,980
I think it's OK to start from the time.

514
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
Wait, wait, wait.

515
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,340
How many years ago do you intend to enter?

516
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,620
About 300 years ago.

517
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,280
Don't joke like that!

518
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,200
If you put such a huge data,

519
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,800
you wouldn't have known how many days or weeks it would take.

520
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,540
It can't be helped.

521
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,300
It's OK if I start here from the year I arrived here.

522
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,740
Then, this guy.

523
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,920
I'll ask you from now on, Mr. Asakusa.

524
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,740
I'm not Mr. Asakusa.

525
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,700
I'm 12 years old.

526
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
How old is this old lady?

527
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,580
99 years old.

528
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,900
Oh, she's almost 100 years old.

529
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,500
Yeah.

530
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,840
100 years old?

531
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,280
Why is she older than my old man?

532
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,340
This is your grandmother's handwriting.

533
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,200
Did you leave the store's record to her when you arrived?

534
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,240
My father in law liked it.

535
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
That year, the fish was poor.

536
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,720
So,

537
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,960
I went to buy it by bicycle with a single yen bill.

538
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,460
The bonito was 5,000 yen and the sea bream was 10,000 yen.

539
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,240
And then, in the second year,

540
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,620
it was finally 15,000 yen and 23,000 yen in black.

541
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,180
I was relieved.

542
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,880
Hey,

543
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,420
you don't need a computer in this house, do you?

544
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,940
Your grandmother is very good at memorizing and she's fast at solving problems.

545
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,500
Don't be silly.

546
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
After work, I'll treat you to our super special sushi.

547
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,460
Oh, that's right.

548
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,820
Super special sushi.

549
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,600
I'll put it in from the 12th year.

550
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,280
I'll put it in from the 12th year.

551
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,360
I'll put it in from the 12th year.

552
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,440
I'll put it in from the 12th year.

553
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,180
I'll put it in from the 12th year.

554
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,240
I've finished writing the entry form and the website for the 88-year water tower.

555
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,080
Good job, Asakusa.

556
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,920
I told you it's not.

557
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,340
I don't have the energy to deny it.

558
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,940
I don't have the energy to deny it.

559
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,340
Well, I'll prepare the sushi you promised.

560
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,640
Well, I'll prepare the sushi you promised.

561
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,760
Oh, thank you.

562
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,340
I have something to ask you about the website.

563
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,260
I have something to ask you about the website.

564
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,920
What is it?

565
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,380
When accessing the website,

566
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,280
data is cached to the proxy server, right?

567
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,500
Domain name system server,

568
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,060
and the secondary and primary are also cached?

569
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,340
What an old woman.

570
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,300
Do you already understand that?

571
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,020
What?

572
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,500
What's wrong?

573
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,640
I don't need to learn such a difficult system.

574
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,140
I just need to press the internet.

575
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,460
I can do it in one go.

576
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,160
I see.

577
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,520
Thank you for waiting, Asakusa.

578
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,880
Thank you for waiting, Asakusa.

579
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,240
This is the super special sushi.

580
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,160
I'll enjoy it.

581
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,040
Thank you.

582
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,840
What are you doing?

583
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:42,640
Well,

584
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,400
I asked this person to do a job worth 1 million yen.

585
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,760
Isn't this rude?

586
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,660
I'll give you 1 million yen worth of Otaro sushi.

587
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,660
I'll give you 1 million yen worth of Otaro sushi.

588
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,260
I understand.

589
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,620
And you have a good sense of humor, right?

590
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes, I do.

591
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,620
I thought you were a ridiculous old woman.

592
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,900
But you are a great old woman.

593
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,720
You have a good salary.

594
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,940
Have some.

595
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,980
Anything?

596
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,560
What?

597
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,080
Do you want some?

598
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,020
No, I'm asking for some.

599
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,800
I'm asking for some.

600
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm asking for some.

601
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,020
I'm asking for some.

602
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,220
What's wrong, Asakusa?

603
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,080
You love sushi, don't you?

604
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,840
I only use the best quality sushi.

605
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm sure you can get 2 million yen for 3 pieces.

606
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,360
Damn it.

607
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,960
I should have gotten a normal sushi.

608
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm a ridiculous old woman.

609
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm going to burn you.

610
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,820
It's a good meal.

611
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,380
I like it.

612
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,220
I like it.

613
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,720
I like it.

614
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,820
I'm here.

615
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:57,860
It's painful.

616
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,520
It's been a long time, and I haven't seen such a happy old woman.

617
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,220
Asakusa, thank you so much for today.

618
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,140
I got 2 million yen worth of sushi.

619
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,100
It's not an honor.

620
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,920
You should give me an applause at times like this.

621
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,520
Yeah.

622
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,660
I had fun too.

623
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,540
Oh, really?

624
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,640
Well, good night.

625
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,700
Oh!

626
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,260
Wow!

627
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,160
Ryo-chan made this?

628
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,280
No, it's all from the music to the CD.

629
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,120
It's all made by Ghiboshi's grandma.

630
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,680
But, you were a beginner at computer.

631
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
What a great grandma.

632
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
I made sure to receive the business card by mail.

633
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,200
Is this person the manager's name?

634
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,120
This is called Ghiboshi Gepard.

635
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,680
Gepard?

636
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
My father's name is Ghiboshi Yoroshiku.

637
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
My sister's name is Ghiboshi Lemon.

638
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,160
My brother's name is Ghiboshi Yuzu.

639
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,020
It's almost the same.

640
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,660
It's half the world.

641
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,800
What?

642
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,640
What?

643
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,060
You can't kick me if you're a loser.

644
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,440
What?

645
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,680
What did you say?

646
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,300
Give me back my car.

647
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,600
What?

648
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,680
What's wrong?

649
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,360
She's angry because I moved the car by myself.

650
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,720
That place is not allowed to park.

651
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,100
The resident's complaint was already out.

652
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,060
I can't talk to a little girl like you.

653
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,320
Call the boss.

654
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,420
Call the boss.

655
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,640
What?

656
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Hey!

657
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,780
Stop, Ghiboshi!

658
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,260
You're not going out.

659
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,560
Hey, Ryo stopped the fight.

660
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,140
Ryo is the one who started the fight.

661
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,640
Give me back my car!

662
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,640
Hey!

663
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,500
What are you doing?

664
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,720
Shut up!

665
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,800
Ghiboshi!

666
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,980
You're going to get a girl!

667
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,540
Don't hurt a girl's face!

668
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,500
Asakusa!

669
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,940
Your face is so...

670
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,580
I'll make you a girl!

671
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,080
Please stop!

672
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,880
What?

673
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,180
What?

674
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,580
What?

675
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,000
What?

676
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,280
This is what happened.

677
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,660
It's because of Ryo.

678
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,680
"Machinima"

679
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,140
"Machinima"

680
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,380
"Machinima"

681
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,280
Hello.

682
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,800
Excuse me.

683
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,260
How did it go?

684
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,460
I was able to escape the neck.

685
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,260
But, I was supposed to be in quarantine for a month.

686
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,020
Like always.

687
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,360
When you're injured, you were fine, weren't you?

688
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,360
It's nothing serious.

689
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,020
You did all this for me.

690
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,100
You were managed by one.

691
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,000
Now, don't worry about it.

692
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
I'm the home run king of not going to go to the bathroom.

693
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,820
Am I laughing?

694
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,380
Ryo.

695
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm going back to the only.

696
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,300
However, you are not going to use "Ryo".

697
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm working overtime.

698
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,320
Yes.

699
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,160
Thank you for your help every time.

700
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,280
Well,

701
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I don't have any pay during overtime,

702
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,460
so I have to find a part-time job.

703
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,240
Then I'll take care of you at home.

704
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:19,940
What?

705
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,540
At Cho Kanda Sushi?

706
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,720
I was just looking for a part-time job.

707
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,320
How about 300,000 yen for a month of living?

708
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,220
What?

709
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,800
Can I get that much?

710
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,360
Thank you.

711
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,080
That's right.

712
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,380
Grandma wanted to see you.

713
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,100
Huh?

714
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,960
I completely forgot that she was there.

715
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,560
Asakusa,

716
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,300
I'm grateful to you for giving me a job.

717
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,440
Oh, that's good.

718
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,400
By the way,

719
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,940
I'm raising a post-pet Momo.

720
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,400
She won't come home after taking a walk.

721
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,420
I'm working overtime at a sushi restaurant.

722
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,540
You can do that later. Come on!

723
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,180
Huh?

724
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,360
Hey, wait!

725
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,620
By the way, what's her name?

726
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,080
What's her name?

727
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,220
Hmm, I don't remember her real name.

728
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,800
For now, this is fine.

729
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,440
Huh?

730
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,640
Ichiro Asakusa?

731
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,880
Is this really okay?

732
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,720
There's a bigger room.

733
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
Yeah, it's better to stay in a small room.

734
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,180
Well, I'll bring a futon later.

735
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,200
Yeah.

736
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,440
Take a bath while you're at it.

737
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,000
You'll be busy at 6:00.

738
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,220
I'll be busy at 8:00.

739
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Roger that.

740
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,360
Oh, it's like a hot spring.

741
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
It's amazing to have a private house.

742
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,360
After living like this,

743
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,720
I can get paid.

744
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,940
I wonder if I'll really get a job.

745
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,900
Ha ha ha ha.

746
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
Ichiro, I'll give you two cups of hot springs.

747
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,520
Yes!

748
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,500
Ichiro, a banquet at Fugusashi.

749
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,680
Yes, yes!

750
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,280
Ichiro, a beer with Okunotatsuki.

751
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:56,860
Yes!

752
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,660
Ichiro, 50 cups of rice balls.

753
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,140
Yes!

754
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
Ichiro, 100 cups of tea.

755
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,060
Yes!

756
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,780
Ichiro!

757
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,760
Yes!

758
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,840
Since when did I become Ichiro?

759
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,300
Ichiro!

760
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,320
Yes!

761
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,420
You're such a gross.

762
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,560
You're telling me your name.

763
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,640
Ichiro!

764
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,200
Yes!

765
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,360
Ichiro, Ichiro!

766
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,680
Ichiro!

767
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,120
Ichiro!

768
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,380
Ichiro!

769
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,760
Please wait!

770
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,660
Oh, it's finally over.

771
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,340
This is a cheap 10,000 yen per day.

772
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,860
Good work.

773
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,760
If there's a banquet, you can tell me first.

774
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,920
What are you talking about?

775
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,760
Every day this week, there's a banquet.

776
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:29,920
I'm in the first floor.

777
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,260
What?

778
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,620
Oh, it's already midnight.

779
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,040
I'm hungry.

780
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Here.

781
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,060
Huh?

782
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,880
It's a night meal leaflet.

783
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,780
I made it.

784
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

785
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
Hohoho!

786
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,660
Toro, uni, abalone!

787
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,580
Goka, kenda!

788
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,540
It's a feast at night.

789
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,220
I'm glad I came to the sushi shop for a part-time job.

790
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,620
Let's eat!

791
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,560
It's delicious.

792
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,240
Um.

793
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,720
It's sweet!

794
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,000
Getting sleepy.

795
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,520
Good morning, Asakusa.

796
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,140
Did you sleep well?

797
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm not sleepy.

798
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,060
I was beaten up by grandma before dawn.

799
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,780
It's a full rotation.

800
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,680
You'll get used to it in a couple of days.

801
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,820
Then, I'm going to work.

802
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,320
Yes.

803
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,140
Nice to meet you all.

804
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,160
Miss, take care.

805
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,040
Hey Ichiro, come and feed me.

806
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:32,880
Yes.

807
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,240
Huh, this is a high voice again.

808
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,320
Ha ha ha.

809
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,200
Good, good.

810
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,460
How is it? Are you a little used to it?

811
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,340
I didn't think the customer business was so hard.

812
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,720
By the way, that frame looks pretty old.

813
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,860
Yeah, it's from the Meiji era.

814
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,500
Can I look inside a little?

815
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,020
I wonder if it's okay to look inside.

816
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,700
It seems like there are treasures.

817
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,860
It's just a warehouse.

818
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,860
Huh? That scroll is from Tessai Tomioka.

819
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,420
No, everyone else is famous artists.

820
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,980
It's a mountain of treasures, seriously.

821
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,700
Can I go inside for a moment?

822
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,500
That's the Akazu-no-ma.

823
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,220
What?

824
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,000
It's made of sturdy jomai.

825
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,420
I've never been inside one.

826
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,040
Yeah, he's an amateur.

827
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,720
My acquaintance has a jomai shop, so let's let him open it.

828
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,260
Huh? But I have to ask the old lady.

829
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
You're going to open the chest?

830
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,060
If you ask the jomai shop of your acquaintance, you can open it in two or three days.

831
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,300
I wanted to organize the inside.

832
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,800
It was just right.

833
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,920
Please do it.

834
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,260
Yes, there is a request there.

835
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,280
A request?

836
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,540
I'd like to have a roll.

837
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,320
Do you really want it?

838
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,360
It's a lifelong request.

839
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,100
If you work hard, I can give it to you.

840
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,000
Thank you very much.

841
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,020
I'll work hard.

842
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,600
Welcome.

843
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,500
Two people will come in.

844
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,840
Good morning.

845
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,720
Come on, come on.

846
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,600
Ichiro is very enthusiastic.

847
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,540
Sushi is not that good.

848
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,400
I have to be good at cooking.

849
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,520
Huh?

850
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,220
Did Ichiro sharpen this knife?

851
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,180
That's right.

852
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,120
I don't think it's part-time.

853
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,340
It's the main dish.

854
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,320
He has a good sense of direction.

855
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,880
As expected of the man in the lower town.

856
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,700
Hello.

857
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
Thank you very much.

858
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,500
Ichiro, please wash the dishes.

859
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,280
Yes.

860
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
The owner of the inn is also ...

861
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,540
If it's real, I'll give you 5 million yen.

862
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:48,800
I'll forget it.

863
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,760
Is it true?

864
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,280
I haven't noticed it yet.

865
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,140
It's a wonderful day off.

866
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,400
It's interesting because this is the world.

867
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,080
You really work well.

868
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,760
He's good at making dishes, and he's a good craftsman.

869
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,920
What?

870
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,780
What?

871
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,580
He's the son of Matoi.

872
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,040
Marry!

873
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,920
Wait a minute.

874
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,140
Matoi is still 19 years old.

875
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,800
Women are in their teens.

876
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,300
Matoi is clearly dressed.

877
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:18,980
It's a girl who is in her teens.

878
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,380
It's perfect for a man like you.

879
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,300
But ...

880
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,900
I don't like him.

881
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,020
Matoi has been married to someone who has been in my eyes for a long time.

882
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,820
But ...

883
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,540
What?

884
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,740
Do you say you don't like Matoi?

885
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,500
No.

886
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,880
I think she's a good girl.

887
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,680
Then the story is too early.

888
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,860
From tomorrow, I will make you a good craftsman.

889
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,240
What?

890
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,280
If you pass, you will be a good craftsman.

891
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,660
See you!

892
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,660
I never expected this to happen.

893
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,960
This land is a great fortune.

894
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,220
I will be safe for the rest of my life.

895
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,120
But you are more concerned about your wealth than your wife.

896
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,840
What the hell am I?

897
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,420
Akegarasu ...

898
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,220
What? You know that song?

899
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,040
I learned it too.

900
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,940
I didn't think that my relative, the old woman of Yanagibashi,

901
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,420
was playing it.

902
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,100
You learned it from your old woman.

903
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,260
You like it, don't you?

904
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,740
I don't think it's in the center of Tokyo.

905
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,080
It's quiet at night.

906
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,140
There are many people and cars around here during the day.

907
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,480
But there are only empty buildings at night.

908
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,820
That's unexpected.

909
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,220
Come to my room.

910
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,060
What?

911
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,680
It's getting cold.

912
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,680
It's a room with nothing.

913
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,020
I don't like to put things in it.

914
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,040
You want to drink, right?

915
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,760
Oh, sure.

916
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,800
Wait a minute.

917
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,920
At this time of night,

918
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,260
you might be interested in me

919
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,180
Here you are.

920
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,760
I can't answer.

921
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,220
All right.

922
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,220
You drink too.

923
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,860
I can't.

924
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm still a young man.

925
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,420
My grandmother stopped me.

926
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,000
In the Yuboshike family,

927
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,580
you must obey the orders of the old woman of Yanagibashi.

928
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Of course.

929
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,340
The old woman is the most important.

930
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:46,980
Rather,

931
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
you look completely different than when you first met me.

932
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,360
What?

933
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,280
I misunderstood you so far.

934
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,060
You are a good person.

935
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,720
Did you understand now?

936
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,280
It's too late to notice.

937
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,540
When I see you,

938
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,080
I feel like someone else.

939
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,360
What?

940
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,620
No.

941
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,740
Is this a confession?

942
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,180
Is it a proposal for the Yuboshike?

943
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,300
It's already empty.

944
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,580
Actually,

945
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,280
I feel like someone else.

946
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,200
Actually,

947
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,640
there is no one.

948
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,500
All right.

949
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,440
I understand.

950
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,160
I understand.

951
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,680
As you say,

952
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,160
I have a cash.

953
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,420
Do not lose your way

954
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,680
in the treasure.

955
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,240
What?

956
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,160
You are not a Yuboshike.

957
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,660
Are you here already?

958
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,740
Yes.

959
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,800
The treasure is empty.

960
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,000
Hurry up.

961
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,060
Hey, old woman.

962
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,400
What about the scrolls?

963
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,480
Don't worry.

964
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,280
I have prepared them.

965
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,580
Don't surprise me.

966
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,600
All right.

967
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,640
Here.

968
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,220
The scrolls.

969
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,400
Now,

970
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,920
you are in charge.

971
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,780
It's not a scroll of sushi.

972
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,460
It's a scroll in the treasure.

973
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,620
It's not?

974
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,380
I have burned most of the scrolls in the treasure.

975
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:20,280
You are a beauty, old woman.

976
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,940
Hello.

977
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,900
What is this?

978
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,080
I made you a high-quality scroll.

979
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,900
Wow.

980
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,380
This is my first time to eat the scrolls.

981
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
By the way,

982
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,500
do you know where the scroll is?

983
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,060
for three weeks

984
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,280
when I came to the shop.

985
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,300
Well,

986
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,160
you eat it and see.

987
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,080
Well,

988
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,520
you ate it and see.

989
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,080
the string after it was tied up a lot.

990
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,840
The scroll of the scroll

991
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,040
have good shape.

992
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,840
It was printed thoroughly.

993
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,880
My good grandma did it the best.

994
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,060
Brings back

995
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,260
And he drinks fast too.

996
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,020
He's also very active.

997
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,320
He's gonna be a great craftsman.

998
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,700
What?

999
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,220
He wants to own a restaurant?

1000
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm more of a customer salesman.

1001
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,720
Like a super Kanda sushi chef.

1002
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,880
He's been training for 10 years to own a restaurant.

1003
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,380
You've only been here for 3 weeks.

1004
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,460
Interesting!

1005
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
I'll let you own a restaurant.

1006
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,100
What?

1007
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,360
Grandma!

1008
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,620
Grandma!

1009
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,200
Our store is opening next month.

1010
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,840
You can use the store for a week until the opening.

1011
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
It's like a demonstration.

1012
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,540
I see.

1013
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,880
I'll deliver the content.

1014
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,180
No, no.

1015
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,700
I won't take care of the store.

1016
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,320
I want to do it by myself.

1017
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,640
Is Asakusa okay?

1018
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,940
Leave it to me.

1019
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,000
What?

1020
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,600
Ryo-chan is opening a restaurant?

1021
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,500
He's the owner of our branch store, No. 1.

1022
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,180
Is that okay?

1023
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,000
He's on a break.

1024
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,000
Kouki's...

1025
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,080
What was his name?

1026
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,960
Mr. Honda?

1027
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,220
Oh, right.

1028
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,980
He said he'd help him.

1029
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,180
Mr. Honda is being swayed by Ryo-chan again.

1030
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,780
Welcome!

1031
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,080
Three bowls of raw rice noodles.

1032
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,160
Two bowls of chirashi.

1033
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,880
Please wait a moment.

1034
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,580
Sea urchin and salmon roe.

1035
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:32,980
Okay.

1036
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,580
Honda!

1037
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,020
We haven't started yet.

1038
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,460
Okay.

1039
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,640
Please take this off.

1040
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,160
Excuse me.

1041
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:42,900
Ouch!

1042
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,480
You're such a pain in the ass.

1043
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,000
How many years have you been doing this?

1044
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,820
It's only been a day since I started this job.

1045
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
There's not enough people at the branch store today.

1046
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,920
We'll wait for you.

1047
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

1048
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Leave the rest to me.

1049
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,180
What? Me?

1050
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
Kouki and Kouki.

1051
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,320
Okay.

1052
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,240
Sayori.

1053
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,440
I wonder who's Kouki and Kouki.

1054
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,340
I might get scolded if I make a mistake.

1055
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,580
I'm a little worried.

1056
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,820
How about octopus?

1057
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,480
It's fine.

1058
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,680
I know what octopus is.

1059
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,840
Idiot!

1060
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,580
Idiot!

1061
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,280
Don't use the sashimi knife!

1062
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,440
Octopus is a wild animal.

1063
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,360
It's a wild animal.

1064
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,100
Put it on the wheel.

1065
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,660
Okay.

1066
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,200
Please wait a moment.

1067
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,100
You're good, but I don't feel like washing my hands.

1068
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,400
It'll be clean as soon as you hold a few.

1069
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,040
Don't worry.

1070
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,120
I'm sorry.

1071
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,560
Oh, it's a cheetah.

1072
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,620
Perfect.

1073
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,680
Yeah.

1074
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,020
I've got a water-toothed knife.

1075
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,040
A water-toothed knife.

1076
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,400
The first day sales are 2 million.

1077
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,780
What?

1078
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,460
What?

1079
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:39,740
No way.

1080
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,660
Yes, yes, don't push.

1081
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,520
One person only.

1082
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,040
That's strange.

1083
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,360
Sir, I'm calling from Major MacDowell.

1084
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,020
It's abalone, sea urchin, red sea urchin, sea urchin, and shrimp.

1085
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,060
It's okay if it's Russian.

1086
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,380
Hurry up.

1087
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,940
Take it with a military plane.

1088
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,280
Use the food and money.

1089
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,480
Where are you from?

1090
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,020
I'm from Aori.

1091
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,340
I'm from Aori.

1092
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,260
My own route.

1093
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,660
I'm from Aori.

1094
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,040
We're selling all sorts of seafood, and the store is big.

1095
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,500
Hahaha.

1096
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,440
What?

1097
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,400
I changed the entry and can't come over here?

1098
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,900
My own route has shut down.

1099
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,440
What should I do?

1100
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm inviting the Chiefs of O-Hara today, right?

1101
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,760
Go buy the material in the supermarket.

1102
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,300
You're coming.

1103
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Hurry up, from behind.

1104
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,660
Go.

1105
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,860
Hello.

1106
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,580
It's a nice store.

1107
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,300
Yeah.

1108
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,140
Well, I'm glad you came.

1109
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,620
He came to see me.

1110
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,520
Ryo-tsu, you look fine.

1111
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,840
Why is this bag here?

1112
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,440
It's a secret.

1113
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,240
Then, Ryo-tsu, I'll take the big one.

1114
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,220
Me too.

1115
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,740
Me too.

1116
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,080
Yes, yes, the big one.

1117
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,800
The freshly caught big one has just been imported.

1118
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,000
Here you are.

1119
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,240
Is this the big one?

1120
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,200
It looks like a normal red one.

1121
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,780
It looks like a normal red one.

1122
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,640
This is why amateurs are troubled.

1123
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,420
The original big one is here, the bottom part of the tuna.

1124
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,580
This is the special big one, which is called the red diamond.

1125
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,040
Is that so?

1126
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,360
It seems so.

1127
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,780
Then, senpai, the crab.

1128
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,920
The crab.

1129
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,320
What is this?

1130
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,040
It's a crab.

1131
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,480
This is a kamaboko with crab wings.

1132
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,240
It was cheap.

1133
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,340
What are you talking about?

1134
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,820
No, nothing.

1135
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,180
Wait.

1136
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,340
Isn't this a crab kamaboko?

1137
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,360
It's the other way around.

1138
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,180
It's a kamaboko-like crab that hardens the crab meat and makes it into a kamaboko.

1139
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,320
Is that so?

1140
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,560
Then, I'll take the scallop.

1141
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,380
Sure.

1142
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,080
It's the only one I have.

1143
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,840
And give me the squid.

1144
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,020
Here's the scallop.

1145
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,360
Is this scallop raw?

1146
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,120
Of course.

1147
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,160
It was moving a while ago.

1148
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,420
The taste is different, isn't it?

1149
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,600
It's definitely different.

1150
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,280
This squid isn't a salmon, is it?

1151
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,760
That's the high class. That's the common.

1152
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,600
It seems to be doing well.

1153
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,460
Gepard, why are you here in Ghiboshima?

1154
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,380
I came to see how it's going.

1155
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,340
What's your recommendation for today?

1156
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,000
Well, I've got kappa-maki and oinari-san.

1157
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,180
You can't do that, senpai.

1158
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,320
I've bought all of them at the supermarket.

1159
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,000
You idiot.

1160
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,140
What do you mean?

1161
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,640
No, no, no.

1162
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,300
It's not that.

1163
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,700
There's a reason for this.

1164
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,740
Here it comes.

1165
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,100
Huh?

1166
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,880
Whoa!

1167
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,360
I've been waiting!

1168
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,000
What?

1169
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,440
What's going on?

1170
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,480
Ryo-tsu!

1171
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1172
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,680
It's the bug dragon.

1173
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,180
I've purchased a lot of new ones from the Middle East Route.

1174
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,660
Thank you.

1175
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,780
You saved me.

1176
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,080
I'm so happy.

1177
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,740
You're laughter, right?

1178
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:09,800
I love you, Ryo-tsu.

1179
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,080
Ah, with a stick.

1180
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,940
I didn't know there was a stick here.

1181
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,560
Mom, Hime-kiji, Ryo-tsu feels a little like a movie star.

1182
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:15,620
OK, well, I'll be looking forward to it.

1183
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,200
Let me stay here.

1184
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,280
I don't know if you know this but I'm seeing a woman who loves you.

1185
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:18,540
Really?

1186
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes.

1187
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,080
I don't care.

1188
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,260
I love you.

1189
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,320
She is so kind.

1190
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,040
I love you.

1191
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,100
It's all you.

1192
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,380
It's a waste!

1193
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,480
Why would you marry her?

1194
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,880
Because I like her.

1195
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,120
You're really getting married?

1196
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,400
Yeah.

1197
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,600
They came to my place to ask for a na-code.

1198
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,040
I'm greeting the director right now.

1199
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,100
That's a great development.

1200
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,640
Oh, there they are!

1201
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,840
Ryo, Wato, congratulations!

1202
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,000
Congratulations!

1203
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,900
I-I feel like I've got a sudden shock.

1204
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,380
Huh?

1205
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,900
G-Gevalt!

1206
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,500
Ichiro, Matoi, follow me!

1207
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,460
Yes!

1208
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,520
I'm going to borrow the two of you.

1209
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,340
Oh...

1210
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,320
I panicked because I was getting married.

1211
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,280
Of course.

1212
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,280
There are things called order in the world.

1213
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,960
I haven't greeted your parents yet.

1214
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,120
I see.

1215
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,840
You're going to greet my parents?

1216
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm going to go now.

1217
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,560
Hey, that's sudden.

1218
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,500
They're going to panic too.

1219
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:22,780
I'm going to be a troublemaker.

1220
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,020
What?

1221
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,940
Are you serious, Kankichi?

1222
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,880
You're in trouble, old man!

1223
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,700
Kankichi is going to bring his wife.

1224
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,400
His wife?

1225
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:36,620
Huh?

1226
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,580
I'm going first.

1227
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,400
Oh, it's Tsukudaniya's old store.

1228
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,120
Tsukudaniya...

1229
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,180
What's wrong?

1230
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,440
Nothing.

1231
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,900
Oh, hey, congratulations!

1232
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,080
You're getting married?

1233
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,900
Why are you here, old man?

1234
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,400
I'm in trouble, old man!

1235
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:53,720
You're in trouble, you're in trouble!

1236
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,620
Pull him out!

1237
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,300
That's terrible.

1238
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,040
Hello.

1239
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,580
Good evening.

1240
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,500
Well, have a seat.

1241
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,760
It's a dirty place.

1242
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,940
Sorry for the trouble.

1243
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,540
What a beautiful lady.

1244
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,420
Yeah.

1245
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,840
They're my old couple.

1246
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm Ginji.

1247
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,700
I'm Yone.

1248
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,280
Thank you for this trip.

1249
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Thank you very much.

1250
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,280
Nice to meet you.

1251
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,800
My name's Matoi Giboshi.

1252
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,520
I hope you'll accept Shugen.

1253
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,820
I don't care anymore.

1254
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,360
I'll cook and cook and cook.

1255
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,280
I'll enjoy my life.

1256
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,740
What a nice house.

1257
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,700
It reminds me of my old house.

1258
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:32,900
Yeah.

1259
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,780
It's a dirty house.

1260
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,240
Where are you from, Mr. Giboshi?

1261
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,620
I'm a sushi seller in Kanda.

1262
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,300
Oh, I see.

1263
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,600
Sushi seller in Kanda?

1264
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,760
My grandchild is a policeman.

1265
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,460
Oh.

1266
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,580
That's...

1267
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,620
. . . ?

1268
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:49,860
You remember?

1269
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,180
Hey, don't come out!

1270
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,320
Huh?

1271
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,300
Why is this guy here?

1272
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,640
Huh?

1273
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,560
You know him?

1274
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,040
He's my grandfather.

1275
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,620
You're Ichiro Asakusa, aren't you?

1276
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,120
That's the name Giboshi gave me.

1277
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,180
I'm Ryo Tsukankichi.

1278
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,520
It was an unrecognizable name.

1279
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,320
We used to call him that.

1280
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,520
Why didn't you say that earlier?

1281
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,540
Everyone calls me Ichiro Ichiro, so I'm Yuhima.

1282
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,720
Ryo was the name before I came here.

1283
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,720
So why did you call me Ichiro Ichiro?

1284
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,420
You're a big deal to me.

1285
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:28,760
It was Yuhima.

1286
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,920
When did I know you before?

1287
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,980
When I met your mother.

1288
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,840
You thought that one day there was going to be an incident, like this?

1289
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,200
But I didn't know the situation.

1290
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,240
What happened?

1291
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,400
Defense, defense.

1292
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,840
Defends himself.

1293
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,300
How?

1294
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,940
Yes, this man is my brother.

1295
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,500
Before I became a super-kanda-sushi, I used to run a tsukudaniya at home.

1296
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,820
The business was good, and I started to make my own store.

1297
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,320
Then, my siblings left it to me.

1298
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,140
But, I worked hard every day to raise the store's sales,

1299
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,080
but I was just playing with the Kanbei people every day.

1300
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,980
You are so stupid.

1301
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,780
You are always making a mess.

1302
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,280
What's wrong with you?

1303
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,260
You are not making a mess, so I run the store.

1304
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,940
So, if I go to the store, the store will be broken in 10 days.

1305
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,580
Wait a minute.

1306
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,320
To summarize, Kanbei and Gepal are siblings.

1307
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,360
They are the children of the children.

1308
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,700
So, Matoi and I are twins.

1309
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,560
No way!

1310
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,780
Why didn't you notice me when we were close to Kanda and Asakusa?

1311
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,060
There was a fire.

1312
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,380
We have met more than 80 years.

1313
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,040
It's been 80 years since we met.

1314
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,480
We didn't know each other at all.

1315
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,160
We are the parents of you.

1316
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,300
I thought you were strangers from the first time I saw you on the street.

1317
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,260
We are close friends.

1318
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,840
If I knew your name was Ryotsu, I wouldn't have let you go.

1319
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:58,840
What?

1320
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,160
The women of the Ryotsu family are German and Swiss, and they are noble.

1321
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,400
But, the men of the Ryotsu family are Latin, and they are all good-for-nothing.

1322
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,860
Good-for-nothing.

1323
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,620
Good-for-nothing.

1324
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:20,160
If Gipo family has a good-for-nothing child, it will be the end of their lives.

1325
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,560
What about getting married with another man?

1326
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,940
We are relatives!

1327
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,340
What do you care?

1328
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,240
What matters is the feelings between us.

1329
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,200
Matoi, I'll tell you.

1330
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,000
Kanbei.

1331
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,580
Leo, let go!

1332
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,200
I'm going home!

1333
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,800
Hey, wait!

1334
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,360
Matoi!

1335
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,540
Matoi! I'm not giving up!

1336
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,560
K-Kankichi...

1337
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,320
Poor thing...

1338
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,020
K-Kankichi...

1339
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,800
Kanbei, say something!

1340
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,820
Let's go to the radio station.

1341
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,820
That's why your sister hates you!

1342
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,400
Grandma, I've never been against you saying things like that.

1343
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,880
But...

1344
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,060
But this time...

1345
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,860
I did it on my own will.

1346
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,200
I want to decide.

1347
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,280
Do as you please.

1348
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,080
Grandma...

1349
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,080
I...

1350
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,440
Miss!

1351
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,140
The door to the village is open!

1352
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,800
What did you say?

1353
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,720
I heard a strange sound from inside.

1354
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,440
So you came after all.

1355
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,340
I didn't know there was such a treasure underground.

1356
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,680
I'm surprised when I discovered this secret underground.

1357
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,980
This is the real satchel!

1358
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,100
Aren't you?

1359
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:14,640
Right?

1360
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:14,840
That's right.

1361
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,960
We are close since long.

1362
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,640
I have been married for six years.

1363
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,740
I wouldn't feel the need to live here anymore.

1364
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,100
No, I don't want!

1365
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,220
I don't want!

1366
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,280
You.

1367
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,240
Have you taken it?

1368
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,820
Bingo!

1369
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,460
What a waste of time!

1370
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,280
Now you understand, don't you?

1371
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,540
This is the real Ryouzuke!

1372
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,200
No, no, no, Matoi!

1373
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:42,900
I don't have any feelings!

1374
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,560
But first, I have a treasure...

1375
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,880
No, no, let's talk about it.

1376
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,820
If we talk about it, I'm sure...

1377
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,160
Goodbye!

1378
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,720
Hey, open the door!

1379
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,660
It's a misunderstanding!

1380
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,400
Please!

1381
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,100
Open the door!

1382
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,160
This time, you didn't see me.

1383
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,100
I'm sorry.

1384
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,380
I didn't see you.

1385
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,040
No, no.

1386
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,260
I've learned a lesson.

1387
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,100
I won't date a man from Latin America ever again.

1388
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,040
No, no.

1389
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,780
You should have someone who suits you more than that man.

1390
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,420
Will I be found?

1391
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,040
You won't be found.

1392
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,060
Because you are my grandson.

1393
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,480
That's right.

1394
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,520
All right, I'll do my best!

1395
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,960
Matoi!

1396
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,440
Let's talk about it again!

1397
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,040
I love you!

1398
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,900
I love you!

1399
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,900
Isn't it a listen-al 얼굴 to look so realistic?

1400
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,260
I love you so much

1401
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:39,580
I love you!

1402
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:47,620
I love you a lot, I love you so much!

1403
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:47,680
stands up

1404
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,260
I love you so much, I love you so much!

1405
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:53,800
I love you so much!

1406
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,420
I love you

1407
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,860
I love you.

1408
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,240
I love you.

1409
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,380
I love you.

1410
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:07,520
I felt a strange feeling at that time

1411
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,660
So I walked on the black tile of the arcade

1412
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,400
I saw

1413
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:26,540
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgets

1414
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:33,620
A politician with a big face and a blue aunt on top of his eyes

1415
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:39,020
Turn around and see that corner

1416
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,660
I can see everyone

1417
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:52,240
There is a wall there, there must be a wall

1418
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,880
Everyone come on

1419
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,320
It's over

1420
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,440
To the town of the city

1421
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,560
Thank you!
