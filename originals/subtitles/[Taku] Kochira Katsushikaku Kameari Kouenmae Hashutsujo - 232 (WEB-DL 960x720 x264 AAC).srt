1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch TV, you should light up your own room and see the light behind it!

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,780
Nى chéo

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,040
nia chéo

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,920
nia chéo

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,960
Come to my place!

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,900
If you don't have money!

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,100
I don't have money but I'm still worried

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,960
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,160
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:55,940
Let's have a good time

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,420
Come to me if you're jobless

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm not here, but don't worry

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,480
Look, the red cloud is burning

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,060
Look, the red cloud is burning

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,140
Look, the red cloud is burning

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,220
Look, the red cloud is burning

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,680
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,500
I know, I know, I know

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,220
If you know, come to me quietly

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,300
Just wait a longer

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,860
I need to go to the toilet

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,120
Just stop

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,540
The red cloud is burning

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,400
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,920
I think I need to go to the toilet

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,400
I need to go to the toilet

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,940
I think I need to go to the toilet

28
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to run away

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
and the store is full of gaps,

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,540
so I think they're trying to make us look cool.

31
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,660
Well, it's a local convenience store

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,800
that the CEO just opened,

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,960
so I don't think it's impossible.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,200
Ryo-san, this is the CEO.

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,660
The CEO of a inexperienced convenience store.

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,380
Well, there are gaps,

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,520
but it's not all bad.

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,080
We need to be careful.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,860
I checked the tape for the last few days

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,220
of the Kameari 24 store,

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,140
and I found that there were strange people

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,200
showing up for a long time.

43
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,700
The thief said he would check in advance.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,500
You!

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,220
This is you, Ryo-san.

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
What? You look like...

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't look like...

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,140
This is you!

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,060
I think it's me, maybe.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,060
I think it's me, maybe.

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,320
Look at the tape carefully.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,080
Send it to me quickly.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,660
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,700
It's been 30 minutes since then,

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,840
and you're still reading it.

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,320
This is a patrol, sir.

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,880
I told you to leave it to me.

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,880
You're reading a manga, aren't you?

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,500
A manga!

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,900
Well, at first glance,

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,980
it looks like I'm reading a manga.

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,860
But actually,

63
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,240
it's a post-production, sir.

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,160
Post-production?

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,080
I had a feeling that the thief would come today,

66
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,100
so I pretended to be reading a manga...

67
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,400
Hey, send it to me three hours later.

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,700
Hey, I waited, but he didn't come much,

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,300
so I thought I'd go back to the station,

70
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,200
but as expected, the post-production continued.

71
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,840
Do you think I'm being deceived by such nonsense?

72
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,920
What's wrong with skipping the night shift and reading a manga?

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,700
It's not a stand-up.

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
It's a sitting reading.

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,300
Idiot!

76
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Don't you think you're embarrassed to be old?

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,900
Because I want to read the latest manga before anyone else!

78
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,280
Yeah?

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,700
I don't need any serious,

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,740
stupid,

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,200
lazy,

82
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,900
and useless police officers like you,

83
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,440
Katsushika-cho!

84
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,720
I'll just make you my boss!

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,660
It's so hard!

86
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,780
Well, Mr. Ohara,

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,660
that's enough...

88
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,200
The chief executive, Fuyuki Toboki,

89
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,860
is my responsibility as a boss.

90
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,240
No,

91
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,700
as a store,

92
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,480
it's more secure to have a storekeeper.

93
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,980
Did you hear that, manager?

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Mr. Katsushika-cho,

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,960
please tell us more about it.

96
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
Well,

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,480
of the 24-5 shops in the town,

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,140
only the 5th store,

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,320
where Mr. Ryotsu often stands,

100
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,180
has not been affected by the robberies.

101
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,540
Hey,

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,820
did you hear that, manager?

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,560
I was doing my job while reading the manga.

104
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,920
What?

105
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,960
That was...

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,860
a flash.

107
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,860
This is the convenience store.

108
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,040
Wait for it.

109
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,960
That's just a flash.

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,020
I'll tell you what.

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,460
Come on.

112
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,480
I should!

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,440
There you go.

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,780
There's a lot of great things

115
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,560
You also have to come and see it.

116
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,420
Huh?

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:16,640
Hey,

118
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,240
I know the hotиз.

119
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,820
That's true.

120
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:18,980
The hotiz?

121
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
The hotiz?

122
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
You really want to come and see it?

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,000
You can simply use it and I'll give you

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,300
the information you need.

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Hey!

126
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,720
Hey!

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:28,940
Let's have some fun.

128
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,700
Convenience stores are exposed to the heavy traffic and the heavy traffic,

129
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,080
and they require a lot of security to get out of their way.

130
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,720
So, we, the Katsushika office,

131
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,760
will take the lead in the country and test the delivery police.

132
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,740
In other words, we will do the police officer's convenient store delivery.

133
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,620
What?

134
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,420
Convenience stores that are closer to the far station.

135
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,360
If you send the police officer to the convenience store one by one,

136
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,860
you can immediately work.

137
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,540
If there is a station in a nearby convenience store,

138
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,500
the city will be protected.

139
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,140
This is Columbus's great idea of one-by-two.

140
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,860
Oh.

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,540
First, my members of the park delivery office,

142
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,360
will work at the convenience store and prove the effectiveness.

143
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,180
Eventually, the delivery police will come.

144
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,620
The natural age will come.

145
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,280
The delivery police will revive the Japanese safety myth.

146
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,520
And then, the washing machine will come.

147
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,680
And when both of them come,

148
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Chinese people will take their places in the car,

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,900
and that's all they have to do.

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,280
It's hard to get rid of the old man now.

151
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,300
That's the kind of culture that's good.

152
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,060
And the people who run my department,

153
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,440
Utsu.

154
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,660
Of course.

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,840
Andышi.

156
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:49,980
This is us.

157
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,820
Okay.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,180
Well, it's time you left JESSICA.

159
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,160
Soon, they'll be working here.

160
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,480
We'll keep up the work.

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,280
They are friendly.

162
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,320
I know.

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,360
"Akari 21st Century"

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,540
I'm too conspicuous here.

165
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,180
I'll move the bookshelf over there and...

166
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
"Akari 21st Century"

167
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
Ryo-chan!

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,440
Don't be selfish!

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,760
Do your best for the sake of the bright 21st century, Butchon!

170
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,760
"Akari 21st Century"

171
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,280
The image of the neighborhood is also the home of work,

172
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,940
so like the reception hall of the department store...

173
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,740
"Akari 21st Century"

174
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,640
Smile, smile!

175
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,120
"Akari 21st Century"

176
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,140
Can you do that?

177
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,020
If you can't handle the changes of the times like these,

178
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,780
I'll give you a reward box!

179
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,980
What?

180
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,500
Thank you for your hard work.

181
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:38,980
President.

182
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,420
Oh, you're good at it.

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,740
Right? Right?

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,200
You're all fit.

185
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,260
Right? Right?

186
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,420

I'm a regular customer.

Of course.

Yes, sir.

Then, I'm in your way.

201
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
Are you going too?

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,900

Just sitting here will make the crime more difficult.

220

Please don't make any unnecessary comments about the convenience store business.

221
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,440
Working at the 5th store?

222
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,460
What? Did I just say that?

223
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
Oh, well...

224
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,580
Now, you can read the manga's latest volume right away.

225
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,460
It's all-you-can-read!

It's the best!

231
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,920
Thank you, Kanbei.

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,760
Ouch.

233
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,680
Kanbei, I'm sorry, but can you pat my shoulder?

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,040
Okay.

235
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Daito Rishi.

236
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

237
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,220
He left what he dropped behind.

238
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,220
Here.

239
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,780
He's quite the talker.

240
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,220
Hey...

241
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,100
What is it?

242
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,700
Your...

243
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,540
Listen, Chief!

244
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,920
The cash is for the convenience store business.

245
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,100
Oh, it's nothing.

246
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,580
I'll take a patrol now.

247
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,260
It's past 11 o'clock now.

248
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,400
Oh, it's them.

249
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,820
Are you sure, chief?

250
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,180
I can't believe you're talking about the convenience store business!

251
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,900
This is the police officer's mission.

252
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,220
The fruit juice looks good.

253
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,060
Yeah.

254
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,580
You're high school students, right?

255
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,140
Ah!

256
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,220
I was just looking at you!

257
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah.

258
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
Zaya, let's go home and study!

259
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah.

260
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,580
Put your shirts in your pants properly.

261
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,120
You're high school students, right?

262
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,140
You shouldn't read such books!

263
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,840
It's past 11 o'clock in the night!

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,960
Your parents won't scold you?

265
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,280
My parents...

266
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,700
Yeah, they're fine.

267
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Anyway, go home and sleep.

268
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,000
You have school tomorrow, right?

269
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,500
Yes!

270
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,480
What a trouble.

271
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,700
No, no!

272
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,420
If you put the bread on the bottom, it'll collapse, right?

273
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,160
Put the heavy stuff on the bottom and put the soft stuff on top.

274
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,260
Okay.

275
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,060
Thank you.

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,420
Thank you for waiting.

277
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,540
You're welcome.

278
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,300
Thank you.

279
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,260
Thank you.

280
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,180
And you dropped the food you dropped earlier.

281
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,860
You put it in a bag and handed it to the customer.

282
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,540
At that time, you should replace it with new food.

283
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,780
Shut up.

284
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,680
What?

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,360
It has nothing to do with it.

286
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,680
When you talk, look at the other person.

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,460
Shut up, old man.

288
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,960
You're the kind of person who doesn't care about others.

289
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
You're the kind of person who doesn't have the power to have a soul.

290
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,960
You're the kind of person who doesn't have the power to have a soul.

291
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,460
I don't have the strength.

292
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,400
People...

293
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,920
What are you doing?

294
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,300
You're on a job.

295
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,060
I don't understand.

296
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,020
What are you doing?

297
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,160
I have to find a way to do this for three hours.

298
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,120
I don't understand this.

299
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,880
I can't see, I'm losing control.

300
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm running!

301
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,900
I can't see too much.

302
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm losing control!

303
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,880
I can't see anything.

304
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,960
I can't feel my body.

305
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,940
No, not at all.

306
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,720
What?

307
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,760
All right, tell me this.

308
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Huh? What? President!

309
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,880
Only Mr. Ohara's store is selling very low.

310
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,060
It's a big problem.

311
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,160
What? That's impossible!

312
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,120
The First Store

313
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,980
It's true. The first store is selling very low.

314
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
What's the matter?

315
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,560
Mr. Ohara, he removed all the ugly books from the store.

316
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,720
He also banned young boys who are under 16 from entering the store after 10 p.m.

317
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,200
He also quit his part-time job late at night.

318
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,400
That's a business obstacle!

319
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,780
What's your authority?

320
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,020
I guess the idea of making a second-store in a convenience store itself was too much.

321
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,840
Should we stop it?

322
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,220
Hey, wait a minute!

323
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,700
Look here!

324
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,220
Reiko's second store and Nakagawa's third store are selling at a high price

325
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,400
with more customers for two people.

326
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,480
Reiko's second store and Nakagawa's third store are selling at a high price with more customers for two people.

327
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,720
The price was low because of the number of customers.

328
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,120
The cost to make a second store in a convenience store is count was written in the code.

329
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,800
The cost to make a second store in a convenience store is count was written in the code.

330
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,560
There was a big sales issue.

331
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,480
I don't care about the boss.

332
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
I don't want to be confused anymore.

333
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,600
I don't want to be confused anymore.

334
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,440
He said that the price for each batch was only 2.5p.

335
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,040
He said that the price for each batch was only 2.5p.

336
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,640
He said that the price for each batch was only 2.5p.

337
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,420
All you have to do is get more vegetables.

338
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,180
all you have to do is get more vegetables.

339
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,860
All you have to do is get more vegetables.

340
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,300
We eat as much sweet food as possible.

341
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,920
All you have to do is get more vegetables.

342
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,220
Make it a nutritious milk or fish.

343
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,900
Eww!

344
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,660
Wait a minute!

345
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,480
You'll lose your calcium!

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
What's with that old man?

347
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,080
Gross!

348
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll take this.

349
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,340
Yes.

350
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,300
Manager!

351
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,060
Oh, Ryotsu.

352
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,900
Didn't you just preach to the girls who went out?

353
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
No, not that much.

354
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,840
You should just sit here quietly.

355
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,000
If you preach, the customers will run away.

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,980
But, Ryotsu, there's something you can't see.

357
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,840
Most customers go to convenience stores to relax.

358
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
What's the point of living like that?

359
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,960
You quit your part-time job, didn't you?

360
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,680
But...

361
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,980
130 yen.

362
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,480
Oh!

363
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,760
You should read the newspaper like this, not patrol.

364
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,880
You're not good at it.

365
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,760
Oh, Yasuoka.

366
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,320
Huh?

367
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,840
Hello.

368
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,460
What's up?

369
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,360
I'm worried.

370
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,340
I was close to the game, so I was going to quit it.

371
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,900
Game?

372
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,580
Huh?

373
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,360
Huh?

374
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,580
But maybe...

375
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,540
Isn't this him?

376
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,160
What?

377
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,500
When Yasuoka was the champion, he was drunk and was about to give up.

378
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,700
After all, the case was about the defense of the world, but he was beaten by the general public.

379
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,740
So his title was taken and he was missing.

380
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,920
I wonder if he has any questions about his ability to return to the ring after a year and seven months.

381
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,380
Oh, so that's what it is.

382
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,240
Well...

383
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,660
I'll pay you later!

384
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,180
Yes!

385
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,480
Yasuoka, you're good!

386
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,580
Mr. Koukaku!

387
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,100
I didn't know you had that kind of situation.

388
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,860
In other words, I thought you were the Freeter of this time.

389
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,040
Freeter?

390
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,640
You know me?

391
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,060
As long as you keep doing that, you can't get out of there!

392
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,700
I heard that.

393
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,400
Oh, that's right. Don't overdo your nutrition drink.

394
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,460
I can't win without overdoing it.

395
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,220
Thank you. I'm on a diet right now, so I'll drink it when I'm done with my weight.

396
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,040
Yeah, then.

397
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,740
Do your best. Do your best!

398
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,740
Young people are at the convenience store of the father-in-law who sells the best wine,

399
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,200
and the one who sells the best wine, and the one who sells the best wine,

400
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,180
and the one who sells the best wine, and the one who sells the best wine,

401
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
and the one who sells the best wine, and he's good at everything,

402
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,260
but who sells the best wine.

403
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,400
Yesterday, I came to consult with work,

404
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,540
though.

405
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, you? Well, you quit your company, didn't you?

406
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,800
After that, I took an office exam.

407
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,000
That was good. But the hard work is still to come.

408
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,680
Don't without this firmness.

409
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
Tha ...

410
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,300
Then...

411
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,460
... do your best.

412
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,140
Hello~

413
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,300
You are ...

414
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Ehehehe

415
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,400
Ah!

416
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,160
Oh, it's you guys. I've mistaken you for something else.

417
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,460
We graduated from Cogel!

418
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,600
Haru is a college student.

419
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,140
You haven't changed much except for your clothes.

420
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,720
Isn't it a waste to go to college in that condition?

421
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,360
That's terrible!

422
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,140
Ahaha, sorry, sorry.

423
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,500
You should study properly.

424
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,820
Yes!

425
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,620
Oh, Mr. Ohara.

426
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,680
Thank you for the place where you were lost the other day.

427
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
This is this.

428
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,680
Taro, say hello.

429
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,820
Hello!

430
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,320
Oh, hello.

431
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,100
This is a book.

432
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,860
Ah, no. Grandma, I can't accept this.

433
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,160
Well, don't say that.

434
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,520
If the manager's shop gives it back, it's safe for now.

435
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,480
However!

436
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,200
Eh!

437
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,240
President!

438
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,600
A new problem.

439
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,140
Currently, Mr. Ohara's No. 1 store is in the surrounding area, and Mr. Ryochi's No. 5 store is...

440
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,980
Really!?

441
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,580
Is my shop also lost to a monk!?

442
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,780
This is a problem.

443
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,100
I'll just restore Mr. Ryochi's No. 5 store.

444
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,920
Eh, wait a minute!

445
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,600
I'll get it back soon, so don't hurry!

446
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,860
The delivery police is my idea in the first place.

447
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,640
Why does my shop have to be restored?

448
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,680
What?

449
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,560
If I make a little effort to make a convenience store,

450
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,440
I can sell it in a blink of an eye.

451
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,240
Ah, that's no good.

452
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,940
Eh?

453
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,300
That's a new product.

454
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,640
Hmm.

455
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
You can't put it down there.

456
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,140
Huh?

457
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,460
The charm of convenience stores is new products.

458
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,680
The repeaters look forward to that, so they come.

459
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,260
I will also make my own pop like this, and I will appeal to new products more and more.

460
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,560
Yes.

461
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,040
I made a paid standing reading corner like this.

462
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,360
Let's see.

463
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,800
I collect 300 yen per hour for a oberez book.

464
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,260
A manga book is 100 yen.

465
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,240
Huh?

466
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,900
Hmm.

467
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:00,160
I make a game corner, lure children, and place children's favorite lyrics at eye level.

468
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,860
Huh?

469
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,720
Don't you have any ideas that are useful or do boxing?

470
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,140
What?

471
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,620
If you make this much effort, sales will increase immediately.

472
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,700
It's not growing.

473
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,740
It's actually going down.

474
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,220
Ryōchi's 5 store seems to be dependent on children.

475
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,520
Even if children are many, the cost of using is low.

476
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,300
Hmm.

477
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,220
What about other stores?

478
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,240
Oh, Ryōchi.

479
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,180
Eh?

480
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,660
Me?

481
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,480
I see.

482
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,520
Brand products are popular for girls.

483
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,620
Brand?

484
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,500
Oh, wait a minute.

485
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,340
I want to choose this one.

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,140
That's right.

487
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,720
Try to guess.

488
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,800
Hmm.

489
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,160
Oh, this one?

490
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,480
Oh, this one is good.

491
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,200
This one is good.

492
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,920
What is he doing?

493
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

494
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,080
I was giving advice on customer clothes.

495
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,200
What?

496
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,080
You're doing that?

497
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,900
Yes.

498
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,380
I gave advice on online sales to students.

499
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,160
I heard that the reputation was good, and I wanted to buy products from the manufacturer.

500
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,820
Oh, I'm calling again.

501
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,360
Bye.

502
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,820
I didn't know.

503
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,760
Reiko has excellent sense of fashion.

504
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
What about Nakagawa?

505
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,140
I have 90% of female students as customers.

506
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,280
I can sell character products and stuffed animals.

507
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,160
I think it's a pretty good deal in total.

508
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,260
Stop it!

509
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,400
The rule was to not interfere with the convenience store business and not talk about it.

510
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,060
It is natural that I, who have been strictly following the rules, will be late.

511
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,740
Everyone, I have a regular contract, and I have been cooperating with the store.

512
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh, yeah.

513
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,260
How about the shop of the emperor?

514
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,560
Hmm?

515
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,820
Oh, hello, Ryo-san?

516
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,680
What?

517
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,600
My shop hasn't changed much.

518
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,000
Hey!

519
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,680
I'm losing to someone who hasn't done anything.

520
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,920
Hmm.

521
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,280
Are you going to stop, Ryo-san?

522
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
No, I'm begging you.

523
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,660
Give me one more chance.

524
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,120
I understand.

525
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,920
The problem is not the number of items.

526
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,660
I've been pampering customers.

527
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,980
The key point of selling is preaching.

528
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
The modern people who gather at the convenience store are preaching to their fathers.

529
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,300
I want your preaching.

530
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,500
I'll go to the line of the head of the department and aim for the top sales at once.

531
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm here.

532
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,740
Cheers.

533
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,880
Yes.

534
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,020
And?

535
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,100
Hey!

536
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,360
What time do you think it is?

537
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,260
4:30 p.m.

538
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,040
I don't remember raising you to be such a child.

539
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,500
I haven't been raised.

540
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
Don't talk back.

541
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,720
No way.

542
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,320
Hey!

543
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,720
What's this?

544
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,520
I won't forgive you for wasting it.

545
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,540
I'm sorry.

546
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,520
I haven't finished talking yet.

547
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,120
You're all grown-ups, so you have to eat more nutritious food.

548
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,140
Is this dog food?

549
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,860
You can't say you don't like it.

550
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,980
There's nothing dogs can't eat that humans can't eat.

551
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,760
Yes.

552
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,880
I'll take 13,260 yen.

553
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,920
Hey, stop reading.

554
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,200
That's not my child.

555
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:09,860
Get out.

556
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,140
Hey, you guys!

557
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,860
Who are you feeding?

558
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,180
You're not?

559
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,900
What?

560
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,620
I've got a little something to feed you.

561
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,200
I'm hungry.

562
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,340
Listen to me, kid.

563
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,360
I want to eat.

564
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,400
Eat.

565
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,740
Eat.

566
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,240
Eat.

567
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,480
I want to eat.

568
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,520
I heard that the 5th store is closed.

569
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,520
Huh?

570
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,660
Ah!

571
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,780
Hello.

572
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,460
Oh, there you are. I've been waiting for you.

573
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,920
Well, have a drink.

574
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,080
Yes.

575
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,380
You bought it, didn't you?

576
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,680
Well...

577
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,960
I'll take this.

578
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:04,960
Oh, sure.

579
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,180
Be patient with the beer until you recover.

580
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,980
Yes.

581
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,000
Here's your drink.

582
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,500
Oh, thank you.

583
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,940
Here. This is for you.

584
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,800
Thank you very much.

585
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,600
Congratulations, Yasuoka.

586
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,720
Congratulations, champion.

587
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,020
I'm not a champion yet.

588
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,060
Anyway, I'm glad.

589
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,040
Cheers!

590
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,720
Cheers!

591
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,160
It's good.

592
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,520
Mr. Ohara, thank you for your lecture.

593
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,080
You're a bad person.

594
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,380
Thanks to this convenience store,

595
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,580
I was able to meet Mr. Ohara and be reborn.

596
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm glad to meet a young man like you.

597
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,700
Oh, you two are a perfect couple.

598
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,100
Huh?

599
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,780
It's my idea.

600
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,640
Peace.

601
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,740
I'll have a drink with Mr. Ohara.

602
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,600
Sure, Mr. Ohara.

603
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,860
Thank you.

604
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,320
You're here, aren't you?

605
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Oh, I'm not yours.

606
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,040
No, I'm not.

607
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,180
Then give me a drink.

608
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,960
Are you serious?

609
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,500
Take this, and...

610
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,580
Oh, that's...

611
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:38,300
My geldia, honey.

612
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,480
I brought it.

613
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:40,780
This is exactly what it is.

614
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,900
I don't care

615
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,720
Even if I lie or cheat

616
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm helping someone, sometimes

617
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,600
Baby, do you know me?

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm heading to tomorrow

619
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,980
Nice breathing

620
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,620
Don't get sick

621
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,880
I'll do what I have to do

622
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,620
Cute breathing

623
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,980
It's hard to understand

624
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,740
I want to show you my talent

625
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,680
It's better than looking down on me

626
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,240
Na na na na

627
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,060
Na na na na

628
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,020
Na na na na

629
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,380
Who are you?

630
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,360
What?

631
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,900
You're the owner of this tsukudani shop?

632
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,580
What are you saying?

633
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,960
This is my place

634
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,620
This is my father's shop

635
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,080
You look strange

636
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,840
Are you shooting a TV drama?

637
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,500
Next time, live broadcast

638
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,820
I'm counting on you

639
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,860
There is a wall there

640
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,920
There must be a wall

641
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,200
Come on everyone

642
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,840
To our town

643
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you
