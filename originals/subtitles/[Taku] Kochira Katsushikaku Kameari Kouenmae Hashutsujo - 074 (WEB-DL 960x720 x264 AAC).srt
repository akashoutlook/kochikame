Translated by Shion

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,580
I look up at the setting sun floating in the river

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,560
When I kick the love stone, it flies to my shoes

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,180
I wonder if I'm going to the gym I used to work out

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at for being a

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,440
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only win

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yoke is strangely gentle

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,380
From the fountain of the Tungari-boshi

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,160
The sun goes down to the Kaishakuten

10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,520
I lost my happiness again because of the Katsushika Shiba

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm a fool

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,220
Since morning

14
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,980
Absolute security 4 visits

15
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,160
An announcement for traveling to Hawaii?

16
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,520
Going to Hawaii at the karaoke party.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,700
It 's so strict.

18
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,620
We're in trouble even in the afternoon

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,360
You're still here after all

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,920
Hey, Grandma

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,760
I bought all that stuff

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Then we'll run out of money.

23
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,120
Is there anyone here, Grandma?

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,060
I'll take you to the hospital!

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,220
Hey, Grandma!

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
Don't let him get away!

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,300
If you're here, I'll give you a reply!

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,200
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,600
You look so serious.

30
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,420
Don't tell me you're in love with someone.

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,700
No, I'm not, Mr. Ryo.

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,520
Actually, I...

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

34
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm the old man who took the money from the Hawaii trip to the

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Inchiki Travel Company.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,600
I mean, you don't have to laugh.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,480
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,740
Everyone was looking forward to it.

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,760
It's a shame.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Huh?

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,180
What happened to that money?

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,540
I was trying to do something about it.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,320
We all helped each other out, but...

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,540
Uh-oh.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,500
There are over 20 people in the

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,620
Yeah.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,080
Okay, leave it to me.

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,760
What?

51
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,380
I'll take everyone to Hawaii with that money.

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,560
Can you do that?

53
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,800
Leave it to me.

54
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,740
There's no letter that's impossible in my dictionary.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,080
Forty-nine, forty-six, twenty-eight, forty-nine, forty-nine, fifty-nine...

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,880
Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,800
I have 500,000 yen.

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,160
That's a lot.

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,640
It's for two or three people.

60
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,380
What are you going to do?

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,980
What about your husband?

62
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,340
Of course.

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,540
Ask Nakagawa or Reiko.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,220
They're kind people.

65
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,340
The 20 or 30 of my grandparents will take me to Hawaii for free.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,040
My grandparents are happy.

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
I have a profit of 500,000 yen.

68
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,180
I thought that was it.

69
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,640
What?

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,640
There's no Nakagawa or Reiko.

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,060
Oh, I see.

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,320
I heard that they were both on vacation.

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,100
They went abroad yesterday.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,620
Don't joke around at this important time.

75
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,660
Yeah.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,640
Yes, I'm Nakagawa.

77
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,160
Nakagawa! Where are you?

78
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,720
Senpai?

79
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,440
I'm on vacation.

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,400
Come back immediately.

81
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,400
Well, that's...

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,920
What?

83
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,000
I heard that there was trouble at the Amazon resource survey site.

84
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm heading to the site.

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,220
We're in the middle of the jungle that can't be used by a helicopter.

86
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,140
So I can't move right away.

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,940
Senpai?

88
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Yes, Reiko.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,260
Ah, Ryo-chan.

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,380
What's wrong?

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,060
What?

92
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,520
You're not going back to Japan?

93
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,340
That's impossible.

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,300
The South Pole is in danger.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,780
Come here from Ryo-chan.

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,460
Damn it.

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,280
They're useless when I say so.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,580
It's impossible for us to go to Hawaii without you two.

99
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,920
I should return the money.

100
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:47,980
Wait.

101
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,300
There must be something else.

102
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,420
There shouldn't be.

104
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,380
Ryo-chan, are you there?

105
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,060
What?

106
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,160
Maybe you're Hidami's grandmother?

107
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,660
No.

108
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,080
You're because of me.

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm really worried right now.

110
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,740
Tell me what you're thinking later.

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,020
I'm worried later.

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,820
No, thanks to Ryo, I can go to Hawaii.

113
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,860
He said so.

114
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,820
Hmm.

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,880
And he's helping me out.

116
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,460
The sweet potato pork roll.

117
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,420
Oh...

118
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,340
Has this information been transmitted now?

119
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,660
This may be creepy.

120
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,180
Senpai...

121
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,520
And here's the yam構.

122
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,400
But what's wrong?

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,100
Ah...

124
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,380
How about some lunch?

125
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,860
Fresh vegetables from my relatives.

126
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,760
Thank you very much, Ryo-san.

127
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,680
It's our first time to travel abroad.

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
It's our first time to travel abroad.

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,480
That's right.

130
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,400
That's why we're looking forward to our next trip.

131
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,780
Please, Ryo-san.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,940
Is that so? It's your first time?

133
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,520
Don't worry.

134
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,320
We, Ryo-tsu Kankou, will take you safely to Hawaii.

135
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,840
We?

136
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,940
Us too?

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,040
For the citizens.

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,040
Of course we'll help you.

139
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,980
Of course.

140
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,920
That's why.

141
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
Don't worry, everyone.

142
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
Please leave it to us, Ryo-tsu Kankou.

143
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm so happy.

144
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,220
Now we can make a souvenir for our maid.

145
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,040
Thank you.

146
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,660
Thank you.

147
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Thank you.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,440
Thank you.

149
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,080
Leave it to us.

150
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,460
This is so unreasonable!

151
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,800
How can we make a souvenir of 500,000 yen and bring 20 people to Hawaii?

152
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,180
Don't tell me you'll let us pay for this.

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
That's impossible.

154
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,760
Our house loan is 19 years old.

155
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,080
I don't know how much you can pay me.

156
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,840
You just have to lend me your hand.

157
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,740
Now, I'll explain the Trip Plan.

158
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,740
There is a map of Hawaii.

159
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,580
Ryo-sama, this is a map of the Kanto region.

160
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,300
Look!

161
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,060
There is Hawaii here!

162
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,060
That's Kanagawa, isn't it?

163
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,960
According to the source,

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,920
there is a place called Hawaii in the far west of the Pacific.

165
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,120
But the road leading there is difficult.

166
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,900
It takes 40 days to reach Kanlinmaru.

167
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,840
Everyone!

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,360
It's impossible for an old man to carry the weight of a man.

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,460
So he decided to go to Hawaii.

170
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,600
I had a bad feeling about it.

171
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
I'm not kidding.

172
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
How can you fool the old people like that?

173
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,580
Everyone is looking forward to the trip to Hawaii.

174
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,900
Are you going to have a dream with the old people who have no reason to go?

175
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,000
It would be terrible to take them to Hawaii.

176
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,540
I can't help you.

177
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,860
What is this?

178
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,880
This is the gift of Saori that I received the other day.

179
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,340
Someone took it.

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,960
I was going to give it to my sister.

181
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,160
Who was it?

182
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,180
If the trip is canceled,

183
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,540
there may be old people who will be shocked.

184
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,760
Let's enjoy the feeling of traveling to Hawaii.

185
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,840
I see.

186
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,380
Do you understand?

187
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,180
If it's for you,

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,420
I'll go in the fire or in the water.

189
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Let's have a fun trip to Hawaii together!

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Yes!

191
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,620
Yes!

192
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,820
Yes!

193
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,160
Yes!

194
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,900
Yes!

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:10,960
Yes!

196
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,580
Yes!

197
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,740
I was so excited I couldn't sleep last night.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,140
I dream about Hawaii.

199
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,800
It's all thanks to you.

200
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,900
Oh!

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,440
Someone is here!

202
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,420
Hello everyone at the ruin operation.

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,420
Thank you.

204
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,820
Hello.

205
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,380
Well, we've been waiting.

206
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,850
Let's have a fun trip to Hawaii together!

207
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,660
See you later!

208
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,880
"Narita Airport"

209
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,280
Thank you for waiting.

210
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,500
We will arrive at Narita Airport soon.

211
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:11,920
We will arrive at Narita Airport soon.

212
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
Look at this!

213
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,520
This is the Super Jumbo that will take you to Hawaii.

214
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,820
It's a good souvenir for your grandchildren.

215
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,560
Thank you, thank you.

216
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,920
It's completely different from the picture.

217
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,440
What?

218
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,220
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,720
There is a body, a wing, and a tail.

220
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,540
It's exactly the same.

221
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,640
But there is no propeller in this picture.

222
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,840
It rotates at high speed, so it is not reflected in the picture.

223
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,160
You may not know it because you do not have the opportunity to fly.

224
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,820
The propeller is installed to stabilize the current near the main wing of the latest type of jet lander.

225
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,960
That's common sense.

226
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
I see.

227
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,500
As expected of Mr. Ryo.

228
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,620
It's a good sign.

229
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,480
Please be careful of your feet.

230
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,960
Welcome.

231
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,000
Welcome to Tokyo.

232
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,660
The Stardust is beautiful.

233
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,340
Oh, my.

234
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

235
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,080
My feet are cramping.

236
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,860
You have to be careful.

237
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,100
But you have a good butt.

238
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,120
I don't like it.

239
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,460
My hands are slippery.

240
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm dizzy.

241
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,080
I can't move.

242
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,260
My feet are cramping.

243
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,380
If you know Maria is a man, you may be shocked.

244
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,440
We will soon depart for Narita Airport and head to Hawaii Honolulu Airport.

245
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,940
Please fasten your seat belts.

246
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,100
Oh.

247
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,440
Is this all we bought?

248
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,820
This is like a volunteer.

249
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm grateful just to get money.

250
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,280
Mr. Ryo.

251
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,320
What?

252
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,160
I want you to say hello to the captain.

253
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,780
What?

254
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,860
By the way, the captain will say something before we depart.

255
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,400
Wait. I'll go now.

256
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,940
What's wrong with the captain?

257
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
He must be busy.

258
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

259
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm Yatarou, the captain's opposite.

260
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Nice to meet you.

261
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,420
Nice to meet you, too.

262
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,060
Hello.

263
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,520
Hello, Mr. Captain.

264
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,600
Hello, Mr. Captain.

265
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,260
Hello, Mr. Captain.

266
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,320
Hello, what can I do for you?

267
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,220
Please call Mr. Ryo.

268
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,960
I see.

269
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,260
You old man.

270
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,860
Hello.

271
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,660
How can I help you?

272
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,260
Mr. Ryo.

273
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,400
Can you ask the captain how long it takes to get to Hawaii?

274
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,940
Mr. Captain, we want to know the flight time.

275
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
Yes, sir.

276
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,320
The flight time is 6 hours.

277
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,920
I can hear you clearly.

278
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,880
I'm sorry, but can you come out?

279
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,460
The flight time is about 6 hours.

280
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,440
Mr. Ryo, where can I get your passport?

281
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,540
I have it in my hall.

282
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,680
You don't have to show it to me.

283
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,520
By the way, Mr. Captain.

284
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,260
Yes?

285
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,300
Mr. Ryo.

286
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,380
Yes, sir.

287
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,560
Mr. Captain.

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,300
Yes.

289
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,260
Mr. Ryo.

290
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,280
What do you want?

291
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,640
I don't know.

292
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,420
You can't do this forever.

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Let's go, Maria.

294
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay, Mr. Ryo.

295
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,320
Are you ready?

296
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,700
I'm ready.

297
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,460
I'm ready, too.

298
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,020
It's the captain's reverse-flying car.

299
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,320
I'll take off now.

300
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,280
It's moving.

301
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,340
I was told to lend me the plane that was being dismantled.

302
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,920
I thought I'd use it.

303
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm not going to be fooled.

304
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,000
Here, Maria, from the top.

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,620
Hello, S logical to the maximum.

306
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,580
Hello, there.

307
00:12:59,580 --> 00:12:59,840
Hello, there.

308
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,020
Hello, there.

309
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,800
Is there a reason why?

310
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,880
It doesn't feel like it's going to be a big step, but I can tell you're going to be really fast.

311
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,500
Really?

312
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,820
Why not?

313
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,580
Theторов and Ryo, stop moving.

314
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,020
Please.

315
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,460
You're going down?

316
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,040
I was told you should be careful when taking off.

317
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,900
Oh, I see.

318
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,700
You have to be careful.

319
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,180
Yeah.

320
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,480
I can't even read the guide book.

321
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,600
Don't look outside when you're going up.

322
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,060
There's a neon right there.

323
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,680
No, it's a symptom of neon disease.

324
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,000
Neon disease?

325
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,240
The guide book doesn't say that.

326
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,760
It's in reality.

327
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,280
When you look outside from the plane,

328
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,860
there are things on the ground that look big,

329
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,860
and at the end, you'll see a pink elephant or a white crocodile,

330
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,120
or anything that doesn't exist.

331
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,140
It's a terrible disease.

332
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
I-Is there such a disease?

333
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,420
It's okay for now.

334
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,280
It'll be better if you close your eyes for a while.

335
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm scared.

336
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,660
What's wrong?

337
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,920
You've been staying still for a while.

338
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,740
I was caught by a sphere.

339
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,640
The plane is stuck.

340
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,880
What?

341
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,460
Don't say such stupid things, Grandpa.

342
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,680
The signal...

343
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,320
No, it's just a headwind,

344
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,240
and I feel like I've stopped.

345
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,260
This is the common sense of Super Jambo.

346
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,700
Anyway, you're not allowed to enter here except for the people involved.

347
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
Please return to your seat.

348
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm sorry about that.

349
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,580
Give me a meal.

350
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,080
I'll let the food focus my nerves.

351
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,160
And I'll give you plenty of alcohol to make you sleep.

352
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,380
Okay, I understand, Master Ryo.

353
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,780
Thank you for waiting.

354
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,260
It's time for dinner.

355
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,420
Here you are.

356
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,580
Oh, this is the meal inside the plane.

357
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,200
I've never seen this before.

358
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,120
It's going to last a long time.

359
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm sorry.

360
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,420
Please give it to me as soon as possible.

361
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,160
Okay.

362
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,220
It's made by Maria.

363
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,220
It's better than the real meal inside the plane.

364
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,400
Oh, this is good.

365
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,500
It's going to last a long time.

366
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,840
Thank you.

367
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, how about some alcohol?

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,160
I've been waiting for a long time.

369
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,740
Anyway, there's plenty of time in Hawaii.

370
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,260
Please drink more and more.

371
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,420
Doug, you're such a great old lady.

372
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,480
I'll take a breath too.

373
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,960
Huh?

374
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,240
What the hell?

375
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,540
What are you doing?

376
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,100
What are you doing?

377
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,620
I got caught by that stupid crane.

378
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,640
Ah, I'm sorry.

379
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm sorry.

380
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,380
What are you doing, Fr. Genie?

381
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,700
What?

382
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,520
Is It raining?

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,360
Well, it's me.

384
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,040
You're going to get your ass kicked!

385
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
What are you looking at?

386
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,420
You're going to get your ass kicked!

387
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,260
You kiss my ass!

388
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,340
Your ass is Momo's.

389
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,640
Hey!

390
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,740
H-hurry, they are in our way!

391
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,240
No way!

392
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,080
U-ouw!

393
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,320
They are too strong!

394
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,940
Right! Right!

395
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,800
A-young man?

396
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,860
This is the Kuranohi.

397
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,640
T-they're breaking through Lankin Ryu right now.

398
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,000
Keep the seatbelts tight!

399
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,620
Nankiryu! It's Nankiryu!

400
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,000
Gear Pocket!

401
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,820
How many do you want?

402
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,140
What's that?

403
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,720
We're going to the Miura beach!

404
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,580
I'm counting on you!

405
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,720
Here we are!

406
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,260
How's the preparation?

407
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,580
Perfect.

408
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,620
From anywhere you look, this is Hawaii.

409
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,240
You know, it's a beach house.

410
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,660
Great job!

411
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,780
Everyone, we've arrived in Hawaii!

412
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,040
Now, get up and get ready to get off!

413
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,260
We've really arrived in Hawaii?

414
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,620
I'm sure it's not like that.

415
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,620
Now, it's the Hawaii we've been longing for!

416
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,580
Why are we here?

417
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,100
It's a long trip.

418
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
You can see the beach right after you get off.

419
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
That's America, isn't it?

420
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes, it is!

421
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,640
Welcome to Hawaii!

422
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,520
Welcome to Hawaii!

423
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,460
I feel like I've been here for a long time.

424
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,960
Welcome to Hawaii.

425
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Oh, as expected of an outsider.

426
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Your body is big.

427
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,060
Give it to me.

428
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,300
What?

429
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,740
What's wrong?

430
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
What's wrong?

431
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,380
What's wrong?

432
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,060
Saori, please forgive me.

433
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,240
This is all for you.

434
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,860
What?

435
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh no, let me go, I'm going to drink.

436
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:36,860
What a cold day!

437
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,700
What's up to you?

438
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm just a guy.

439
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,520
No, it's just a stranger.

440
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,660
I know, I know.

441
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,460
Hey!

442
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,840
What are you doing?

443
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,680
What's wrong?

444
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,460
What's wrong?

445
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:55,560
Who is this?

446
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,720
What's wrong?

447
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,820
Now, is "monoca" a thing?

448
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,060
No!

449
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,160
Ahhh!

450
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,740
Aloha, pineapple, yes!

451
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,960
What are you saying?

452
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,440
Just go back to the station.

453
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm not going to Fuji!

454
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,780
That was a close call.

455
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,540
When you come to a tourist destination overseas,

456
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,680
you can get close to them like you're a friend,

457
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,920
and they'll steal your luggage.

458
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,280
Everyone, please be careful.

459
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,000
They're very similar.

460
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,520
Now, let's take you to a tourist destination in Hawaii.

461
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,580
First, this is the famous Waikiki Beach.

462
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,600
It's really wide.

463
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,280
You can't see it in Japan.

464
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,980
It's a long way.

465
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,080
But it seems like there are a lot of Japanese people.

466
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,040
Recently, there are a lot of Japanese people in every tourist destination.

467
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,760
That's the Diamond Head, which is also sung in the song.

468
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,160
It's a diamond-like shape.

469
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,340
I can sing that song.

470
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,720
Diamond?

471
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Diamond?

472
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,680
It's not a diamond, it's more like an island.

473
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,920
There are a lot of people like that.

474
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,780
And this is the King Kamehameha.

475
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,820
The king of Hawaii was also a little bent.

476
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,320
It's a lot different from the picture.

477
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,880
This is old.

478
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,660
It was repaired like that after the war.

479
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,040
That's the Kirauhe Ya-kazan.

480
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,460
This is Shinji Bay.

481
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,760
Recently, Hawaii is a wedding.

482
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,000
And this is the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

483
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,520
Please enjoy the taste of Hawaii tonight.

484
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,180
Itadakimasu.

485
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,740
Oh, sashimi and tempura.

486
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,820
Is there such a thing in Hawaii?

487
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,740
It's a hot fish sashimi and a shrimp tempura.

488
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
It's a specialty of Hawaii.

489
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,460
Excuse me.

490
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,100
I told you to make it look like Hawaii.

491
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,200
Even if you say so.

492
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,900
What's that?

493
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,280
Yes, it's a pot.

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,380
OMG.

495
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,860
Sir, what would you like?

496
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,000
It's a delicious tropical hot pot.

497
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,460
It's the most famous ingredient of this country.

498
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,620
It seems good.

499
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,580
There is hot pot in Hawaii.

500
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,940
Let's try.

501
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,940
The fish soup of this can be used for this dish.

502
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,120
And it will create a good harmony.

503
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,220
It's good to eat.

504
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,940
You believe in design.

505
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,180
Yes, it is.

506
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,640
Let's do better.

507
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,180
I don't care what you say.

508
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,540
I don't care what you say.

509
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,960
I don't care what you say.

510
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,600
I don't care what you say.

511
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,460
I don't care what you say.

512
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,460
I don't care what you say.

513
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,580
I don't care what you say.

514
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
I don't care what you say.

515
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,420
I don't care what you say.

516
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,340
I don't care what you say.

517
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,300
I don't care what you say.

518
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,160
I don't care what you say.

519
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,980
I don't care what you say.

520
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,100
I don't care what you say.

521
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
I don't care what you say.

522
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,400
I don't care what you say.

523
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,220
I don't care what you say.

524
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,860
I don't care what you say.

525
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,500
I don't care what you say.

526
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,320
I don't care what you say.

527
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,840
I don't care what you say.

528
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:06,980
I don't care what you say.

529
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,380
I don't care what you say.

530
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,380
I don't care what you say.

531
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't care what you say.

532
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,440
I don't care what you say.

533
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,820
I don't care what you say.

534
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,880
The passion of the young fire will be revived.

535
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,780
Me too.

536
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,640
Me too.

537
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,080
Me too.

538
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Lord Hirao?

539
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,040
Me too.

540
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,520
Me too.

541
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,700
Me too.

542
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Idiots!

543
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,540
Ryotsu, you are...

544
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,220
I didn't get injured, so I'm fine.

545
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,460
That's the problem.

546
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,040
Why are you like the people of the Kero club in Hawaii and the Miura club?

547
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,940
There's a deep reason for that.

548
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,800
What is it?

549
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,640
I wonder if Ryo is there.

550
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,300
Everyone.

551
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,680
Everyone, I'm really sorry for what this idiot did this time.

552
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
Why are you apologizing?

553
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,820
I'm here to say thank you today.

554
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,920
It was a really fun trip.

555
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,040
It's been a long time since I've been so noisy.

556
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,880
You are really young.

557
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,060
But what about Hawaii?

558
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,280
We went to Hawaii for sure.

559
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,460
It was Hawaii we even dreamed of.

560
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,620
Let's go on a trip together, Ryo.

561
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,200
This time, we'll go to Hawaii beyond the sea.

562
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:57,860
What?

563
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:58,620
What?

564
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,640
What?

565
00:23:59,820 --> 00:23:59,940
What?

566
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,400
What?

567
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,840
What?

568
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,520
What?

569
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,960
What?

570
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,800
What?

571
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:07,920
What?

572
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,060
What?

573
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,560
What?

574
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:08,600
What?

575
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:08,800
What?

576
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,160
What?

577
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,820
What?

578
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,060
What?

579
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,180
What?

580
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,940
Why?

581
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,040
What?

582
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,100
Why?

583
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,640
What?

584
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,840
What?

585
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,640
Ryo…

586
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,400
I know something is going on.

587
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,160
Please explain this to us.

588
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,460
What?

589
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,780
That's a pretty fancy book.

590
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,040
Those are here for you.

591
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,500
De de!

592
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,280
And it's decided

593
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,840
Bako!

594
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,760
And it flutters

595
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,100
Kuya!

596
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,280
And it's decided

597
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,540
And it's decided

598
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:51,900
Debe debe!

599
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,460
And it's decided

600
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:52,980
Debe debe!

601
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,480
Baki baki!

602
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,680
And it's decided

603
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,940
Baki baki!

604
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,640
Baki baki!

605
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:54,900
And it's decided

606
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,740
And it's decided

607
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,280
And it's decided

608
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,040
And it's decided

609
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,080
And it's decided

610
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,540
And it's decided

611
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,420
And it's decided

612
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:00,780
And it's decided

613
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,200
And it's decided

614
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,880
And it's decided

615
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,480
And it's decided

616
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
And it's decided

617
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,000
Look at tomorrow

618
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,100
And believe in yesterday

619
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Draw the universe

620
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
And stand on a plane

621
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,120
And the Mosquito will draw a circle

622
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,200
And draw a circle

623
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,060
And draw a circle

624
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,200
And draw a circle

625
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,500
Is this all right?!

626
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,280
No excuses!
