2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,960
If you're watching on TV, light up the room and try to look away.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,500
There's a cat cat

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,700
there's a cat arey

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,160
there's a cat cat

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,520
there's a cat cat

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,340
there's a cat cat

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,700
there's a cat cat

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,780
If there's a cat with no tail, come to my place!

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,900
even though I don't have one I'm worried

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,420
You'll be able to do something somehow

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,460
You'll be able to do something somehow

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,140
Come to me if you don't have a job

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one either, but don't worry

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,340
Look, it's burning

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,400
Ah, it's burning

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,740
Ah, it's burning

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,980
You'll be able to do something somehow

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
You know it, right?

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,400
You know it, you know it!

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know it, then be quiet and follow me!

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,100
Ohara-kun, what is the exact time to attack the base?

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,620
...E.

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,540
...Ah, yes, I'm right here.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,480
It's 9:56:48.

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,980
Apolo, 12 seconds ahead.

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,340
I heard that the general has been made to be a very strict festae,

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,300
I heard that you will be sent to the capital.

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,560
I have a direct call from the commander.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,780
No need to rush, Ohara.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,880
Let's go.

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,520
Yes sir.

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,560
I'm Ohara Tonda, the head of the Kazushika office.

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,700
Come in.

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,880
Excuse me.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry that you two had to come here.

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,480
It's not a big deal.

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,400
My idiot, Ryotsu, must have done something terrible again.

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Ryotsu?

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,740
Yes, the famous person of the Kazushika office.

42
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,740
I came here today because I have something to ask you.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Something to ask?

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Before that, let me introduce this person.

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,040
Tsukuda-san.

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,920
Long time no see, Tonda-kun.

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,340
I'm here to help you.

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,180
Ohara-kun, what are you doing?

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,360
This is the famous officer Tsukuda.

50
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,660
The famous officer?

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,900
He's the head of Sakurada-mune.

52
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,800
If you lower your head like that, it'll be hard to ask.

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,780
Raise your head.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,480
In fact, Tsukuda-san will retire tomorrow.

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,020
I see.

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,100
He has a career, but he's working hard on a lot of things.

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,740
He's a man.

59
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,640
The famous officer Tsukuda has been solved.

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,660
If it's true, he could be a police officer before me.

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,260
No, I'm not the top officer.

62
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,340
So, what do you want from the famous officer Tsukuda?

63
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,580
He said he'd like to work at the police station for a day before he retires.

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,440
The famous officer?

65
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,120
I wanted to work at the police station once since I joined the police.

66
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll ask you.

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,380
I'll ask you.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,940
Can you make Tsukuda-san's long-term dream come true?

69
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,240
I understand.

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,140
We'll take responsibility and let the famous officer do his best.

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,200
Thank you.

72
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,280
And don't let the people in the station get in the way.

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,640
Don't tell them that I'm the famous officer.

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,980
Yes, sir.

75
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,700
I understand.

76
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,460
Then, I'll leave the title to you.

77
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,960
Yes, sir.

78
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,100
The famous officer Tsukuda

79
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,740
Tsukuda's Wonderful Day

80
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,300
You're late.

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,860
It's already past 7:00.

82
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,480
I wonder if the road is crowded.

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,180
Ohara-kun, did you go directly to the police station?

84
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,420
What did you say?

85
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,620
It's bad, Ohara-kun.

86
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,480
If I go directly to the police station and see his state of work,

87
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
My neck will surely be blown away.

88
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,360
You are the most important, Mr. Chief!

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,580
Please get out of my way, Ohara-kun.

90
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,640
Ohara-kun

91
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,960
Are you going to retire today?

92
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,380
I'm only on a day off, but I'm looking forward to your help.

93
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,720
We're looking forward to your help.

94
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,840
Get out of my way, get out of my way, get out of my way!

95
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,960
Ohara-kun

96
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,080
Ohara-kun

97
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,400
Ohara-kun

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,840
Ohara-kun

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,620
Ohara-kun

100
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,260
Ohara-kun

101
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,040
Ohara-kun

102
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,820
Ohara-kun

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,300
Ohara-kun

104
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,040
What's wrong, the chief is still here?

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,440
I've been so in a hurry.

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
Oh, Reiko.

107
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,020
My newspaper didn't fly over.

108
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,940
I threw it in the trash.

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Did you throw it?

110
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,620
Why?

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,500
I was granted a job.

112
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,320
So it's better to not be behind 8 minutes.

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,980
What a man.

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,640
I'll be here for a day.

115
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,800
Tsukuda, who was supposed to work at the police station.

116
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,280
I'm an officer.

117
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,200
Officer?

118
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,220
You're still an officer at that age?

119
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
Oh...

120
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,080
I don't know if it's Tsukuda or Tsukudani,

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,580
but you're a very useless policeman.

122
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,360
Senpai, that's rude.

123
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,520
That's right.

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,780
Ryo-chan, apologize.

125
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,100
I've been hiring such useless old people for a long time,

126
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,120
so my salary hasn't been rising much.

127
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,700
You can say that so well.

128
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,380
You're always bothering everyone.

129
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,820
Shut up!

130
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,420
Oh, it's Tsukudani.

131
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,140
Um, I'm Tsukuda.

132
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Whatever your name is,

133
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
take off that red pencil.

134
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,600
Senpai, Tsukuda-san is an officer,

135
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,460
but he's a superior.

136
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,220
He's a superior, but an officer is an officer.

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,660
I'm the chief of the police.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,920
It's unusual for you to be the chief of the police at that age.

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,780
Don't call yourself a full-time officer.

140
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,900
What are you doing to Tsukuda-san?

141
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,620
Ouch!

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,260
What are you doing all of a sudden?

143
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,800
What are you doing, Chief Ohara?

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,180
Who do you think this person is?

145
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,140
What are you talking about, chief?

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,260
This person is...

147
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,900
I promised not to reveal my identity.

148
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,780
What's the matter, chief?

149
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,280
N-nothing.

150
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
But on the way to the meeting...

151
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,860
Don't make me look like that person is a superior because he's an officer.

152
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,560
I understand.

153
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,120
It's quite interesting.

154
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,480
Well, I'm going to go out for a walk today.

155
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,220
I'm going to be an assistant to the chief of the police.

156
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,520
That's a very reckless way of thinking.

157
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,280
Interesting.

158
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm going to go to the battle hall with the full-time officer, Tsukuda.

159
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,180
Ryotsu, be careful with your language.

160
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,860
Well, I'm going.

161
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,320
Chief Ohara...

162
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,600
You're right.

163
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Chief, chief, what's wrong?

164
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,900
He's a superior?

165
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,180
A superior?

166
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,880
Was he that great?

167
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,200
Ohara, you can't help but cry.

168
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,040
That's right.

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,860
Let's watch Ryotsu not to do anything rude to Mr. Tsukuda.

170
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
The investigation team has been here for a long time.

171
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
Despite the full-time officer.

172
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah.

173
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,020
So, who are you?

174
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:11,940
Chief.

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,420
Don't lie!

176
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
That idiot.

177
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,300
I was so careful.

178
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,440
I was so careful.

179
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,660
But it's too bad for my heart.

180
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,220
It's a big joke.

181
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
It's not a police family.

182
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,600
It's a cleaning family.

183
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,500
Good job.

184
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,940
Yamada, a sheet of the sheet.

185
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,680
I'm old, but I'm young.

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm younger than the chief and the police.

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,040
I think so.

188
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,160
Lucky, a new store.

189
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,260
We'll take care of you when it opens.

190
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,440
When it opens, we'll serve you.

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,860
Let's go.

192
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,580
What?

193
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,600
Ohara, he's always like that.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,740
Well, sometimes.

195
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,820
Welcome.

196
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,980
The most relaxing pachinko.

197
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,400
It's a big hit.

198
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,140
It's heavy.

199
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,260
Mr. Ryotsu.

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,860
What?

201
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,440
Pachinko is bad during patrol.

202
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,620
This is also part of the patrol.

203
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,380
It's my treat.

204
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,900
You do it, too.

205
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
Well, one.

206
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,980
You're a bad guy.

207
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,800
Let me hold you a little.

208
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,980
Mr. Ryotsu.

209
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,580
Stop it.

210
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,860
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,160
This is my treat.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,540
I put a cigarette in the toilet.

214
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,860
Look.

215
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm here because of this.

216
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,860
You keep shooting.

217
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,840
It's a lie.

218
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,220
I was sitting in this seat at the same time as the store opened.

219
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,640
I just put this here.

220
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,740
You're old.

221
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,600
It's old to put such a dirty thing now.

222
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,820
Shut up.

223
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,640
You remember?

224
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,360
I'll forget it.

225
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,300
It's a big hit.

226
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
It's a big hit.

227
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
Come on.

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,700
What's going on, Mr. Tsukudano?

229
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,680
Mr. Tsukudano.

230
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,240
What?

231
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,700
You're a big hit.

232
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,400
Try to let me borrow it.

233
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll do it later.

234
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,480
Really?

235
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,920
You did it.

236
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,900
You're a big hit.

237
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,220
It's a big hit.

238
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,300
I did it for the first time.

239
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,460
I didn't think it would be so fun.

240
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,520
You.

241
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,800
That's why you're a 10,000-year-old patrol.

242
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,480
I don't understand the people's feelings, so I thought the police officer would be in charge.

243
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,000
I see.

244
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,500
Ryozu is preaching.

245
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,200
It's a good thing that you don't know much about it.

246
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,940
By the way, what's going on with your family structure?

247
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,500
What's wrong?

248
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,180
No, I thought a father like you would be strict with his daughter.

249
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,880
Finally, the honor guard has been cut off.

250
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,620
What's wrong, old man Tsukudana?

251
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,580
Nothing.

252
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,540
I slipped my hand a little.

253
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,100
Now, let's continue the patrol.

254
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,120
I think you should write down your address.

255
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm going to go.

256
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,660
This photo book series is on sale today.

257
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,700
Pichi Pichi Onee-san.

258
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,400
Steamed egg?

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,520
I'm going to wear a uniform.

260
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,220
Isn't it bad to buy a steamed egg?

261
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,840
That idiot!

262
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,520
Well, the photo book section is...

263
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,960
Wait, high school student.

264
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,300
If you go out of this bookstore as it is, it is a crime.

265
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,340
Old man Tsukudana.

267
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,000
Please return this to the sales area.

268
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,680
Huh?

269
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,160
Yes.

270
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,140
Oh, no, that...

271
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,380
Ohara-kun, I'm going.

272
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,760
No, that...

273
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,380
Please take the bill.

274
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,500
That...

275
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,480
You're not taking it to the workshop, are you?

276
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,020
It's like the first half.

277
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,200
He's reflecting on it, so there's no need for it.

278
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Then where are you going?

279
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,420
My room of Nico Nico Ryo.

280
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,320
My room of Nico Nico Ryo.

281
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,700
Huh?

282
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,340
It's a dump.

283
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,120
Start cleaning!

284
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,020
Start cleaning!

285
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,080
Put the field.

286
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes, the vacuum cleaner.

287
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,100
Yes, good.

288
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,460
Yes, it's neat up to the sink.

289
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,680
Yes, it's neat up to the sink.

290
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,040
Come on, come on.

291
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,680
More spirit.

292
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,060
Do it.

293
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,340
Yes, good.

294
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,720
That's it.

295
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,180
Yes, that's it.

296
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,120
Well done.

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Well done.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
So, can I go home now?

299
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,900
Wait a minute.

300
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,740
All right.

301
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,020
All right.

302
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,240
That's it.

303
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,020
What?

304
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,640
Wow, nice.

305
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,680
Wow, nice.

306
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:08,980
Wow, wow, perfect!

307
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,180
I'll do it all.

308
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,000
And it's not like it's going to be polite again.

309
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,540
And it's not like it's going to be polite again.

310
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,060
You're going to need to stuff the hair shop in order.

311
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,280
You're going to need to stuff the hair shop in order.

312
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,120
Don't stack your bags again.

313
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,260
You guys need to go home.

314
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,420
Okay.

315
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,460
Well, I'll go.

316
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,620
What a fine work.

317
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,720
They remodeled it.

318
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,340
Well, they remodeled it.

319
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
No issue of room cleaning

320
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,000
Or the failure of the photographed room.

321
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,800
Or the failure of the photographed room.

322
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,420
No issue of room cleaning

323
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,000

Old man Tsukuda, shoot!

344
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
You've never arrested a criminal before, so you're a year-round criminal.

345
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,560
I'll make you a good old man.

346
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,280
Hey, shoot!

347
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,640
Ah, then I'll be on your side.

348
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,900
Take this!

349
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,140
Take this!

350
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
I hit you!

351
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,880
Get out of the way! I'll get you!

352
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:53,040
Mr. Tsukuda, you're pretty good, aren't you?

353
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,800
Yes, I am.

354
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,740
I've only been playing judo for a long time, so I'm a bit of a black belt.

355
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,060
Old man, you're pretty good, aren't you?

356
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,880
I'll leave the rest to you!

357
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,560
Yes, when you're done, I'll be right back at the station.

358
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,560
Ah, I'll be waiting!

359
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,560
I'm a little hungry.

360
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,920
I'll write some ramen and go home.

361
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,340
Hm? What is it? A letter?

362
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,880
Oh, it's from Tsukuda.

363
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,560
I wonder if he dropped it.

364
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,340
Oh, I knew it.

365
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,940
Oh, you have a daughter?

366
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,760
What, what?

367
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
"How are you, Dad, Mom?"

368
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,000
Five years have passed since I left home after pushing the other side of the fence.

369
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,040
But please allow me to write this letter now.

370
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,900
At the time, Mr. Akira was as old as a burnt-out, as my father said.

371
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,060
But now he's fully recovered.

372
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,780
Last month, he was a member of the Katsushika Family, and he was a member of the Katsushika Family.

373
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,960
It is true that the Katsushika Family has opened a ramen specialty store.

374
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,420
Please come visit and eat the ramen my father and my mother made once.

375
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
Uh, is this address the station?

376
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,660
Ryouto!

377
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,720
What's the matter, both of you?

378
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,720
You're all dressed up like former police officers!

379
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,420
That doesn't matter.

380
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,860
What about the Honorary Inspector?

381
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,660
Honorary Inspector? Who is that?

382
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,640
Oh, Mr. Tsukuda.

383
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,700
That person is as great as the Inspector General.

384
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,180
Eh? Was that man such a great man?

385
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,700
But why is such a great person working at the station?

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,740
Hey, I don't have time to explain to you! Where did you hide it?

387
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,560
I arrested the gangsters, so I made them work together.

388
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,180
If you're that great of an old man...

389
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,720
I'm not an old man! Call me the honorary officer Tsukuda!

390
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,340
I see, you're back in the office.

391
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,360
Anyway, Director, please look at this.

392
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,720
Huh? What is it?

393
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,820
What's that?

394
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,200
I didn't know the honorary officer's daughter was being arrested.

395
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,760
Now the mystery has been solved, right, Director?

396
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,180
Oh, it's solved.

397
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,080
The mystery?

398
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,380
There are a lot of police stations and police stations in the city,

399
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,900
but why did you choose Kameari Park?

400
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,800
I guess I wanted to see how your daughter was doing.

401
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,500
Oh, I want to do something about it.

402
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,700
Yeah, I want to do something about it.

403
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,920
Well, if you say so, I'll do it.

404
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,720
You're not honest, you bastard.

405
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,340
You idiot!

406
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,040
Do you know how it feels to have a daughter like you?

407
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,180
Mr. Oharu, let's go to that ramen shop for now.

408
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,640
That's right, I'll rely on the address on the postcard.

409
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,540
Hey, I'll show you around.

410
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,180
There it is.

411
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,900
Oh, it's pretty popular.

412
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,100
A Tokyo ramen specialty store...

413
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,240
Well, I'll take my clothes off.

414
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,100
Do you have any good suggestions?

415
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,800
I do!

416
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,980
Leave it to me!

417
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,560
3 days later

418
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,360
Thanks for sending me this.

419
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,400
Hey, Mr. Ohara!

420
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,660
I don't know what your taste is,

421
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,060
but just keep your word!

422
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,040
Shut up!

423
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,140
Both of you, keep your mouth shut!

424
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,320
What did you say, Mr. Ohara?

425
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,560
You're the one who's talkative the most!

426
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,080
What's wrong with all three of you?

427
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,980
What do you think, Mr. Tsukuda?

428
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,920
Has it gotten any better here?

429
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,460
I'm here. Listen, I'm going to eat ramen.

430
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,180
I said I want Tokyo ramen with a refreshing taste, but they came.

431
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
Ramen is Sapporo ramen with miso flavor.

432
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,080
It's Hakata ramen with a rich tonkotsu soup.

433
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,500
What? Did you argue over that?

434
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,720
What ramen do you like?

435
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm from the Edo, so I like Tokyo ramen.

436
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,720
That's right. I'll choose Tokyo ramen.

437
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,200
I know a good restaurant, so I'll treat you four.

438
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,140
Nice. I'll treat you.

439
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,100
Let's eat.

440
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
Four people, please come to the counter.

441
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,440
Yes.

442
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,740
Mr. Koshito, please sit here.

443
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,000
Thank you for coming.

444
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,440
There are only two menus.

445
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,340
You have a lot of confidence in taste.

446
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,180
Four ramen and beer.

447
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,100
Beer is not good.

448
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Four ramen and beer.

449
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,420
It's wonderful.

450
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,440
I've been practicing for ten years.

451
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,940
I still have to run for five years.

452
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,120
Thank you for waiting.

453
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,980
It's delicious.

454
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,020
It's a good soup.

455
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,320
The noodles are delicious with the soup.

456
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,520
Thank you.

457
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,320
The restaurant is good.

458
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,560
The children will be happy.

459
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,800
Of course.

460
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,380
Of course you are right.

461
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,880
Maybe.

462
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,280
I'm back.

463
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:56,580
You're alright?

464
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,860
Minori!

465
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,240
Dad?

466
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,840
What?

467
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,240
Thank you.

468
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,240
Please come to see me.

469
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,780
No, it's not like that. They just followed me because they wanted to eat ramen.

470
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,780
Don't be so stubborn, old man Tsukuda.

471
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,280
No matter how moved you are, where are the parents who don't want to see their daughter alone?

472
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,060
Is that so?

473
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,460
The fight at the end was a play to bring me here, wasn't it?

474
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,540
That's...

475
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,300
I was put on the mouth of Ryotsu without running.

476
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
I picked this up.

477
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,520
When the old man threw the robber away, he fell.

478
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,560
Then I thought it was bad, but I read it.

479
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,400
Wait, father!

480
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,640
Listen to Minori.

481
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,320
It's true that Akira-san was bad.

482
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,420
But for the last five years, I've been trying hard to sleep.

483
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,700
Finally...

484
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,200
I managed to make ramen that makes you accept the two of us.

485
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,160
So I tried my best.

486
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,560
I wrote a letter to my father and mother.

487
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,540
I wanted them to see us now.

488
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,320
I wanted them to eat ramen.

489
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,480
I wanted them to forgive the two of us.

490
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,720
Minori...

491
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,460
Father, Minori never says a word about her father and mother for a day.

492
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,520
Please accept the two of us again.

493
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,420
You!

494
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Do you know how much I was worried about my wife to take care of my daughter?

495
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,440
I'm sorry.

496
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,500
Father, I'm sorry.

497
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,400
One more thing.

498
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,040
Don't call my daughter's name anymore.

499
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,620
Yes, sir.

500
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,120
I understand.

501
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,380
My daughter?

502
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,260
Then Kando said...

503
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,520
That's what I said.

504
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,680
I said I'd accept the two of you.

505
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,660
Thank you, father.

506
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,640
Ryotsu, let's go home.

507
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,300
Yes, yes.

508
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Director Kanji, please.

509
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,840
I'll come by every night, so I'll give you a service.

510
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,420
Thank you very much.

511
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,080
You did a good job.

512
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,960
See you later.

513
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,140
He's a tough guy.

514
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
But I understand how your father feels, Minori.

515
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,060
Son...

516
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,320
Don't be like this, Akira.

517
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,200
You can be Minori as you have always been.

518
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,060
But be careful in front of your father for a while.

519
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,120
That's right.

520
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,280
I'll use you separately.

521
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,140
Huh?

522
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,760
My father left it behind?

523
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,920
When did he...

524
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,120
It's a check for the savings.

525
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,120
Huh?

526
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,680
I've been eating it since my mother gave birth to you.

527
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,120
Use it well.

528
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,700
Next time, I'll come to eat with you.

529
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,340
You're so...

530
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,860
You're so...

531
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,580
Dad!

532
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,840
Mom!

533
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,100
Thank you!

534
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:54,780
Thank you!

535
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,520
Thank you!

536
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,960
Thank you!

537
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,060
Thank you!

538
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,140
Thank you!

539
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,080
Thanks to everyone, it was a wonderful day.

540
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,540
Thank you so much.

541
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,340
Thank you so much.

542
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,320
I'm glad you met the young lady.

543
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,520
Well then, let's go to the Tsukuda Honor Guard.

544
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,900
Yeah.

545
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,320
Ohara-kun.

546
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,360
You're happy to have a wonderful subordinate like Ryotsu-kun, aren't you?

547
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,840
No, no, I'm going to say it again.

548
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,420
The Honor Guard is only here for a day, so I don't know if you're misunderstanding his essence.

549
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,760
Why?

550
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,280
Why?

551
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,720
You're being praised by your subordinate.

552
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,640
You have to be honestly happy.

553
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,360
I have to be happy, sir.

554
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,520
Please, take care.

555
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
Please come to play sometimes.

556
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,280
Old man Tsukuda, I'm going to be bored from tomorrow.

557
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,840
Let's play pachinko again.

558
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,780
I'll be with you anytime.

559
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,520
If you want, I can teach you anything.

560
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,680
Idiot!

561
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,860
What are you saying to the Honor Guard?

562
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,120
Hey!

563
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,960
Please stop, sir.

564
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,900
I'm a great subordinate of Ohara-buchou.

565
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,740
Ohara-buchou

566
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,880
Ohara-buchou

567
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,800
Someone's calling me, on a rainy day.

568
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,080
Looking back, I walked.

569
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,020
Mom, put your hands on me.

570
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:34,160
I felt strange feelings at that time

571
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,880
That's why I walked only in black

572
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,820
on the Ake-do-gai's tile

573
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:53,520
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgets

574
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,000
I was a child once, but everyone forgets

575
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,820
I was a child once, but everyone forgets

576
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,000
Turn that corner

577
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,240
Turn that corner

578
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,660
And see everyone

579
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,380
There's a wall there

580
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,340
There definitely is a wall

581
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,360
Let's go to our town

582
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,440
Thank you!

583
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,740
Next time

584
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,780
I can't believe that my eyebrows and hair are so smooth!

585
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,280
Oh well, I'll draw them with magic.

586
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,380
Huh? What kind of eyebrows do I have?

587
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,980
Huh? Huh? Huh?

588
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,040
Next time on Tsurupika Ryo-san

589
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Not good!

590
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,460
Please subscribe to our channel!

591
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
