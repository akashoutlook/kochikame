21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you!

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,940
Do your life again!

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,740
Don't run away!

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
Go! Go!

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,420
Leave it to me!

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,300
Bastard!

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,180
Honga! Don't lose!

28
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,340
Don't underestimate the police!

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,420
I'll arrest you!

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,920
Bastard!

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,960
What are you thinking?

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,360
Ohara is trying to disown you

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,020
What should I say?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,700
Excuse me

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,060
Today's lecture was a little long, wasn't it?

36
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,560
Without you

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
My life would be a lot different

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,020
Yeah, it was hard

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,120
I was about to be fired

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,440
Oh, my God

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,180
Well, it doesn't matter what happens

42
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,800
It doesn't start

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Life has to be positive

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,780
Ha ha ha

45
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,280
How bad are you?

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,420
Well, I'll shoot you!

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,480
Oh, a knock-out board

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,060
Senior, I did it!

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,180
Your favorite masterpiece!

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,940
What? Really?

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,140
This one!

52
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,120
Yes!

53
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,060
This is the revolution of PC games!

54
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,360
Ryoji, what are you talking about?

55
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,600
It's a revolutionary PC game developed by a company in Nakagawa

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,820
It's not like you used to raise a girl or a pet

57
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,740
This is a game to raise yourself

58
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,540
Raise myself?

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,160
What does it mean?

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,260
In other words, input all the data of the person himself

61
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,140
and make it into a game character.

62
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,780
That way, the person's future can be simulated on a computer.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,700
There's a lot of side characters, and it's hard to understand.

64
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,580
So it's a life game on a computer, right?

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,600
That also means that you can understand the future that's very close to reality.

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,200
I don't even know what to say to the manager. Let's actually try it.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Let's do it.

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,940
This game already has all of the data of the senior as a sample.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
When you start the game, the main character will appear.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,520
Oh, it's exactly like Ryotsu.

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
Exactly. This is me.

72
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,960
What?

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
For example, let's say you dropped money in front of the senior.

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,200
Then...

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,060
I closed it! I lost 5,000 yen!

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,860
Lucky!

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,080
Hey!

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,500
The police officer is also there.

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,000
The police officer is also there.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
Do you think you can conquer the secret?

81
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
No way! Calm down!

82
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,720
This is a game! A game!

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,300
Oh, I see.

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,680
Damn it.

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,520
Hey, what's this number?

86
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,080
It's the current happiness, assets, and position numbers.

87
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,920
I picked up 5,000 yen, so the assets are 5,000.

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,240
Happiness is 10.

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,840
I see. The position hasn't changed.

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,440
There's a continuation.

91
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,660
Oh, the manager is here.

92
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,300
Oh, Ryotsu.

93
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,280
Ryotsu, what were you doing here?

94
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,280
M- Manager! No, nothing.

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,980
Nothing is wrong.

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,760
It's a nice day today.

97
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,360
The excuse is exactly the same as Ryotsu.

98
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
Because they have the same personality.

99
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,760
I saw it, Ryotsu!

100
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,180
Do you think a policeman can conquer a secret?

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,940
M- Manager, calm down!

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,340
The lines are the same.

103
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,220
Really?

104
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll take care of this.

105
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,340
Oh, my God!

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, damn it.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,020
The happiness and assets are back to zero.

108
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Of course.

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,860
I'll marry a rich girl and increase all the numbers.

110
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,120
No, I have my own.

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
Speaking of rich girls, Reiko.

112
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,880
Oh, my God!

113
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,200
What are you doing?

114
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,980
You want to be rich, right?

115
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,480
Oh, my God!

116
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,420
These numbers increase so quickly.

117
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,540
I have to do this.

118
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,360
In a month?

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,580
That's impossible.

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,860
The company started with a copy of my wife's unique work has gone bankrupt.

121
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,780
Gah, what the hell!

122
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,720
Then it is a comeback as a policeman!

123
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,340
I have no idea.

124
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't know.

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,140
What?!

126
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
Ah! The police are being arrested!

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,900
Hahaha! This is good!

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
Even though it's a game, the burden is greatly reduced!

129
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Hahaha!

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,700
Ah, look at this!

131
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,000
He's starting a bank robbery!

132
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,720
Give me the money!

133
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,020
Hey! What are you doing?!

134
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,300
Even if you say that, the character is moving on its own!

135
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,840
Oh! He stole 3.3 billion yen!

136
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
You idiot!

137
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:08,920
Ouch!

138
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,900
Ah! I won't work for the rest of my life!

139
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,020
Hahaha!

140
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,540
What a guy!

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
He seems to have completely tasted it.

142
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,000
Ryotsu! Be quiet and confess!

143
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,640
I don't want to!

144
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,180
Hey! Are you waiting, Ryotsu?!

145
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,140
The chief's persuasion is still not enough.

146
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,240
How cheeky! Don't make the game and reality together!

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,940
Ah, look! This time he has a gun!

148
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,560
He's going to attack a cashier.

149
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,760
Give me the money!

150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
Ah!

151
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,960
Ah! I was shot!

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
In 2005, the law changed and the defense was strengthened.

153
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,080
Don't predict it on your own!

154
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,820
It's game over.

155
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,980
Hahaha! This is quite interesting!

156
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,840
Nakagawa-kun, you're doing well!

157
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm sorry!

158
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,500
Don't do this!

159
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm the only one who's too pathetic!

160
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,440
Everyone, join us!

161
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,700
It's okay. The data is perfect.

162
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,200
Me too?

163
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,800
Me too?

164
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,740
Me too?

165
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,740
That's right. And everyone starts at the age of three.

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,700
But the era of birth is different.

167
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,680
It's okay because it's linked properly.

168
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,880
Wow, cute!

169
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,500
Hey, Ryo-san.

170
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,960
I wonder if you could start at a different time than now.

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,800
If you don't, it's boring to see my future.

172
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,820
I see. You're right.

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Alright, I'll start as a rich old lady.

174
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,880
And then, I'll start as a poor person.

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,460
Eh? Why?

176
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll let you guys experience the pain of growing up from the bottom.

177
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
Then, I'll start.

178
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,040
Start!

179
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
I don't know where my home is.

180
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
You're going to get lost in your own garden?

181
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm not used to it.

182
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,400
Papa! Papa!

183
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,440
He's out of the house.

184
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,420
What?

185
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,740
What's going to happen to me?

186
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,760
What?

187
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,160
It seems that he was picked up by a kind person.

188
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,040
And when he grows up, he becomes a police officer.

189
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,940
He's an ordinary man, but he's living a happy family life.

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,460
What? You're still the same as you are now.

191
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,340
Well, I guess I'm just like this.

192
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,420
I've made you live in a rich family.

193
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,500
Alright, next is Reiko.

194
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,900
Oh, you're three years old, Reiko.

195
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,320
Wow, I'm poor for what I'm wearing, but you're so cute.

196
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,020
No matter how cute you are, you're so poor.

197
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,660
Wow, great!

198
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,100
This is the ideal girl I've been looking for.

199
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,100
Hey, you, would you like to appear in a movie with me?

200
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,060
Mama!

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,720
You're a beautiful girl, but you're a debut as a child actor because you got caught in the eyes of a movie director.

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,400
That movie was a huge hit by chance.

203
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,740
Reiko is a national star.

204
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,540
Hey, hey!

205
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,820
And she's also a world-class star in Hollywood.

206
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,580
After that, she was liked by the US President.

207
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,540
And she's going to be the secretary of the White House.

208
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,860
This is even more amazing than it is now.

209
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,000
You're so talented and talented.

210
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,200
No way.

211
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,320
Damn it.

212
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
Alright, then I'll make you more and more hyper ultra special poor.

213
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,440
It's from where you're living in a pipe.

214
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
Isn't it a little too cruel?

215
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,240
This is enough because reality is too blessed.

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,380
Oh, a roll of money.

217
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,920
Oh, where's Amuko?

218
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,400
Wait a minute!

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,260
I'll go.

220
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,160
I'll make sure no one comes.

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,000
No one can get close to this.

222
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,120
That's terrible.

223
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, construction has begun.

224
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,060
Hey, you.

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,860
Yes, president.

226
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,780
That girl.

227
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,720
Hey!

228
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,520
Can you forgive such a convenient thing?

229
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,340
All right, it starts from the point where you're drifting in the sea.

230
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,580
You, that girl.

231
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Why do you always do that?

232
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,660
Why do you always find such rich people?

233
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,100
Oh, yeah.

234
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,180
It seems that no matter what the setting is, Nakagawa is destined to be rich.

235
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,600
You were born under the star of luck.

236
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
Even I'm afraid of her.

237
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Hmph.

238
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,040
Not funny.

239
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
Then the next is the head of the club.

240
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,580
You idiot!

241
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,420
What on earth are you doing?

242
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Mr. Tonda.

243
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Ohara.

244
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,300
Mr. Ohara?

245
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,220
What do you mean?

246
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,240
I see. The game is still running as Senpai said it was.

247
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,460
What?

248
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,360
What?

249
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,260
If he's not here, am I the president?

250
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,700
That's what I think.

251
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,520
I want to see more. Show me the rest.

252
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,380
Okay.

253
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,720
Wow! He's even working as a police officer!

254
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,200
What?

255
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,080
What do you think, Ryo-tsu?

256
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,620
My ability is just like yours.

257
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,740
Who said don't play games and reality together?

258
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,640
Idiot!

259
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,760
It's proof that your life has changed because of you!

260
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,580
You pervert!

261
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,640
No! Don't say I'm a pervert!

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,960
Then, what will happen to me without Senpai?

263
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,620
That's right. I'll show you, Ryo-tsu.

264
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,780
I'm going to the head office of the traffic department.

265
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,880
Really?

266
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,020
It's a great deal to meet you, Ryo-tsu.

267
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,500
Senpai, you're so mean! You're a pervert!

268
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,720
No way! I'll say whatever I want!

269
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,900
Then, let's see other people.

270
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,960
How about Sakonji?

271
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,520
No!

272
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,820
After winning gold medals at the Olympics, he was a great player in the K-1.

273
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,840
He never got into the game.

274
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,500
It's a life of bickering.

275
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,420
You devil!

276
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,840
Ouch! What are you going to do, President?

277
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,180
I'm not asking what I'll do.

278
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,520
Everyone is unhappy because I just met you.

279
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,460
It's just a game simulation.

280
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,060
But it's like reality. Take responsibility!

281
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,740
That's nonsense!

282
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,100
Then, how about you try it if you met Senpai before?

283
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
I agree.

284
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,240
It may not be just Senpai.

285
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Then, what about you, Komachi?

286
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,320
Let's try it.

287
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,200
I met a senior who was a junior in my neighborhood when he was 3 years old.

288
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,120
After that, I married him because I had no other partner.

289
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,440
I built a building by destroying the lawn of my house, but it failed.

290
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,060
I have no place to live because of debt.

291
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,460
No way!

292
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,140
Look, Ryozu, it's all your fault.

293
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,680
It's not like that.

294
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,000
There may be some people who have become unhappy even if they don't meet me.

295
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,320
Then let's look at the others.

296
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,820
Then, what is the model of Ozaki?

297
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,020
He is the president of a large gang chain.

298
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,040
Then, what about Ryo's aunt?

299
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,780
She won the All Japan Ryo-bo-san Contest.

300
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,560
No way! What about my father?

301
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,840
Ryozuya is a big company and is the president of Asakusa Shopping Association.

302
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,600
Then, what about that dog?

303
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,740
It was picked up by a rich man and sold for a lot of money.

304
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,100
Don't say that.

305
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,620
Then, what about the bride?

306
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,160
What if I don't meet a bride?

307
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,200
Are you a bride?

308
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,700
Look at this.

309
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,260
The bride is the same as before.

310
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,380
But look at this happiness.

311
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,220
It's 62% from 60%.

312
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,540
It's 2% up.

313
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,980
It's all my fault.

314
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,740
It's not like that.

315
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Maria.

316
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,640
Please.

317
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,380
If I were a real woman, I would be with Ryo.

318
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,180
What's going on with her?

319
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,920
What's happening with her?

320
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,820
Then, I'll go.

321
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,200
I'll be in your care.

322
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
We got married for free.

323
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,580
It's love.

324
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,820
That's right.

325
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,280
Happiness is increasing.

326
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,100
Thanks to Maria, we arrested the culprit of the important international mission.

327
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,280
We even got a 300 million yen lottery.

328
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,480
We even got a prize.

329
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,640
We even went to the police department.

330
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
Everything is going well.

331
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,480
Besides, thanks to Maria,

332
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,980
we won't be a nuisance to the people around us.

333
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,880
There's nothing good.

334
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,820
Maria is happy.

335
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,900
Ryo.

336
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
How about you marry Maria?

337
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,500
That's a good idea.

338
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,980
That's right, Ryo.

339
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,140
That's great.

340
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,940
Ryo.

341
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's get married soon.

342
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,240
That's right.

343
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,260
What?

344
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,520
You can't do that.

345
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,140
Because you are...

346
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,320
Because you are a man.

347
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,060
Yes.

348
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,840
That's right.

349
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,100
It's a good thing.

350
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,720
That's right, Ryo.

351
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,540
It's for everyone.

352
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,700
Congratulations.

353
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,160
Maria.

354
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,660
Maria.

355
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,340
Congratulations.

356
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,180
I'm glad you're here.

357
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,020
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,100
I'm glad you're here.

359
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm glad you're here.

360
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,920
I'm glad you're here.

361
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,580
I'm glad you're here.

362
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,880
I'm glad you're here.

363
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,340
we don't want to get married.

364
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,340
Help us.

365
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Wait, Ryo.

366
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,240
Let's build a happy family with me.

367
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,460
No, stop.

368
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,480
Let's stop this alliance.

369
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,940
Let's move on.

370
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,260
Next story!

371
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,240
Next story!

372
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,080
The man with the seven-colored voice

373
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,560
Senpai, what's wrong?

374
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,660
A terrible growling voice. Did you catch a cold?

375
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,900
No, I went to karaoke last night and sang for 12 hours, and my throat was cold.

376
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,220
12 hours?

377
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,020
That's crazy.

378
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,080
But it's a great voice. It's like listening to a old song.

379
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,560
I was surprised when I woke up in the morning.

380
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,200
Are you okay? Senpai?

381
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,880
What's this?

382
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,000
Ryo-san seems to have a lot of damage.

383
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,880
He was just a normal human.

384
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,520
Of course.

385
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,140
Ryo-san, what's that voice?

386
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,080
What's wrong?

387
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,180
It's just like Chief Ohara.

388
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,860
That's creepy.

389
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,040
Is it that similar to the voice of the chief?

390
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,300
Anyone can hear that voice.

391
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,540
Good morning, everyone.

392
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,240
What a coincidence.

393
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,780
It's true.

394
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,400
Yes, this is the Parkway Exhibition Office.

395
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,220
Chief, Chief Ohara hasn't come yet, but...

396
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,260
Give me a minute.

397
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,500
Hello, it's me, Ohara.

398
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,980
That voice is the chief.

399
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,580
What do you want me to do?

400
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,820
Ohara, what's with that attitude?

401
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,040
If you have a problem, come here, you stupid chief.

402
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,600
I don't forget, I'm the type to take care of things.

403
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,940
Oh, good.

404
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,700
I'm Ohara.

405
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,640
That's terrible.

406
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,420
What?

407
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,000
You don't care?

408
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
All right, I'll run around with the chief's voice.

409
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,200
Senior.

410
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,780
I don't know.

411
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,860
Here, morning sushi.

412
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,300
Chief Ohara.

413
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,380
Yes, it's Ohara.

414
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,460
Ten special sushi, please.

415
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,860
Please.

416
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,120
I'm on a big call.

417
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,220
Yes, sir.

418
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh, this is Chief Ohara.

419
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,440
Excuse me, but please send the plamodel of the Radicon helicopter and the battleship Yamato

420
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,360
and the combat-like figure set to Ryo's place.

421
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,540
Of course, I will pay the full loan.

422
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,280
Why?

423
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
That is a reward for the daily work of Ryo's chief.

424
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,920
Stop it, Ryo.

425
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,940
That's right, senpai.

426
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,900
Shut up.

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,140
You're going to get a lot of grudges.

428
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,280
Alright, I'll call the police next time.

429
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,780
Look, Ryo-san.

430
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,660
I'm going to do something bad.

431
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,280
Shut up!

432
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,560
Ah!

433
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,260
His voice changed again.

434
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,840
This time, it's the president's voice.

435
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,860
Huh?

436
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,860
What did you say?

437
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
It's true.

438
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,240
That's strange.

439
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,760
What's going on?

440
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,260
I...

441
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
I got a stomach ache from suffering.

442
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,100
Ah...

443
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,620
Ah...

444
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,340
It hurts.

445
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,980
It's obvious.

446
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,500
If you tighten your neck, you'll die.

447
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,760
I don't know that much.

448
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,580
Ah, it changed again.

449
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,740
His voice got louder.

450
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,700
What?

451
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,080
I see.

452
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,500
I know how to do it.

453
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
How's that?

454
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,980
Your voice got louder again, right?

455
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,760
It's true.

456
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,380
When you touch this part of your throat, it changes.

457
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,740
When you lower one finger...

458
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,120
Ah.

459
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,580
When you lower one octave, it changes.

460
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,900
It gets louder.

461
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,540
And you can adjust your voice with the balance of left and right.

462
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,020
That's amazing.

463
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,700
He has a seven-colored voice.

464
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,660
All right.

465
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,140
If I do this...

466
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,000
Ah.

467
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,900
I bought a new Ferrari.

468
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm sick of it, so I'll give it to you.

469
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,000
How's that?

470
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,480
It's like Kei-chan.

471
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,980
You can do good things.

472
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,040
And if I do this...

473
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,340
Ah.

474
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,060
Oh, it's like Ryo-chan.

475
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,260
He's a manly and popular idol.

476
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,660
Ah, it's Reiko-san.

477
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,680
I don't like it.

478
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,900
Next.

479
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm a life-saving band member.

480
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,400
It's Terai-san.

481
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,280
Am I that kind of voice like Hayashi or Kobuhei?

482
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,700
And...

483
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,920
Hey, hey, it's Gouki's Honda.

484
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
I'm going to beat you up.

485
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,500
Hey, Saori.

486
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,980
Help me get out of here.

487
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,260
Ryo-sama.

488
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,480
I'm Maria.

489
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,380
I don't know what to say.

490
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,940
Good morning.

491
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,460
Ah, Chief.

492
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,500
Good morning.

493
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,320
Oh, what's wrong, Ryo-san?

494
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,260
What's wrong with you?

495
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,120
Good morning.

496
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,420
Oh, Chief Ohara.

497
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm waiting for ten sushi.

498
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,080
What?

499
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,260
I don't remember asking for that.

500
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,580
What?

501
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,620
But it was definitely the voice of the chief.

502
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,760
Even if you say that, there's nothing I don't remember.

503
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,440
Don't say that.

504
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,580
Well, then...

505
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,740
Chief, I brought a gift for Ryo-san.

506
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,260
What?

507
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,200
Chief, you have a good point.

508
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,640
Don't be silly.

509
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,220
I'm not supposed to do that.

510
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,680
You're getting embarrassed again.

511
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,840
No, no, it's not me.

512
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,440
What?

513
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,000
But on the phone...

514
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,740
Ohara.

515
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:23,860
Ohara?

516
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,820
Chief, this is just the right place.

517
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,120
Something strange has happened.

518
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,280
Ohara.

519
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,500
Huh?

520
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,920
A decision has been made on the end of the sea,

521
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,780
so I decided to ask you to tell me right away.

522
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,360
What?

523
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,000
Chief, why did I have to go to the end of the sea?

524
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,040
I said that on the phone.

525
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,940
On the phone?

526
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,440
What did you say?

527
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,200
Ryo-chan.

528
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,540
Ryo-san.

529
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,620
Do you know something?

530
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Ryo-san, did you do it?

531
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,700
No, I didn't do anything.

532
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,180
What?

533
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,280
You sounded like a woman.

534
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,180
I became a man with seven voices.

535
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,360
What?

536
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,420
What do you mean?

537
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,680
Ryo-san, you can't run away like that.

538
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,920
So, this is what happens.

539
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,380
When you do this...

540
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,780
Stop, Nakagawa.

541
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Stop!

542
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,040
That's my voice.

543
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,440
And then, when you do this...

544
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,340
No, you should stop, Nakagawa.

545
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,860
And then, when you do this...

546
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,580
Don't move, you!

547
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,760
I won't leave you alone.

548
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,260
You idiot!

549
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,120
I'll cut your head into pieces!

550
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,820
Like this, Ryo-chan used the seven voices freely.

551
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,100
Please pay ten people for the special sushi.

552
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,100
I'll get the money for the ramen too.

553
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,240
Ryo-chan, are you ready?

554
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,420
You're the one who's going to the end of the sea.

555
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,480
You're the one who's going to the end of the sea!

556
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,040
Please stop, chief!

557
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,520
Shut up, you idiot!

558
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,940
You're so mean!

559
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,040
My eyes are spinning!

560
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,660
I won't forgive you this time!

561
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,820
I'm so happy!

562
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,960
You idiot!

563
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,860
You're the worst!

564
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,220
That's my voice!

565
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't know what's going on!

566
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,540
Nachi!

567
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,240
Help me again!

568
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,800
You idiot!

569
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,280
You piece of shit!

570
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,500
You little black grunge!

571
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,900
Shut up!

572
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,880
My eyes are spinning.

573
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,420
This can't be happening.

574
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,700
Why are you doing this to me?

575
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,860
Put up your hands.

576
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,280
Shut up, chipmunk!

577
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,280
Shut up, idiot!

578
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,800
And here we are.

585

Why do I keep getting unlucky?

586
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,180
According to the fortune teller, today is the worst day of my life?

587
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,880
I see, if today ends, this misfortune will end.

588
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,140
Next time, "The Worst Day of Life"!

589
