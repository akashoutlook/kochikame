1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,220
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,660
Make the room brighter and stay away

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:21,880
Like someone is calling

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,120
There is a turtle

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,380
There must be a turtle

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,900
There must be a turtle

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,480
Everyone come to our town

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,700
Thank you!

9
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,360
Thank you!

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,120
Thank you!

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,360
Thank you!

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:10,380
Thank you!

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,480
I'll return it to you!

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,980
What does it mean to return it without looking at it?

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,680
In the past, the manager's meeting story

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,700
There was no good woman at all

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,580
I'm fine!

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,560
Idiot!

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,600
I can't do that!

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,820
Listen

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,640
I don't want to see you

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,280
I don't want to see you

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,480
A bad woman may not appear again

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,160
I will refuse

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,080
I have no intention of marriage for the time being

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,380
Besides, marriage is love marriage

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,160
I have decided it in my heart

28
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,680
Do you think there are people who want to marry a man like you?

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Of course

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,200
The manager doesn't know at all

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Even if it looks like this, I'm popular

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,420
Are you popular?

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,380
Stop joking around.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,620
You're dating a woman or something.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,720
I've never heard of this before.

36
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,440
What are you saying?

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,340
I've finally calmed down recently.

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,740
About ten years ago, women were so noisy.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,780
"Ryo-chan, you have to get married to die."

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,480
"I want to have a child like you."

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,620
Who are they?

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
Akemi of the Kinshicho.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
Naomi of Shinkoiwa.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,880
You're the older sister of a bar.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,260
If you're a customer, you should say that to everyone.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
I came with you.

47
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,100
Excuse me, sir.

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,940
May I?

49
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,480
What is it?

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
I have a customer.

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,400
Me?

52
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,400
Dad!

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,760
I missed you.

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,800
Dad...

55
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,780
Dad?

56
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm not joking.

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
I don't know you.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,680
Dad!

59
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,340
Don't stick to me.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm leaving.

61
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,440
Are you okay?

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,100
Ryo-chan, what are you doing to my child?

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,340
Poor thing.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
What are you doing?

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,480
First 94's F-Cup.

66
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,800
Hey, what are you doing?

67
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,000
Let me go.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,160
It hurts.

69
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,940
It hurts.

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,660
What a dirty thing.

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,520
You are dirty.

72
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,680
Let me go.

73
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,140
I won't let you go.

74
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,100
Let go of me.

75
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,860
You're just like Ryo-chan.

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,340
You said that he is a cheat.

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,800
That he is a coward.

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,280
He has two eyebrows.

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,040
And your name is Kankichiro, right?

80
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,140
What?

81
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,320
Kankichiro?

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,900
My mother said that my name comes from my father.

83
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,580
Kankichi?

84
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,060
Kankichiro?

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,800
He may be Ryo's son.

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,100
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be.

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,160
Kankichiro.

88
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,540
Would you like to hear the details?

89
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,920
Can you tell me something?

90
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,820
My mom told me that my dad died when he was a baby.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,660
But my mom died in a car accident a week ago.

92
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Before my mom died, she took my hand and said,

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,820
"I have to tell you something.

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,440
Actually, my dad is still alive."

95
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,700
Was that your father?

96
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,980
"Your dad is a local named Kan-Kichi Ryotsu,

97
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,260
who ran the Kameyari Park Exhibition."

98
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,280
But my mom fell in love with him and gave birth to you.

99
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,360
She said, "He doesn't know anything about you,

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,000
so you shouldn't bother him."

101
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,840
So I didn't want to come to the beginning.

102
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,940
But I wanted to see your dad's face at least once.

103
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,940
So...

104
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,020
So that's why you came to see him.

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,320
Where do you live now?

106
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,100
Is it your relative's house or somewhere else?

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
I don't have any relatives.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,820
I live alone.

109
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,580
You live alone?

110
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,760
Yes.

111
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,960
But I'm not lonely.

112
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,140
I know that my dad is there even if we live apart.

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't agree.

114
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,860
Shut up.

115
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Kan-Kichiro,

116
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,340
your mother's name is Akemi, right?

117
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
Or Naomi?

118
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,160
Naomi.

119
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Now it's decided.

120
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,640
What do you mean?

121
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,420
Kan-Kichiro is your son.

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,600
No way!

123
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,660
It's not like that.

124
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,680
Ten years ago,

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
you said, "I can die if I marry you."

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,600
Or "I want to have your baby."

127
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:11,920
That's what you said.

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,880
No, that's a lie.

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,500
Don't talk nonsense.

130
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,580
Listen, Ryotsu.

131
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,760
Now that you know who your parents are,

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,660
you can't leave your child alone.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,820
From now on,

134
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,300
you're going to raise Kan-Kichiro.

135
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,840
You're kidding.

136
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,140
I don't want to.

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,900
Now, Kan-Kichiro,

138
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
you're going to live with your father.

139
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,680
Really?

140
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,780
Yes.

141
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,940
Dad!

142
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
You little brat!

143
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,140
You little brat!

144
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,760
Dad!

145
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,040
Dad!

146
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,220
Senpai, don't do that!

147
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,660
Dad!

148
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,420
Dad!

149
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,460
Dad!

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,240
You're so mean.

151
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,300
You're so naive.

152
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,660
Dad!

153
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm going to go!

154
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm going to get you!

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,980
Dad is dead!

156
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,560
Dad is dead!

157
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,660
Dad!

158
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,480
-I'm not you kid! -I see.

159
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm very angry, too!

160
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,120
-Are you not going to go? -No, I won't.

161
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,480
Kan-Kichi,

162
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,160
maybe you should understand.

163
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,420
Mom.

164
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,300
You're amazing.

165
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,860
You're so really cute!

166
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,980
Miguel is a wicked, evil man!

167
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,260
Please cooperate with us!

168
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,920
Don't make me a criminal!

169
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,340
Get out of my way!

170
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,000
Damn you!

171
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
Dad...

172
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,220
It's okay, Kankichiro.

173
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,300
I'll help you.

174
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,500
I can't get out of here!

175
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,180
What?

176
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,400
You're not good at pachinko!

177
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,120
Why are you here?

178
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,920
Reiko said she would be here.

179
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,300
Reiko, stop it.

180
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,440
What?

181
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,940
Get out of my way!

182
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,840
I don't want to.

183
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,840
It's my turn.

184
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,700
You think a little kid can play pachinko?

185
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,220
If you're going to stop me, I have to think about it.

186
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,600
What?

187
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,500
I got it.

188
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,580
I'll stop you for a night, so change!

189
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,400
It's 6 o'clock.

190
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,920
Let's go home, everyone.

191
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,320
Everyone.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,520
I didn't think you'd come out like that.

193
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,180
Don't forget that it's all thanks to me, Dad.

195
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,180
Stop calling me Dad.

196
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,860
Call me Ryo.

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,540
Okay, Dad.

198
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,340
So don't call me Dad.

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Ryo!

200
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,580
Maria...

201
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,660
Ryo...

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,300
You made me a criminal while I'm still alive!

203
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,240
Maria...

204
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,920
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,740
Ryo's evil...

206
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:42,980
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,100
Stop it, Maria.

209
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,980
You're not a good mom.

210
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,260
Maria, are you Ryo's girlfriend?

211
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
Then what?

212
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,640
So will you be my mom in the future?

213
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Mom?

214
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,020
Mom...

215
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,560
What a pleasant sound.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
What's wrong?

217
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,700
Ryo's wife is Ryo's wife.

219
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,640
Ryo, who's your daughter?

220
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,240
In that case, my child is the same.

221
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,800
What's your name?

222
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,220
Kanchiro!

223
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,420
Mr. Kanchiro?

224
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,500
I'll be your mother from today!

225
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,300
Really?

226
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,260
I'm so happy to have such a beautiful mother.

227
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,580
I'm so happy too.

228
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,800
We're going to make it work, right?

229
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,620
Yes.

230
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,440
This is because Ryo has a secret word.

231
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,120
Wow! It's amazing!

234
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,760
Then, let's eat!

235
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,780
Let's eat!

236
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,860
Let's eat!

237
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:11,880
Kankichiro, is my dish delicious?

238
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,460
Why are you pushing Maria to eat?

239
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,520
Because we are family from today.

240
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,680
Right?

241
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,900
Father, you should eat with us.

242
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,060
Right?

243
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,080
Father, let's go somewhere together tomorrow.

244
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,840
That's right.

245
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,540
Let's tell your father about Asakusa.

246
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
Kankichiro, let's go somewhere together.

247
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you talking about?

248
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,940
I can't go.

249
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,760
And stop calling me father.

250
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,380
Kankichiro, have you been to Asakusa?

251
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,240
There is a amusement park called Hanayashiki.

252
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,320
Let's take father there.

253
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,360
Yes.

254
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,220
I said I can't go.

255
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,180
The roller coaster over there is very scary.

256
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm looking forward to it.

257
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm looking forward to it.

258
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm looking forward to it.

259
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,220
Thank you, Kankichiro.

260
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,680
It's this time of the year.

261
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,800
Let's show your children's faces at your parents' house.

262
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,300
What are you talking about?

263
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,520
I don't want to go.

264
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,100
Wow.

265
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,580
The lantern is big.

266
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,800
Right?

267
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,140
Father, hurry up.

268
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,260
So, stop calling me father.

269
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,700
Don't pull me.

270
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,320
Father, let's buy this.

271
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,700
Let's buy this.

272
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,100
So, don't call me father.

273
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,880
Hurry up.

274
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,120
Don't pull me.

275
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,600
Hurry up.

276
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,120
Don't let me fall.

277
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,620
Wow.

278
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,040
I don't want to go.

279
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,320
I don't want to go.

280
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,980
I don't want to go.

281
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,500
I don't want to go.

282
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,940
I don't want to go.

283
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
I don't want to go.

284
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,820
Father.

285
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,100
Father.

286
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm persistent.

287
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,480
I don't want to go.

288
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,060
Try it.

289
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,000
Try it.

290
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,400
Great.

291
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,660
I see.

292
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,620
Next, next.

293
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,180
Next.

294
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,320
Ha ha ha ha.

295
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

296
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

297
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,040
Yes.

298
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,520
I don't want to.

299
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,200
First of all, I can't ride a bike.

300
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,100
What? You can't even ride a bike?

301
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,900
You're so generous!

302
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,220
I'll make sure I can ride it.

303
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,020
Really?

304
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,940
Yes. But my teaching is very strict.

305
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
Ryo, you can take as much as you want.

306
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,660
Maria, who the hell are you?

307
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,860
You'll know when you take a bath with me.

308
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,840
Maria, Kandichiro wants to take a bath with you tonight.

309
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,960
Sure!

310
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,860
Hey!

311
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,880
Kandichiro, how's the water temperature?

312
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,200
It's just right.

313
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,700
My dear daughter,

314
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,280
I'll give you a share if you don't want to go to bed.

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:42,140
I don't want to go to bed at night.

316
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,240
Dad is...

317
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,620
You can do anything. You know I'm going to fall in love with you, right?

318
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,180
Alright! This should do it.

319
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
Wow! It's like a new product!

320
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,380
Then let's do some special training.

321
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:05,000
Listen. The pedals are fine, so balance with the steering wheel.

322
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,220
Don't let it fall and run all the way down.

323
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,780
No way!

324
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,680
Don't be like that! Normally, you would hold your back in a park and ride more and more.

325
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,360
Don't be so cheeky!

326
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,040
What you need to be able to ride a bike is balance and courage!

327
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,700
That's it!

328
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,160
I knew it!

329
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
Do it!

330
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Do it!

331
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,900
Do it!

332
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,820
Do it!

333
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,660
Do it again!

334
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,640
Do it again!

335
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,420
Do it again!

336
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,840
I did it!

337
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,340
Now! Burn the pedals!

338
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,700
Y-Yes!

339
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,600
I did it!

340
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,120
I did it!

341
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,480
I did it!

342
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,180
I did it!

343
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,300
Are you okay?

344
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,220
Dad, look! I did it!

345
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,140
Yeah.

346
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:24,860
Here.

347
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,960
Here.

348
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,940
Well, let's go home.

349
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,100
Yeah, let's go.

350
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,960
Yeah.

351
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,640
It's going to take a while.

352
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:38,840
We're all hungry!

353
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,940
Yeah.

354
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:56,780
How much were you tired?

355
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,820
Yeah.

356
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,280
Ryo-sama.

357
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,300
Kids are cute, aren't they?

358
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,880
Mm?

359
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,280
Huh?

360
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
It might not be so bad to have a child.

361
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,560
Huh?

362
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,180
I'm just kidding. Good night.

363
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,040
No. You do it like this.

364
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,220
Oh, I see. Like this.

365
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,720
Yeah.

366
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,100
Ryo-chan, you're a pretty good father, aren't you?

367
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,380
Yes.

368
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,960
I guess so.

369
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,960
Hey!

370
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Isn't this a request for search?

371
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,000
What's wrong with this?

372
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,800
He was lying.

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,960
Your parents will be coming soon.

374
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,780
I've already fought with Ryo-sama.

375
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,460
What should I tell Ryo-sama?

376
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,860
I've brought Hayato's parents.

377
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,480
What do you think about this trip?

378
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Thank you for helping me.

379
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,620
No, that's...

380
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,360
Hold on tight.

381
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,360
Hayato!

382
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,100
Hey, Hayato! You're worrying me!

383
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,860
Hayato?

384
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,700
No, I'm not Hayato!

385
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,700
Hey, don't lie to me anymore!

386
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,440
No, no, no, no!

387
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,000
Huh?

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,580
What are you doing?

389
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,480
What?

390
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,320
Oh!

391
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,620
Ryo-sama, this isn't Kankichiro.

392
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,640
You...

393
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,480
Huh?

394
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,340
What happened?

395
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,440
Y-Yes?

396
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,580
We were in trouble.

397
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,940
The other day, we went to a restaurant that we wanted to go to.

398
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,220
They said Yasuraoka-san would come at 3.

399
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,760
But we're not there yet.

400
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,840
We might not be able to get there by 3.

401
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,320
I'll be right back.

402
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,220
Mom!

403
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,380
I'm making a mess!

404
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,380
I can't let go of your hand!

405
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,320
Look at me, Hayato!

406
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,060
See?

407
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,600
It feels better now, right?

408
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,840
Did you hit me?

409
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,840
It doesn't hurt!

410
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,640
It doesn't hurt!

411
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,460
I can't help you, Kasen-chan!

412
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,620
It's not my fault!

413
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,160
You're an older brother.

414
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,260
You need to take care of her properly, right?

415
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,880
You want a bicycle?

416
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,200
Everyone has friends!

417
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,980
The only one who doesn't have a bicycle is me!

418
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,280
I'll buy it soon.

419
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,100
It's in the way of work.

420
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Go ahead.

421
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,420
Didn't you say that the other day?

422
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,500
Hey, Mom, buy me a bicycle!

423
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't have time for that.

424
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,160
I'm going to be patient.

425
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,420
I'll fix it.

426
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:56,980
It's useless!

427
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,520
You're so stubborn.

428
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,460
If you can't do it, you can't do it.

429
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,080
What?

430
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,360
You always make me do all the housework!

431
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,600
It's boring!

432
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,840
It's boring!

433
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,000
You can buy me a bicycle!

434
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,700
Hey!

435
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,960
How dare you talk to your parents!

436
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,160
I'll beat you up, you bastards!

437
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,280
You!

438
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,700
Dad and Mom,

439
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,420
I hate you!

440
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,600
You're so annoying!

441
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,300
Hayato!

442
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,220
Get out of here!

443
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm so busy that I don't have time to think about her feelings.

444
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,460
I see.

445
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,660
But why did you call Ryotsu your father again?

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm glad I came home, but I have nowhere to go.

447
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,020
Listen,

448
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm not just going to beat you up.

449
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,900
You're not going to beat me up.

450
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,820
You're going to have to calculate the wind direction and put it on the current.

451
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,620
Hmm...

452
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,880
The wind from the north and the west...

453
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,240
I saw Ryo playing with the children.

454
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,520
You're lying!

455
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,580
Did you find out?

456
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,900
My dad is just like Ryo.

457
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,760
I see.

458
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,580
Dad,

459
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,660
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

460
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,180
Hayato.

461
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,100
Let's go home, Hayato.

462
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:19,940
No!

463
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,360
No!

464
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm going to live with Ryo!

465
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,380
Hayato!

466
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,400
If I go home, I'll be alone again!

467
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Ryo will go to the amusement park with me,

468
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,280
and he'll teach me how to ride a bicycle!

469
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,540
Hey, Ryo.

470
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
Please put me in your room.

471
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,680
Let's live happily with Maria again!

472
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,200
Don't be so nosy!

473
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,260
Who lives with you?

474
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,740
Ryo...

475
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,660
I hate liars and bald people!

476
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,080
Ryo, I'm sorry!

477
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,440
I won't lie to you anymore!

478
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,060
Shut up!

479
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,240
Ryo...

480
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,980
I don't want to see your face ever again!

481
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,240
Go home!

482
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Ryo...

483
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,080
Thank you for taking care of me.

484
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,060
Thank you.

485
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,680
Thank you very much.

486
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,200
Well, take care, Hayato.

487
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,380
Come again sometime.

488
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,000
Come anytime.

489
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,420
Don't lie to me anymore, Kankichiro.

490
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,340
Well, let's go, Hayato.

491
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,380
Kankichiro!

492
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,520
Take the bicycle to the front.

493
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,560
What?

494
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,860
Are you sure?

495
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,300
If you leave it here, it'll be in the way.

496
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,880
This is the full order I made.

497
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,160
You'll be fine.

498
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,420
Take care of yourself.

499
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,560
Don't lie to me!

500
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:50,700
Ryo!

501
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,620
I'll make you ride a bicycle like Ryo!

502
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,040
I'll make you ride a bicycle like Ryo!

503
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,140
