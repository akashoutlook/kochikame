1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,340
The End

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,880
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,720
Make the room brighter and try to look away

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone is calling

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,220
At the end of the rain

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,200
I walked with a look back

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,940
"Mom, give me your hand"

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,800
I felt that strange feeling at that time

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,380
So I tried to walk on the black tile of the Ake-dogai

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:55,200
I tried to walk on the black tile of the Ake-dogai

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,320
Everyone was a child once

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,680
But everyone forgets

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,320
A politician with a proud face

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,780
And a blue aunt on top of her eyes

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,100
Turn around and look at that corner

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,800
You can see everyone

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,420
There is a wall there

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,200
There is a wall there

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,580
There is a wall there

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,760
There is a wall there

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone, come to our town

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,700
Thank you!

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,040
1st Family of Honda Family

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,060
Eve's Treasure

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,280
Ryo-chan?

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,960
Ryo-chan!

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,260
Ryo-chan!

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,400
Oh!

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,000
You sleep so soon

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,660
I'm glad you came to see me

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,640
It's okay

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,420
I was a little close to the patrol

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh no

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,140
We are in the middle of working hours

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,240
Ryo-chan .what?

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,040
Olympia

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,040
Surprisingly

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,180
I love you

39
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,700
Good-bye

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,340
Kindergarten

41
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,400
I also have a golden eyelid

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm gonna eat it.

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,200
Reiko-san, there's a Gakuten-san!

44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,040
I slept well.

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
What are you guys gathering here for?

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,100
Oh, you're awake, Honda.

47
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,060
Yes.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,580
What's wrong? Why are you looking so weird?

49
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,520
I thought the chief was coming.

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,220
No, no, no. It's not like that.

51
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,440
Then, what's that face?

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,860
Well, this face...

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,900
Brother, are you there?

54
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,280
This voice...

55
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,540
Monkey, why are you here?

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,660
I called the station, and I was told it was here.

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,060
Who is that?

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,920
It's my brother, Monkey.

59
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,220
That scary-looking face...

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,960
What?

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,260
When you ride a bicycle, you change your personality.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
It's definitely Mr. Honda's brother.

63
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Did something happen, Monkey?

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,820
Th-That's...

65
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,640
My sister fell down!

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,480
Reiko-san!

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,120
Reiko-san is your sister, right?

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah.

69
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,300
She's not in a good shape.

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,820
I didn't think she would fall.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
Don't get in my way!

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,440
How dare you!

73
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,060
What!?

74
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,740
Let's go somewhere near the pass now, you two!

75
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,320
You two!

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
Get out of here!

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,640
I-I got it.

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Eve!

79
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,300
Father!

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
Hayato, you came at the right time.

81
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,860
How do you feel, Eve?

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,280
I asked the doctor not to be so harsh on you, but...

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,060
Just a moment ago, the doctor did this to you, though.

84
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,840
I was so tired that I caught a cold.

85
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,540
Tired?

86
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,620
Dad, I'm so worried.

87
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,800
I can't stand up.

88
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm so worried.

89
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm so worried.

90
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,440
You're the one who's worried.

91
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,380
I think Honda's owner is.

92
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,040
Here it is.

93
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,260
Wear this.

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,340
Eve is sick.

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,080
I don't have a store.

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,260
You don't have to.

97
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,580
Hayato!

98
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,900
What's wrong with your work?

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,660
Eve fell down.

100
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
People fall down when they're alive.

101
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,700
Don't come back to me.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,460
I'll heal you.

103
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,620
Don't worry.

104
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,160
It's work.

105
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,700
It's a big difference from before.

106
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,740
As expected of the owner of Honda.

107
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,280
Brother.

108
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,900
You said you caught a cold because you were tired, Eve.

109
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,740
I'm sorry to worry you.

110
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,760
It's been a long time.

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,500
I'm your senior, Ryochi.

112
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,900
Have you met before?

113
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,240
I have seen you before.

114
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,240
You're still so fire.

115
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,360
I'm the one.

116
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm the one.

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,380
Have you forgotten my face?

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Senior.

119
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:48,760
Don't say that.

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,480
What?

121
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,020
Your face?

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,300
What happened to my face?

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,640
What?

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,940
What?

125
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,440
Are you crazy?

126
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,820
It's not me.

127
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,140
Ryochi did it.

128
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,540
What?

129
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,360
-Wait! -Shut up!

130
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,660
-Shut up! -Shut up!

131
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,500
-We're home!

132
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,180
-You finally got out. -It seems like Eve finally fell asleep.

133
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,220
-Your sister went to college? -Yes. She's in her first year at college.

134
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,720
-Perhaps she had a problem with her college admission. -Not a university in the city?

135
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,820
-It's in the city, but it's a little far. It takes three hours to get to college. -What?

136
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,560
-It's in the city of Bakao. -Oh.

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,760
-From Minami-Senju, you take the Jouban Line, the Yamanote Line and the Chuo Line.

138
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
-You take the bus for an hour from the station.

139
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,180
-You take the bus for an hour from the station.

140
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,620
-You take the bus for six hours? You're like a manager in a restaurant.

141
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,280
-You didn't go to college?

142
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,780
-It's a little far from my home, but I don't want to go far from home.

143
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,320
-You're so indifferent.

144
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,320
-We're home! -It's Mom.

145
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,920
-You're Ryo? -She heard a lot of rumors from Hayato.

146
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,960
-What kind of rumors? Honda? -I don't like it.

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,920
-Ryo, you're going to eat dinner, right? -Yes.

148
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,400
-If you don't let the guests eat, you're a man.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,720
-I'll cook it right away.

150
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,700
-Hey, how does your mother change her personality? -My mother is a very ordinary mother.

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,240
-Your family changes their personality when they ride a bike or wear a pair of clothes.

152
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,380
-Your mother will definitely be a violent mother when she wears a kappogi.

153
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,500
-That's right.

154
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,140
-Your mother will definitely be a violent mother when she wears a kappogi.

155
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,060
-I thought the same thing.

156
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,440
-I thought the same thing.

157
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,760
-She cut her finger with a knife.

158
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,280
-I can't make it often because I always leave it to Eve.

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,340
-I can't make it often because I always leave it to Eve.

160
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,520
-Your mother is very noisy.

161
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,460
-I told you it was normal.

162
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,080
-I told you it was normal.

163
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,800
-Wait a minute.

164
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,860
-Wait a minute.

165
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,160
-I'm sorry. It's my fault.

166
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,880
-It's okay. I like to cook.

167
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,740
-I'm sorry for the face.

168
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,580
-You should have apologized earlier.

169
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,220
-Well, let's get along with each other when we eat.

170
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,340
-Well, let's get along with each other when we eat.

171
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,640
-That's right.

172
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,640
-Let's eat!

173
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,240
-This is delicious. You can be a good wife.

174
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,440
-Thank you very much.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,660
-Thank you very much.

176
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,560
-But your mother is lively.

177
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,420
-She has a foreign personality.

178
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,200
-She is active in the family office.

179
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,240
-I didn't know that a daughter who is so shy from her mother was born.

180
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,260
-Eve was not so shy when she was a child.

181
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,760
-That was the beginning of an incident when she was a child.

182
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,720
-What happened?

183
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,920
-I went to the Arakawa amusement park with Eve and Monkey.

184
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,520
-Arakawa amusement park. I miss it.

185
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
-That's what Ryo-chan often said.

186
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,380
-I said that a lot before.

187
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,600
-At that time, I'm in trouble with Eve, and I get on a Ferris wheel.

188
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,540
-Then all of a sudden...

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,860
-What?

190
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:53,600
-Abut four minutes ago, the Ferris wheel was taken off.

191
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,420
-About four minutes ago, the Ferris wheel was taken off.

192
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,520
There are people who do terrible things.

193
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,620
Ah, I remember it too.

194
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,640
Eve got scared and since then she has become extremely reluctant to go outside.

195
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,580
Thanks to it, her personality has become introverted and her body has become weak.

196
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,980
I will never forgive that guy who dropped the 2B bullet!

197
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,100
If he wasn't there, Eve would have become a bright and strong girl!

198
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,120
Hmm, I understand your feelings.

199
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,620
Senpai!

200
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
Hmm...

201
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,540
What you just said...

202
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,840
I heard it somewhere.

203
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,060
Ryo-chan, didn't you say that before?

204
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,720
That he threw the 2B bullet from the Ferris wheel.

205
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,580
What?

206
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,580
No, I mean, there were a lot of people who did that back then.

207
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,680
I think he dropped it at a boy who was wearing a Nippon Ham hat.

208
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,300
What?

209
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,780
That day, I was wearing a Nippon Ham hat!

210
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,240
What?

211
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,140
Then,

212
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,860
Was the 2B bullet...

213
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,520
Senpai?

214
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,780
That's...

215
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,480
All because of Senpai.

216
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,540
What should we do, Senpai?

217
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,680
Well,

218
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,780
Oh, right, let's see what Eve-chan looks like.

219
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm worried about her.

220
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm more worried about her being alone with Senpai!

221
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,460
Eve, are you okay?

222
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,640
She seems to be having a fever.

223
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,480
She has a weak body.

224
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,860
Who do you think that caused her to become like this?

225
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,700
E-E, you...

226
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,080
It's hot.

227
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,000
Did you say it's hot? Eve?

228
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,740
Wait! I'll get you ice right away!

229
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,560
Ice, ice!

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,300
What else do you want?

231
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,000
Water...

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,140
Okay, water!

233
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,600
It's water.

234
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,180
What a naughty boy.

235
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,280
It's for my sister.

236
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,600
Is there anything else you want?

237
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,240
A ring.

238
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,880
A ring?

239
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,440
When I was a kid, a ring...

240
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,940
When you were a kid...

241
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,280
You're asleep.

242
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,380
It's like you're asleep.

243
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
Eve...

244
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,400
You've got a lot of precious things.

245
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,620
Everything I had when I was a kid is all here.

246
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,720
Eve's childhood toys should be here too.

247
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm hungry.

248
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,920
This is a supercar eraser.

249
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
You're going to do all kinds of things with it, aren't you?

250
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,220
There's a rider snack inside.

251
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,580
Ryo, you're not here to play.

252
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,100
Look for your ring.

253
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,620
Whose fault is it, Eve?

254
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,660
I know.

255
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,500
Did you find it?

256
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,080
It's this.

257
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,020
The hat that my senior hit me with a 2D bullet.

258
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,600
You don't have to show me that.

259
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,820
You even have a diary.

260
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,200
I met Megumi-chan three times today.

261
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,400
I was very happy.

262
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,780
Please don't.

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,300
It's not easy to read people's diaries.

264
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,600
What?

265
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,740
I went to the festival today and bought a ring.

266
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,660
And I gave it to my sister.

267
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,220
Isn't this the ring?

268
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,660
I remember now.

269
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,260
I remember now.

270
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,080
I bought this ring because I wanted to give it to my favorite girl.

271
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,340
But...

272
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,960
I don't need it.

273
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,880
I was easily rejected.

274
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,040
I had no choice but to take it home.

275
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,720
Eve looked very happy.

276
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,540
So I gave it to Eve.

277
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,300
By the way, I've been taking care of it for a while like a treasure.

278
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,920
Do you know where it is now?

279
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,800
Hmm...

280
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,300
Oh, maybe...

281
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,580
Oh, I found it.

282
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,100
After a while, the three brothers filled the time capsule.

283
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,380
I put everyone's treasures in it.

284
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,860
Where is it?

285
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,840
It's written here.

286
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Behind the Toei house...

287
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,700
Beside the forest...

288
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,640
Harappa...

289
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,120
Well, it's certainly here.

290
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,240
In the past, this was the playground.

291
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,620
It's perfectly covered with concrete.

292
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,380
I have no choice but to give up.

293
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,860
No...

294
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,300
No way.

295
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,700
Eve...

296
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,280
Eve...

297
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,400
Eve...

298
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,180
I can't give up!

299
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,380
Eve is waiting for me!

300
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
Let's go there and borrow the tools!

301
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,940
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

302
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,660
Well...

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not here, is it?

304
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,320
It's not here...

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
No, there's no doubt.

306
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,160
It should be buried here.

307
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,860
Senpai, don't touch it!

308
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,580
Huh, I got it...

309
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,520
Senpai!

310
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,200
Honda!

311
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,800
I got it.

312
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,340
Hmm?

313
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,820
When making the parking lot, this ground was dug up, and it seems to have been transported to another site.

314
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
Another site...

315
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,000
Where?

316
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,400
That's the Tamas.

317
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,080
Tamas?

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,720
It's a huge, far away thing again.

319
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,540
Tamas...

320
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,120
Hey.

321
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,820
Hey, is that Tama?

322
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,260
Of course! I'm going to find her!

323
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,640
I can't go with you. I'm going home.

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,980
Who did this to you, Eve?!

325
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,800
I know, I know.

326
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,040
You look so close, Takao-san.

327
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,960
Eve's university is over there, right?

328
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,340
It's 50 kilometers from Kameari.

329
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,100
I thought I'd come a long way.

330
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,500
I came here.

331
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,520
There's a lot of dirt in the parking lot here.

332
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,200
Yeah.

333
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,860
I don't know exactly where it is,

334
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,180
but it's probably used for some kind of building.

335
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,800
It's not very good to end up like this, but I can't help it.

336
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,480
It's a poison for the body.

337
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,220
It's a shame, but I'll give up.

338
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,360
Then let's get started.

339
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Hey, didn't you hear what I just said?

340
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,440
It's used for a building around here, right?

341
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,740
Then I'll go back!

342
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,020
This is the first one.

343
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,680
You have to dig it all back.

344
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm thinking it'll take a few days.

345
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,080
Eve's waiting!

346
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
I'll dig it up no matter how many days it takes!

347
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,140
What do you mean by a few days?

348
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Who are you blaming, Eve?!

349
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,800
I got it, I got it.

350
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,940
Huh?

351
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,380
Isn't this the company in Nagagawa?

352
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,780
Oh, they're doing construction to extend our subway.

353
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,260
I see. This can be used.

354
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,860
Then there's a better way to dig it up than this.

355
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,440
Senior, could it be...

356
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,340
Hmm, I'll look for it up close.

357
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,900
Could you lend me a hand?

358
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,880
S-Sr. President, what are you doing here?

359
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,500
There's a new type of tunnel cutter.

360
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,700
Could you lend me a hand?

361
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,180
Huh?

362
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,640
N-No...

363
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,600
Huh...

364
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,420
Hmm...

365
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,620
Hmm...

366
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,400
This should have a metal detector.

367
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,600
Okay!

368
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,700
I did it!

369
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,620
Now I know where the time capsule is.

370
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,580
I see, I see.

371
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,020
It looks like it's pretty easy to operate.

372
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,060
I mean, it's a little...

373
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,180
No...

374
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,400
N-No, no, no, nooo!

375
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,160
Wait, Eve!

376
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll be right back.

377
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,360
Okay.

378
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,580
What is it?

379
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,620
What's wrong!?

380
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,280
Where is the time capsule?

381
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,840
Here it is!

382
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,800
Honda, we're getting metal reaction from the upper right!

383
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,560
I got it!

384
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,460
Alright, let's keep going straight!

385
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,940
It's a water pipe!

386
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,120
It's a water pipe, it doesn't matter!

387
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,260
Now!

388
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,720
This is Tokugawa's treasure!

389
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Alright, let's stop!

390
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,080
Stop!

391
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,280
There's no way to escape!

392
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,220
Eve!

393
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,000
The water pipe!

394
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,360
There's something in front of us!

395
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,580
Wait for me, Eve!

396
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,600
I'll find you no matter what happens!

397
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,700
Eve!

398
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,360
Eve!

399
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,040
Damn it! Where's the water pipe?!

400
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,200
"Akatsuki"

401
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,820
"Akatsuki"

402
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,620
"Akatsuki"

403
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,600
"Akatsuki"

404
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,060
"Akatsuki"

405
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,880
"Akatsuki"

406
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,900
"Akatsuki"

407
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,180
"Akatsuki"

408
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,540
"Akatsuki"

409
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,960
"Akatsuki"

410
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,520
"Akatsuki"

411
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,560
"Akatsuki"

412
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:53,880
"Akatsuki"

413
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,180
"Akatsuki"

414
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
"Akatsuki"

415
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,780
"Akatsuki"

416
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,360
"Akatsuki"

417
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,780
"Akatsuki"

418
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,680
"Akatsuki"

419
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,060
"Akatsuki"

420
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,540
"Akatsuki"

421
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:29,700
"I've finally found it, Eve."

422
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,880
"This."

423
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,460
"This is a time capsule from my childhood."

424
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,360
"The other day, you were talking about your ring, right?"

425
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,300
"Honda-san, you came all the way here to find it, didn't you?"

426
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
"Brother..."

427
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
"I'm sorry, Eve."

428
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,060
"Huh?"

429
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,960
"Here you go."

430
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,820
"This ring was given to me by my brother."

431
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,780
"It won't fit."

432
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,800
"That means Eve has grown up, too."

433
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,100
"That's right. She has to grow up."

434
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
"Brother, I've made up my mind."

435
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,960
"I'm going to leave home and live in Ryo."

436
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,140
"What?"

437
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,740
"Eve..."

438
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,000
"I've been thinking about it for a long time."

439
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,900
"When I become a college student, I have to fix my shyness and be more solid."

440
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,320
"I think it would be better to live together with a lot of people in Ryo."

441
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,300
"So that's why you chose a university far away."

442
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,680
"But I can't get a good result in the end."

443
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,200
"Thanks to you, I finally got a good result."

444
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,620
"That Ryo is my new home."

445
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,560
"Eve..."

446
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,580
"W-what?"

447
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,400
"Oh!"

448
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,540
"Why is that group..."

449
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,960
"They escaped from the nearby Tama Zoo!"

450
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:17,800
"Oh!"

451
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,120
"They're going to dig the ground up!"

452
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,600
"They're going to dig the ground up!"

453
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,660
"They're going to dig the ground up!"

454
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,180
"They're going to dig the ground up!"

455
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,480
"They're coming this way. Let's run!"

456
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:26,980
"Oh!"

457
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,800
"Eve!"

458
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,100
"Eve!"

459
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,420
"I'm saved. I was just put on my back."

460
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,220
"I'm saved. I was just put on my back."

461
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,240
"Hey, I remember your little sister riding on an elephant..."

462
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,840
"Ararararara!"

463
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,920
"The Honda on the motorcycle becomes a violent"

464
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,900
"The little sister on the elephant becomes violent."

465
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,080
"The little sister on the elephant becomes a violent."

466
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
"Hey, what are you guys doing?"

467
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,160
"Come on, you idiots!"

468
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,360
"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"

469
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,340
Let's go, Kame-dono!

470
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,820
We're heading to the dormitory of Eve-chan's university!

471
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm going to join this dormitory this time!

472
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,580
I'm here to greet you!

473
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,740
Let's go!

474
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,820
Eve-chan won't be able to enter the dormitory for the time being.

475
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,720
How could she destroy her new home herself?

476
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,720
Eve-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

477
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,200
What a bad dormitory!

478
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,920
Let's build a stronger one!

479
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,060

Next time, chase a turtle

Chief

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,860
Thank you!
