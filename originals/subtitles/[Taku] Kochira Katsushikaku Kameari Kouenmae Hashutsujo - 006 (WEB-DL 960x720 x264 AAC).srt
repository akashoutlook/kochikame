00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:13,940
"The Summer of the Year"

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,180
Ah, the summer of the year has come again!

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,120
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here!

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,060
Ah, the summer of the year has come again!

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,080
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here!

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,620
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here!

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,160
It's a big, little, little, awesome boba!

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,960
Ah, the summer of the year has come again!

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,480
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, here, it's here!

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:51,740
It's a big, little, little, awesome boba!

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,160
The big, little, little, awesome boba!

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,080
It's a big, little, little, awesome boba!

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,620
It's a big, little, little, awesome boba!

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,620
Nagi - Sade

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,540
Purin-purin-purin-purin-purin-purin

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,940
Purin-purin-purin-purin-purin-purin

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,660
Ah-Ah!

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,620
The wind blows south

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,640
Ah-Ah!

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,320
The wind blows south

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,960
Ah-Ah!

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,480
Nagi - Sade

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,880
Purin-purlin-purin-purin

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,400
Megumin

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Reiko's Wrath of Anger

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:33,940
Move!

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,640
The tomato has entered the million-spin red zone!

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,540
And now, it's time to power up to 2 million spins!

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,500
The reaction is a curve of 90 degrees!

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,540
This is scary! It's dangerous!

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,720
Stop at the corner once.

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,640
Look to the right and left to see if a car is coming.

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,620
And then check the safety.

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,220
Got it?

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,520
Run!

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
Don't jump out!

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,800
No!

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,520
It's okay.

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,580
If I'm late for my shift, Ryo-chan will be noisy.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Hey, Riko.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
Hello. How's the old man's cold?

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
He's already feverish.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,000
He'll be able to go to the store in 2 or 3 days.

44
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
It's hard for Grandma to do it alone.

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,940
I'm sorry, but take care of yourself.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,340
Then, take care.

47
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,600
Wait.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,020
I'm grateful to Reiko-chan who always cares about me.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,300
It's business, but bring it.

50
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,140
Ah, um, I was told it was 12 o'clock, but I'm totally late.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,460
Yes.

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Ah, thank you very much.

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,440
She's a good girl, isn't she?

54
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,160
There aren't many good girls with such a good temper.

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,120
She's a good girl, and she's a special one.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,900
I can't take her home with my wife.

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Really?

58
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,100
Just a second.

59
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,360
Let's cross the road, Grandma.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,820
Well, if we go around the street, there's a road sign.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,140
There are many cars here, so it'll help us.

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,400
There's a signal here, so hold on.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Yes.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
Hurry up!

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,140
Huh?

66
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Please wait a moment.

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,740
Yes, yes.

68
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
What is it?

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,020
Well, um...

70
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,260
That old lady has waited a long time to cross this road.

71
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,560
If you can hold on for about 30 seconds...

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,860
Yes...

73
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,920
Oh, thank you very much.

75
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,820
Thank you so much!

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,340
No, I have to be careful.

77
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,180
That's great, Reiko-san.

78
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,660
Would you come here for a moment, please?

79
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,840
Eh?

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,900
Reiko-san, could you come this way.

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,500
I have a message for you.

82
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,240
Come back here tomorrow!

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,600
What's your problem?

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,760
hover

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,280
This is for a while every day.

86
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,500
It's in front of kindergarten, and children will get drunk with their car.

87
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,700
I'm careful many times, but I don't ask.

88
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,540
Isn't it the center of the street, Tsuzushi?

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,500
Please move the car with the handCard that is stopped in front of the kindergarten.

90
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,720
Speedy

91
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:07,900
"Captain's House"

92
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,180
"Captain's House"

93
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,800
"Captain's House"

94
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,020
"Captain's House"

95
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,500
So, we've been standing here.

96
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,060
We're at the repair shop nearby.

97
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,280
I think they're already here!

98
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,940
They said the same thing yesterday.

99
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,920
They're lying!

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,180
Here's your license.

101
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,180
Please forgive me.

102
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,920
I don't have any more points.

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,080
You're cute, "Captain's House"

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't have a license.

105
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
I don't even have to move.

106
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,640
Do you understand?

107
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,040
Please forgive me.

108
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,160
Then, I'll give you a hand.

109
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,740
What's that?

110
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
It's supposed to be a bomb for jacking up.

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,160
If you raise the level to the maximum, it will swell up to anywhere.

112
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,880
On!

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,640
Hey!

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,740
Hey, idiot!

115
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,700
I don't know how to stop it.

116
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,700
Because it's my first time using it.

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,620
Oh, no!

118
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,480
Damn it!

119
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,440
What the hell!

120
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,400
Charge!

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,500
Sucker.

122
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,700
You've got the same color legs!

123
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,340
What?

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,600
How frightening!

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,360
These legs...

126
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,420
"I'm sorry, but I can't let this go."

127
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,460
"I'm sorry, but I can't let this go."

128
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,440
"Of course. Pay the fine."

129
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,580
"Oh, no!"

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,560
"Welcome home."

131
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,620
"Ah."

132
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,940
"You're late!"

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
"Sorry, Ryo-chan."

134
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
"The time to change is 12 o'clock in the afternoon."

135
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,420
"It's past 1 o'clock."

136
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,040
"Hey, I'm a mess in this town."

137
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,020
"I'm a mess in this town."

138
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,800
"A patrol and my life, which matters?"

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,180
"A patrol and my life, which matters?"

140
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,220
"Even if you want to change, you'd still be there at 11 o'clock."

141
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,900
"Even if you want to change, you'd still be there at 11 o'clock."

142
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
"A patrol and my life, which matters?"

143
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,460
"Today, Doctor Ohara isn't coming, so I'll try to stay the same."

144
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,900
"I'm going to the patrol!"

145
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,060
"Ah. You look hungry."

146
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,620
"You'll have to come back anytime."

147
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,600
I couldn't go out for lunch.

148
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,680
Don't boil the noodles too much.

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,220
Add more green onions.

150
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,220
It's not like I forgot the change time.

151
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,560
It was hard.

152
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,880
This and that, and now and then.

153
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Reiko!

154
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,180
What's wrong, Ryo?

155
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,840
Take a picture of that newspaper.

156
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,340
Isn't it faster to take it yourself?

157
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
There are so many bad people out there.

158
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
They say it's a car accident, but it doesn't work at all.

159
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,300
They think it's a bad thing, and they just ignore it.

160
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,580
Take a look at your back.

161
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,000
Lower.

162
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
Not there.

163
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,880
There, there.

164
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,620
Push it.

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,740
That's it.

166
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,020
Like this?

167
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,960
No.

168
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,900
It doesn't work at all.

169
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,320
That's why I'm telling you.

170
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,880
That's why I'm being underestimated.

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,300
It doesn't matter.

172
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,660
What patrol needs is the power of the face.

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
Your face doesn't have the power of the face.

174
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,400
It's itchy.

175
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,060
Draw the bottom part.

176
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,160
Here?

177
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,440
Yes, yes.

178
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey, is the noodles okay?

179
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,440
Don't boil it too much.

180
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,860
It's itchy again.

181
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,300
It hurts!

182
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,500
What are you doing?

183
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,000
The last one is the power of the face, right?

184
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,380
The last one.

185
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,720
What?

186
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,340
It's itchy.

187
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,240
It's itchy.

188
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,200
I'll hit you with the second one.

189
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,480
I'll run away with the second one.

190
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
What's that?

191
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,680
It's the special pillow for hitting the Ryo-chan.

192
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,820
It's handmade.

193
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,800
What?

194
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,640
How's that?

195
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,760
Uncertainty.

196
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,860
Start attacking!

197
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,420
Be aware of the power of men!

198
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,340
Thatialic!

199
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,600
I fried you!

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,940
The match is just beginning.

201
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,940
Fight with your own power if you can't have strength!

202
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
Come on!

203
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,240
Come on!

204
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,800
Come on!

205
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,240
Come on!

206
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,880
I got it!

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,140
I can take the hell!

208
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,860
It's over!

209
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,120
Wait! Wait!

210
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,300
What a hard-working woman!

211
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,300
Yes?

212
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,600
I saw the poster.

213
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,420
Huh? Who did you get it from?

214
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,720
It's Reiko, right?

215
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,920
Who are you?

216
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,560
Please go on a date with me.

217
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,140
Eh? Who are you?

218
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,660
Why do you have this number?

219
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,420
It was written on the poster.

220
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,380
What's that?

221
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,640
What's wrong?

222
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
I don't know.

223
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,960
I don't know what to do with the poster.

224
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,700
It's a strange number.

225
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Hello?

226
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,220
Is that Reiko?

227
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,040
Who are you?

228
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,400
Can we go to the beach together?

229
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,840
No, you can't.

230
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,460
Then, I can't?

231
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,780
You can go on your own.

232
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,040
What's this?

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,100
It's so annoying.

234
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
You don't even have to say my name.

235
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:31,920
Date?

236
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,500
Okay, let me borrow it.

237
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,780
Reiko?

238
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,920
Oh, right.

239
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,940
Are you applying for a date?

240
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,160
Yes.

241
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay, first, I'll give you 5,000 yen as an introduction fee.

242
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,400
Don't say stupid things.

243
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,120
Or I'll arrest you.

244
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,920
Reiko.

245
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,820
Huh?

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,220
There are so many of these on the surface.

247
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,100
What's this?

248
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,240
The guys just now picked up the phone by looking at this.

249
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,340
What a terrible hidden photo.

250
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,500
Who put this here?

251
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,800
I took a lot of pictures, but it's still a mess around the national highway.

252
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,100
It's stuck on the wall.

253
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,980
It's a good one.

254
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,460
Reiko, what about this?

255
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,900
There's no way.

256
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,520
This is Naoko.

257
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,520
Answer me.

258
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,140
Hm?

259
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,780
I found a large dumpster.

260
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,680
It's following us.

261
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,640
It's heading north.

262
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,780
Please support it.

263
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,880
The driver was sticking a poster of Reiko.

264
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,040
Roger that.

265
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,860
I'll use scissors to cut it open.

266
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,840
It's so big.

267
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,820
It's Reiko's big dumpster.

268
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,500
I think it's Reiko's big dumpster.

269
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
Neither of them knows the signal.

270
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,280
That's great.

271
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,300
Reiko, they're taking it away.

272
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,660
Can you see it?

273
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,840
Hm?

274
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Oh, I see that.

275
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh, I see that.

276
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,920
Hey, you're in a hurry, Ocho!

277
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,940
Huh? What's that, hey?

278
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,180
Watch out!

279
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,780
The End

280
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,920
Are you okay?

281
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

282
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,460
That's good.

283
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,300
Mira! I'm getting my hands on you!

284
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Ouch! My back hurts too.

285
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,080
I won't forgive you!

286
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,480
Reiko, you're too rough!

287
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,200
Ouch!

288
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,660
Put on your seatbelt!

289
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,560
I'll report to the police.

290
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,320
I'm Ryotsu. I'm tracking the dump truck of Adachi Number.

291
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,800
The driver of that dump truck was on Reiko's poster.

292
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,900
Okay, let's go!

293
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,460
You guys go straight to Mid-Kaido!

294
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,060
Put on your seatbelt!

295
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,380
Ouch!

296
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,960
I won't let you get away!

297
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,520
Huh?

298
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,580
Ah! I found it!

299
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,860
Arrgh!

300
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,120
Arrgh!

301
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
I found it!

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:35,960
Arrgh!

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,780
Arrgh!

304
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,320
Arrgh!

305
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,560
Arrgh!

306
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,320
Arrgh!

307
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Arrgh!

308
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,300
Arrgh!

309
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,000
Arrgh!

310
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,500
Arrgh!

311
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:49,900
Arrgh!

312
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,720
Arrgh!

313
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,720
Arrgh!

314
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:54,820
Arrgh!

315
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
Arrgh!

316
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,120
Arrgh!

317
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,360
Arrgh!

318
00:15:59,680 --> 00:15:59,700
Arrgh!

319
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,740
It's just as they say.

320
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,020
What happened, Reiko?

321
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,820
Oh, come on, you guys.

322
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,520
We were about to lose the kids.

323
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,160
Besides,

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,040
why should I have any grudge against you?

325
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,480
I-I don't have any grudge against you.

326
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,000
Then why did you guys

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,940
stick these things all over the place?

328
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,780
Reiko!

329
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,660
Look over there.

330
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,820
It's them!

331
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Them?

332
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,720
I found them!

333
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,060
You guys are coming, right?

334
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,940
I'll leave the rest to you!

335
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,620
Yes!

336
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,420
Hurry up, Ryoichi!

337
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,120
Arrgh!

338
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,200
It's the car that was parked in front of the kindergarten.

339
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,100
Those guys are illegal parking.

340
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,240
Anyway, it's a very bad car.

341
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,300
It's probably a natural monument.

342
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,560
What's going on here?

343
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,220
They're not just running around!

344
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,060
Shut up!

345
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,280
Hey!

346
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,280
Don't let them get away!

347
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,220
If that's the case,

348
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,640
we should have tried to kill you more thoroughly then!

349
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,180
Shut up!

350
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,020
It's Godot here!

351
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,880
Damn, what tough and stubborn!

352
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,580
What?!

353
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
My way of doing it is quite annoying.

354
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,760
That is indeed violent.

355
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,200
You dare drive me with a allowed car, just a few bucks.

356
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,060
If you have original deal, you should go back to my house.

357
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,260
That's right, that's right!

358
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,300
No more others!

359
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,840
Wait for us!

360
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,380
Calm down Reiko!

361
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,240
I get how you feel but the Mini Patto is a 550cc light car.

362
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,080
There's no way you can catch up with a 2000cc like that!

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,540
Hey! It's still following us!

364
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,540
It's not just a light car...

365
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,720
It's so fast that it can go that far with a light car!

366
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,020
Let's go into high speed.

367
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,340
That car can't go at high speed.

368
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,500
It's running away into high speed.

369
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,040
We can't catch up with it with this car.

370
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,760
This is Reiko.

371
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,980
Yes, this is Kamehameha Park.

372
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,020
Kei, I have a favor to ask of you.

373
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
I can't see anymore.

374
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Hey, Reiko!

375
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,320
Oh no!

376
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,940
Hurry up and stop it!

377
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,660
Stop it!

378
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,120
Oh, here it is!

379
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,880
Oh, it's the Audi Quattro.

380
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,720
Sorry I'm late.

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,320
It just arrived yesterday.

382
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,220
This car won the Monte Carlo Rally.

383
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,640
I got it from the collector for free.

384
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,580
I'll borrow it then.

385
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,620
I didn't see it until now.

386
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,000
But it's coming after me.

387
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,020
Hey, maybe they're...

388
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
I'll see you later.

389
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Go, go!

390
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,760
I'll be right there!

391
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,640
Oh.

392
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,200
What? What's wrong?

393
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,740
It's like a gas station.

394
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,660
I'm so frustrated!

395
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,300
What's the matter, Nakagawa?

396
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,220
You don't like gas and you're always full of it.

397
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,500
There's no gas station at high speed.

398
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,500
You're driving at high speed at high speed.

399
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:47,900
Look, you found no gas station!

400
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,380
Reiko.

401
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:49,980
Slow down.

402
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,840
I'll go for the car from the back.

403
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,360
What?

404
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,440
What?

405
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
What are they doing?

406
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,920
Damn it!

407
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,060
I'm exhausted.

408
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,920
I can't reach it!

409
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,380
100 yen for 1 liter.

410
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,240
45 liters for 4510 yen!

411
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,740
Huh?

412
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,460
Great.

413
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,940
Reiko, pay me 4500 yen.

414
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,800
That's enough for fishing!

415
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,460
"That's enough"?

416
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,700
Does that mean you don't need it?

417
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,260
Alright! I'll take the fishing rod!

418
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,080
What is this?

419
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,600
Hurry up and give me the money!

420
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,860
-The fishing rod is... -Youji, hurry up and take it!

421
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,500
Give me the fishing rod!

422
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,180
My money!

423
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,240
I want the fishing rod!

424
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,460
I want the fishing rod!

425
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,140
My money!

426
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,460
It's here again!

427
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't want it anymore!

428
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,380
Damn it!

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
My money!

430
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,820
Damn it, Presta!

431
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,460
You're too naive! Are you trying to escape?

432
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,860
Reiko, go! I'll forgive you!

433
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,440
Wait a minute!

434
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,540
The highway! Don't turn around!

435
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,460
You're too naive, Reiko!

436
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,980
Sakotan, it's too snowy!

437
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,600
How far can we climb with that car?

438
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,160
How far can we climb with that car?

439
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,020
How far can we climb with that car?

440
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,580
Stop it, Reiko!

441
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,820
No matter how many Audi cars there are,

442
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
the snow is too heavy!

443
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,060
The snow is too heavy!

444
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,920
I did it!

445
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,120
I did it!

446
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,740
I got rid of the car!

447
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,060
I got rid of the car!

448
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,300
Help me!

449
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,500
This is scary!

450
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,820
It's scary when a woman looks down, you know?

451
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,380
Let's not allow him to be the enemy, at all.

452
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,900
He may climb, but it won't be when we're impossible to take him down.

453
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,040
He may climb, but it won't be when we're impossible to take him down.

454
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,120
He may climb, but it won't be when we're impossible to take him down.

455
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,140
He may climb, but it won't be when we're impossible to take him down.

456
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,500
And no!

457
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,200
Stop it!

458
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,820
Don't make me stop!

459
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:34,920
The

460
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,020
The

461
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:35,900
The

462
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,560
The

463
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,020
The

464
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,560
The

465
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:37,880
The

466
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,100
The

467
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,820
Good morning!

468
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,320
Good morning!

469
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm so exhausted.

470
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,400
Ehehe.

471
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,500
Good work.

472
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,440
What happened to those two?

473
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,820
They fell in love with Reiko's driving technique,

474
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,100
and they entered the test drive without permission.

475
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,260
I see.

476
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,080
It's been a while since I had such a terrible feeling.

477
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,520
I've had such a terrible feeling for a long time.

478
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,980
I hope you'll be careful about Reiko.

479
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,900
Okay?

480
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,640
Ryo-chan!

481
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,280
Did you call me?

482
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,700
Yes.

483
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,480
Here's your tea.

484
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,940
Thank you for your delicious tea, Reiko-san.

485
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,860
Thank you.

486
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,420
It's nice weather.

487
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,780
Be careful.

488
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,780
I know.

489
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,420
Oh, it's the old lady.

490
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,780
She's very kind.

491
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you.

492
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,920
You're welcome.

493
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,880
Reiko-chan!

494
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Oh, grandma.

495
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,120
What's wrong?

496
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,720
Actually, Reiko-chan has a good story.

497
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,180
What?

498
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,020
You're an old lady after all.

499
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,740
You're so old, grandma.

500
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,280
Hey,

501
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
if you marry her,

502
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,740
you'll meet a great man, right?

503
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,460
Yes.

504
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,580
Oh, my.

505
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,820
I wonder why you came here.

506
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,520
I already told you.

507
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,440
I've coming to your hospital.

508
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,560
I wanted to test your politeness.

509
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:09,720
I want to understand what you're thinking.

510
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm a niob to you.

511
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,520
For a long time.

512
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,420
So you're a niob.

513
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,380
Emotions!

514
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:17,720
All right.

515
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,100
So let's go.

516
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,220
Shut your mouth.

517
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:20,980
Yes.

518
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,400
Nice to meet you!

519
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,020
Hey, please smile

520
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,080
You're not bad

521
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,420
Hey, please smile

522
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,820
You're in the same condition as before

523
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,380
Please always smile

524
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,160
The woman who is serious is not beautiful

525
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,840
You should smile right away

526
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,220
You're not a child
