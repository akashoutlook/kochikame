00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Episode 1: The

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,420
I was sleeping here, even though it's a day off.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,420
Ryo-tsu! Ryo-tsu! Ryo-tsu!

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:19,920
Hey!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,100
Listen, Ryo-tsu.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
The pot I put here is a souvenir for the next foreign guests.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,140
Don't break it. Got it?

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,640
I really can't help it.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,620
Yes?

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
What's up, mother?

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,980
Huh?

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,060
The vase?

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,980
Why do I have such a thing?

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,940
The vase is in the expo...

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,060
Huh?

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,760
I have something that's convenient.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,340
Okay, okay.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,120
I'll bring it to you right now.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,660
Wait for me.

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,940
I'll go get it.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,580
Okay.

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,480
When you watch the TV, make the room bright and move away.

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,840
Ryo-tsu! Ryo-tsu!

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,120
Ryo-tsu!

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,000
Come with me if you have no money.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,920
I don't have any, but I'm worried about you.

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,120
Look at the blue sky.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,000
The sky, the white clouds

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,180
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:54,320
Come to me, you jobless guy

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,040
Come to me

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,780
I'm not here, but don't worry

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,040
Look, the red cloud is burning

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,800
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,380
Do you understand?

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,460
I understand, I understand

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,780
If you understand, then shut up and follow me

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,180
I understand, I understand

41
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,060
If you understand, then shut up and follow me

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,420
I understand, I understand

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,120
If you understand, then shut up and follow me

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,060
Live broadcast tonight?

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
A pot?

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,720
Yes, it was in the back room.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,980
A pot-shaped one. Ryo, don't you know?

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,720
Hmm.

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,420
Hmm.

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:54,780
Hmm.

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,820
Do you know where this pot is?

52
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,780
Yes, my mother said she wanted a vase.

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,540
I thought this dirty pot would be good for a house like ours.

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,280
I brought it.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,460
I brought it.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,700
What happened to that pot?

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,840
That's the boss's important pot.

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,540
The boss came and said, "The pot is gone!"

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,160
The boss came and said, "The pot is gone!"

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,600
It was a big fuss.

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,140
It was a big fuss.

62
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,180
He gave it to a foreign customer.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,420
It's bad.

64
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,640
It's bad.

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay, I'll go to Asakusa and get it right away.

66
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,460
If the boss comes, please trick him.

67
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,780
Okay, I'll go to Asakusa and get it right away.

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,000
If the boss comes, please trick him.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
What a mess.

70
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,960
Did you get caught by a thief?

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,800
Yes, I'm sorry.

72
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,640
Please let me in.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,240
Hey, Dad.

74
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,420
What happened?

75
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,540
Are you alive?

76
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,780
What's wrong?

77
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,060
What do you mean, what's wrong?

78
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,360
It's obvious.

79
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,780
It's one of us.

80
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,520
What?

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,140
What's wrong, Dad?

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,200
That's it.

83
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,460
Is it Asukusa Fukada?

84
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,940
No, it's not.

85
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,000
The role of this drama is Shizuka.

86
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,320
What?

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,920
Drama?

88
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
Director, did you hear this?

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
What's wrong, Murata?

90
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,680
Murata, a character with this life suddenly came.

91
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,400
What do you mean by this drama?

92
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,800
You idiot!

93
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,880
You don't know the doll drama would put on stage!

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,780
No, Director.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
This is a special films of Kyoho.

96
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
But I still know it is the fan.

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,540
What's going on?

98
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:38,980
Huh?

99
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,160
You used my house for a TV drama shoot?

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,660
Yes. It's about Tsukudaniya's father and his daughter.

101
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,020
This drama is great.

102
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,000
It's starring the popular Asuko Fukada and the charming Kazumasa Murata.

103
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,960
Oh! Is that Kiriko Koizumi, the actress?

104
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,480
Kiriko Koizumi?

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
She's Aoyanari Kiyokazu.

106
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,560
That cat is also in the commercial.

107
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,960
She's very generous when she meets a famous cat.

108
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,360
She's more expensive than our salary.

109
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,080
But still, is it okay to have so many people in this small room?

110
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,320
We're rehearsing right now.

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,780
The opening performance will be on the 35th anniversary tonight at 7.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,460
There's a 2-hour live special.

113
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,840
Hmm. So what happened to the parents?

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,920
Did they get kicked out of the house?

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,040
No, they went to the first-class hotel in the city.

116
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,020
A hotel?

117
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,500
Yes. Asakusa...

118
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,740
Asakusa Beauty Hotel's special suite?

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,840
Here it is!

120
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,280
Here it is!

121
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,820
This is amazing!

122
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,620
As expected of a special suite.

123
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,140
Hey, Kankichi.

124
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:12,900
Huh?

125
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,340
What's wrong?

126
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,360
Why are you standing right in front of the door?

127
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,620
Because it's too big and I can't calm down.

128
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,100
What are you going to do with just the 4th class of the special suite?

129
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,000
You're so poor.

130
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,800
Huh?

131
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:28,920
Huh?

132
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,520
Huh?

133
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,380
You don't have to wash the baby...

134
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,060
Huh?

135
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,900
You don't have to go to such a place!

136
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,120
Is it okay to leave it to so many people?

137
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,180
It's okay. I'm paying a high price for that.

138
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,000
Huh? What are you doing for lunch?

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm preparing breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the hotel.

140
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,260
Sorry to keep you waiting.

141
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,200
I brought you a snack.

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,120
I brought you a snack.

143
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,220
Oh, this luxury meal for lunch.

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,600
Enjoy your lunch.

145
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, I'm sorry!

146
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,340
Thank you for your hard work.

147
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,520
You don't have to apologize for anything.

148
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,900
I was so nervous when I saw the other party.

149
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,200
Anyway, can you eat all this luxurious food when you're old?

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,080
I'll leave most of it. I'm not good at cooking.

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,820
I'll leave most of it.

152
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,740
I don't have to use a knife or a fork.

153
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm getting dizzy.

154
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,720
I don't want to eat Japanese food.

155
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,280
Shall we have sushi then?

156
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,260
Sushi?

157
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,140
We have room service.

158
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,820
Really?

159
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,800
It's so expensive.

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,820
It's a hotel.

161
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,840
I'll take room service.

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
10 servings of special sushi.

163
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,000
A big order!

164
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,980
What did you just say?!

165
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't do such a disgusting thing!

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,520
Don't be so hasty!

167
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,500
Don't be so hasty!

168
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,620
Everyone has a TV station.

169
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,080
No matter how much you pay, you don't have to pay a cent.

170
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,460
Really?

171
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,240
Yeah. It doesn't hurt your stomach.

172
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,340
Don't worry.

173
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,480
But three people can't eat it all.

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,440
That's right.

175
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,660
Shall we call the next Gen?

176
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,780
Oh, that's good!

177
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920
The room is big, so it's better to have more people.

178
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,780
Then let's call the women's club.

179
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,060
Let's call the women's club.

180
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:17,900
Okay.

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,920
Then let's add sushi.

182
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,020
And let's get some good sashimi and alcohol.

183
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,360
No.18, I'll sing a song from Katsushika Rhapsody.

184
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll sing a song from Katsushika Rhapsody.

185
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,100
I'll sing a song from Katsushika Rhapsody.

186
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,340
I'll sing a song from Katsushika Rhapsody.

187
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,080
You can do that for free.

188
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,100
So you can spend the rest of your life at home.

189
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
Nagagawa, Raid!

190
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,780
I brought sushi as a souvenir.

191
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,080
I brought sushi as a souvenir.

192
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,520
I brought sushi as a souvenir.

193
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,480
I brought sushi as a souvenir.

194
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,940
Sushi is just a thing.

195
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,780
Oh, Chief.

196
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,840
You have such a scary face again.

197
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,540
Here is sushi.

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,220
Sushi.

199
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,120
What are you doing drinking booze while on duty?

200
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,180
What are you doing drinking booze while on duty?

201
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,000
Sorry, Ryo.

202
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,700
I couldn't stop lying.

203
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,060
So, what happened to the pot?

204
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,760
Pot?

205
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,160
Pot?

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,940
I heard you took the pot you left here.

207
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,800
I heard you took the pot you left here.

208
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,700
Oh, I see.

209
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,320
That's why I went to my father's house.

210
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,280
Did you forget?

211
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,600
Idiot!

212
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,860
That pot was supposed to be given to a guest from abroad.

213
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,160
That pot was supposed to be given to a guest from abroad.

214
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,380
I can't believe you.

215
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,220
If Ryo-kun doesn't make it tonight,

216
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,420
he'll take it.

217
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,460
If he doesn't make it by 9:00,

218
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
you both won't know what's going to happen.

219
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,320
Hey!

220
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,940
You make it so easy when you shoot.

221
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,840
You just forgot all about it.

222
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,660
You made it so easy when you shoot.

223
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,200
You made it so easy when you shoot.

224
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,800
You made it so easy when you shoot.

225
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,300
You made it so easy when you shoot.

226
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,960
5 seconds before the main event.

227
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,160
4, 2, 1, go.

228
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,880
3, 2, 1

229
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,460
Meow

230
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,260
The 35th Anniversary Special "Bella Vole"

231
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,960
Tonight is broadcast live

232
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
It's started, it's started

233
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,900
Mom, it's started

234
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,500
They're doing it, they're doing it

235
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,540
Dad, I'm on TV

236
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,920
It's really a surprise

237
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,580
What?

238
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,540
You made your favorite?

239
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,720
Bella Vole

240
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,640
He's a young man now

241
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,940
His hair is black and his ears are pierced

242
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,240
He's as fluffy as a cotton ball

243
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,140
You can't tell that to him

244
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,460
Dad, you don't have to decide so suddenly

245
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,760
That's right, dad is usually old

246
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,660
Humans can't judge just by appearance

247
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,500
Meow

248
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Shut up, kids and cats are quiet

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
So, what kind of man are you?

250
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm on TV right now

251
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,160
What?

252
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,860
Sis, hurry up, I'm sorry

253
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,860
Dad, you're right

254
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:42,520
Ryo, Ryo

255
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,660
Well, I'm on TV

256
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,900
He's on TV

257
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,360
Well, I'm a child

258
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,540
What's wrong with the boy's personality?

259
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,380
He is trying to get free

260
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,740
He can't say anything

261
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,560
I went to the hospital

262
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm sorry

263
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,660
Well, I have to go

264
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,140
Just like Kan-kichi

265
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
I'm here to see it!

266
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,620
I have no choice but to continue with the ad-lib.

267
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,140
Wh-What is it?

268
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,700
That curry is...

269
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:35,880
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Tadashi!

270
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,700
Now, please come up, Mr. Tadashi!

271
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,560
Ah, Mr. Tadashi!

272
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
I-I'm so sorry...!

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
Don't you think about it!

274
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Look here, as I told you to--

275
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,860
Nope.

276
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,020
I don't have a simple hairstyle...

277
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,620
Today, I'm like a man with a simple personality.

278
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,840
A typical Japanese man!

279
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,180
Ah, that's right...

280
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,480
Let's go, Mr. Tadashi!

281
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,060
Sit down.

282
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,680
Oh!

283
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,940
You're Mr. Omahari, aren't you?

284
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,540
Yes, I am.

285
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,540
I've been in charge of the police.

286
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,820
Right, Mr. Tadashi?

287
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,700
No, I've been in charge of the police for all the years.

288
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,300
Again?

289
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,200
Mr. Tadashi?

290
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,500
You're always like this.

291
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,700
You're always joking.

292
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,960
You're a funny person.

293
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,540
I'm on the air.

294
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,440
You can do what it says there.

295
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm not serious.

296
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,040
Director, it's my turn.

297
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,320
No way.

298
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,200
This is my drama debut.

299
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,400
You're done.

300
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
You're in the middle of a live broadcast.

301
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,160
One more.

302
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,560
One hour and forty minutes.

303
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,760
I have to bring that pot by 9 o'clock.

304
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,400
I have to do something.

305
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,980
What's wrong, Mr. Tadashi?

306
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,020
Nice to meet you.

307
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,100
I'm Tadashi.

308
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,100
Thank you, Mr. Tadashi.

309
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,020
Oh, no.

310
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
Oh, no.

311
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,360
Oh, no.

312
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,460
Oh, no.

313
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh, no.

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,380
Oh, no.

315
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,540
Oh, no.

316
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,020
Oh, no.

317
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,440
Oh, no.

318
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,880
Oh, no.

319
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,240
No, no, no, no.

320
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,260
Oh, no.

321
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,480
Tadashi, you're here.

322
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:53,920
I'll call you back.

323
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,800
OK.

324
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,860
Little annoying.

325
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,360
Wait a minute.

326
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,020
Hang on.

327
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,280
She's wearing a high dress.

328
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,120
You're gonna be a nightmare, Lee, for the rest of your life.

329
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,280
Go.

330
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,320
Don't.

331
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,040
You're gonna have to leave.

332
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,380
I don't know. But Ryo-chan is on TV right now.

333
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,340
It's a live broadcast.

334
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,440
What?

335
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,100
Next news.

336
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,000
That one?

337
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,000
Correct!

338
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,760
This one.

339
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,920
Dad.

340
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,740
It's true.

341
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,540
What's going on?

342
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,660
I have to keep acting to get the pot.

343
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,040
Well...

344
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,520
I'll show you how to make a great tsukudaniya.

345
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,180
What do you mean?

346
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,200
Give me that pot!

347
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,740
A pot?

348
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,600
That's what I'm going to do.

349
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,280
Wait a minute!

350
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,100
Mr. Tadashi, don't go!

351
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,220
Don't rush!

352
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,060
Let go of me!

353
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,100
I just want a pot!

354
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,520
Mr. Tadashi, it's me, not the pot!

355
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,580
That's right!

356
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,460
You came to get your dad married, didn't you?

357
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,520
I see.

358
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,620
Damn it.

359
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,980
Do I have to keep acting?

360
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,760
Shizu...

361
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,140
How do you read it?

362
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh...

363
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,580
Shizu and Baka.

364
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,560
Baka?

365
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,460
That's not it.

366
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,440
What the hell are you doing to my daughter?

367
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,360
You stupid brat.

368
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,560
You're always so mean.

369
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,560
I'm Yorozuya Shuzo.

370
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,520
You stupid brat.

371
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm Yorozuya, my father's last name.

372
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,080
My father's name is Ginji.

373
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,740
Shut up!

374
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm Tadashi.

375
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,260
Yes.

376
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
It's all right.

377
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,540
You stupid brat.

378
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,880
You two.

379
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,280
You're right.

380
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,960
Calm down!

381
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,020
Please!

382
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,900
Is it a commercial?

383
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,180
Alright, I got a chance!

384
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,320
What?

385
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,700
It's a movie!

386
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,720
I can't see the pot!

387
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,720
I found it!

388
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,360
What would you do in a situation like this?

389
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
You'd use a flashlight?

390
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,440
But I'm in trouble.

391
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,720
There's a lot of times where the battery runs out.

392
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,080
Even in those situations, I feel at ease with this Tohdai Jirushi's candle.

393
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,800
It goes well with birthday cake candles and Buddhist altar.

394
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,640
We hope you enjoy Tohdai Jirushi's candle!

395
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,720
This program is brought to you by Tohdai Jirushi's candle which is bright to the foot.

396
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,380
So they have a live show up until the commercial?

397
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,420
This program is brought to you by Tohdai Jirushi's candle.

398
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,640
I'm not going to give you a daughter!

399
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,900
Dad!

400
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,680
You'd better not say that!

401
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,640
Mr. Tadashi...

402
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,860
It's you, Mr. Tadashi!

403
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
I see.

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,920
What's wrong, Kiriko?

405
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,820
I'm not Kiriko, I'm Matsuko!

406
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,840
Is that right?

407
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,640
Yeah.

408
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,200
No, it's not!

409
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,160
If you're a man, say something!

410
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,740
That's right!

411
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,320
Say something to your dad!

412
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,300
Meow!

413
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,020
I'm not going home until you say you're going to give me something!

414
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,040
Stop it, you idiot!

415
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,840
I won't do it!

416
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
I don't care about your daughter!

417
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,160
It's just a candle!

418
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,600
Why don't you just listen to what your father says,

419
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,000
without being so stubborn?

420
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,140
That's right!

421
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,960
If you ask me to be sincere, I'm sure you'll understand!

422
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,100
I can't live without that candle!

423
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,940
The chief will scold me,

424
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,380
and I'll be left with nothing to do!

425
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,240
Please, I'm begging you!

426
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,760
Anyway, I don't need anything else!

427
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,340
I want that candle!

428
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,920
No!

429
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,280
Your daughter won't do it!

430
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,700
That's why I said it's a candle!

431
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,120
Give me the candle!

432
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,460
You're really getting close!

433
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,720
But it's already 8 o'clock!

434
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
You idiot!

435
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,520
Hurry up!

436
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,120
I'm going to miss the flight!

437
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,140
If you really want your daughter,

438
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,820
you better take her away from me!

439
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,500
That's too much!

440
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,600
If you're a man, take her away!

441
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,100
I can't stand this!

442
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,860
Dad!

443
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,260
Give it to me!

444
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,160
Shizuko!

445
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,760
Hurry up!

446
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,340
I have to hurry!

447
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,540
Stop it!

448
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,500
Hurry up!

449
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:04,800
If you do that,

450
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,680
and drop the candle...

451
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,280
Dad!

452
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:07,680
Hey!

453
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,180
Wait, Kouta!

454
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
This way!

455
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,880
Stop it, Takichi!

456
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,140
Don't wait for me!

457
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
The egg tower!

458
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,320
You're too clever for a cat!

459
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,060
Ouch!

460
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,800
You!

461
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
I did it!

462
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,140
I won't give it to anyone else!

463
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,300
Don't let me get away!

464
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,800
Kouta!

465
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,080
You're not getting away!

466
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,840
You're too honest!

467
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,520
Don't let me get away!

468
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,720
Stop!

469
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,360
Don't go!

470
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,800
Hey!

471
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,360
You can't tie up a bike!

472
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,000
Dad!

473
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,760
Dad!

474
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:51,800
Dad!

475
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,220
Dad!

476
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,000
Mom!

477
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,020
Dad!

478
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,340
Dad!

479
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,540
Dad!

480
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,260
Help!!!

481
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,440
Gotta get it done fast!

482
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,180
Shut it, you muddy old...

483
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,980
Ah, this is a perfect spot!

484
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,240
It's early to the exit!

485
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,040
We gotta put on our dry-coats.

486
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,500
Not sure about that, but let's get out of here!

487
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
You take care, old hen!

488
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,600
Let go!

489
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,980
This is going to be a huge development!

490
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm so hungry!

491
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
That's right, Kikichi!

492
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,180
I'll bring it!

493
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,900
Mr. Tadashi!

494
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,460
I won't allow you to marry someone like you!

495
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,380
You! Don't say that!

496
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,820
I'm a stubborn father!

497
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
Bring it here!

498
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,320
Shut up! I'll show you!

499
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,420
Let me do it!

500
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,980
I won't let you die if you end the live broadcast in the middle of it!

501
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,080
What a stubborn guy!

502
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,940
I'm screwed!

503
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,520
What should I do?

504
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,660
That's right!

505
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
Wait!

506
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,900
Mr. Omawari, you're going to be in trouble.

507
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,100
It's already the end of the show.

508
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,880
Oh, I found it!

509
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,380
Dad, give me this!

510
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,120
Yes, yes.

511
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,200
I'll give you this.

512
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,660
Well, then, 2,000 yen.

513
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,720
Chief!

514
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,940
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!

515
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,040
I did it! We're still in time!

516
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,040
Yes!

517
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,380
What's wrong?

518
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
Senior...

519
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,760
You know, Ryo.

520
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,300
I've been watching everything.

521
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,820
I've been watching everything.

522
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,880
The live broadcast...

523
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,460
The place where you dropped the pot,

524
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,960
The place where you bought the fake one,

525
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
The place where you bought the fake one, is perfect.

526
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,820
The place where you bought the fake one, is perfect.

527
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,540
You idiot!

528
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!

529
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,500
I'm sorry!

530
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,460
I'll admit my crime and come out on my own!

531
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,580
You're great, Mr. Tadashi!

532
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,420
You're a man!

533
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,640
You should respect me!

534
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm going to make better sacrifices, I'll get this marriage ready!

535
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,660
I'm going to make better sacrifices, I'll get this marriage ready!

536
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,540
Thank you, Tadashi!

537
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,100
Thank you, Tadashi!

538
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,620
Meow!

539
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,640
I'm not sure what it is, but this really moves me!

540
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,860
Kanna, are you going to make it?

541
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,000
Would you make it?

542
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,580
Would you?

543
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,320
Kanna!

544
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
You're going to make better sacrifices!

545
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,580
……………

546
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,480
……………

547
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,260
Augh! What!?

548
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,160
I can't believe this!!

549
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,340
Na na na as it comes,

550
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,760
Na na na as it comes,

551
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,180
Na na na as it comes,

552
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,800
To the one that's always playing dumb with looks,

553
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,260
I don't want to be someone who just fights for looks

554
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:33,680
If I make a mistake on the corner, the moon will run away

555
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:41,320
Because now is not everything, don't worry too much

556
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:49,360
Even if I lie and cheat a little, I sometimes help someone

557
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,840
Baby do you know me? I have a nice breath heading for tomorrow

558
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,460
Don't get sick, I'll do what I have to do, my cute breath

559
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,080
What's hard to understand is

560
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,660
I want to show you that

561
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,180
I want to show you that

562
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,280
I want to show you that

563
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,540
It's better than seeing it again

564
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,580
Na na na na na na na na na na na

565
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:31,120
You came again, Professor Tondemo!

566
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,800
What? Food crisis prevention with biotechnology?

567
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,080
What's this huge shrimp and crab?

568
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,960
If this thing runs away, I'll tell you it's ridiculous!

569
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,580
I'm running away from what I'm saying!

570
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,140
Next time, shrimp, crab, squid, the arrival of a huge biopsy.

571
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,880
Thank you!

572
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,780
There is a wall over there

573
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,580
Ah, there must be a wall

574
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town

575
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you!
