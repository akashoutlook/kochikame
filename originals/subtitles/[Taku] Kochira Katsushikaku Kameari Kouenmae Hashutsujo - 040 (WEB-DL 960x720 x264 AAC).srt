1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,600
Inhabiting the "Masked Girls"

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,820
From inside I look up at my shadow

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:23,000
If I jump over the pebble I'll be on the Moon

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,620
From the water tank of a capricious hat

5
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,100
To the taishakuten, the sunset falls

6
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,120
Tomorrow is already over

7
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,600
Katsushika, Shibamata, and happiness

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,840
I noticed it with a mark

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,020
Because I'm an idiot

10
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,040
Shibamata, Shibamata, and happiness

11
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,320
Lord Ryo, I'm going now.

12
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,360
Lord Ryo

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,480
Hey! Don't get in there!

14
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,980
No, Lord Ryo, you are embarrassing.

15
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,680
Please take care of us.

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,160
You're married from today, aren't you?

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Is that so?

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,260
I'm happy.

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm going to join you.

20
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,620
Ryo!

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,500
Stop it! Stop it!

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,040
Stop it!

23
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,760
It was a dream.

24
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,720
I had a terrible dream.

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,620
What?

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,910
What?

27
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,640
Good morning, Ryo.

28
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,240
Maria!

29
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,060
Why are you here?

30
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,780
I see.

31
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm still dreaming.

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm sure it's a dream.

33
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,800
Wake up! Wake up!

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,500
Wake up!

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,240
It hurts.

36
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,540
What are you doing?

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,860
Why are you here?

38
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,960
I have nowhere to go.

39
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,360
What do you mean?

40
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,000
I asked you to come to the same dorm as Ryo.

41
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,580
I asked you to come to the same dorm as Ryo.

42
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,460
But you said I couldn't stay here.

43
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,780
But you said I couldn't stay here.

44
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:41,980
Of course.

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,520
You can go to the women's room.

46
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,620
I'm a man, so I was rejected.

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,060
I was rejected.

48
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,640
I decided to go to your room.

49
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,280
Don't make up your mind.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
I can't do that.

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't look at me like that.

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,100
Don't look at me like that.

53
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,860
Don't look at me like that.

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,900
Only you can rely on the police.

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Only you can rely on the police.

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,300
What should I do?

57
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,120
Don't cry.

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,860
I know. I know.

59
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
Do as you please.

60
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,900
That's enough.

61
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,720
I can't help it.

62
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,040
Ryo, I'm so happy!

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,460
Stop it!

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,440
I should return this book.

65
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,960
I've been borrowing it for a long time.

66
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,940
Senpai!

67
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,220
Senpai!

68
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,260
Hold on!

69
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,980
Did I go to the wrong room?

70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,640
It's Senpai's room.

71
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,280
Who is it?

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,920
Um...

73
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,500
Hey, Honda! Come in!

74
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,360
Good morning.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
Who is that pretty lady?

76
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,700
Who is that pretty lady?

77
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,080
Get away!

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,980
I'm a member of the Katsushika family.

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm a member of the Katsushika family.

80
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,520
My name is Asato Iris.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,340
My name is Maria.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Nice to meet you.

83
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,580
I'm Honda from Koki.

84
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,180
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

86
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,600
Go ahead.

87
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,340
Is it breakfast?

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,420
It's breakfast for you.

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,420
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were so good at cooking.

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were so good at cooking.

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
I can make sake right now!

92
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,900
What?

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,220
Don't be a friend.

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,060
Try it.

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,140
It's really tasty.

96
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,980
I thought you were very good at cooking.

97
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,680
And you are so pretty.

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,560
That's a misunderstanding.

99
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,540
Okay?

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,040
What? A man?

101
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,640
Yeah.

102
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,240
Please don't tell me such a lie.

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Even if you're a senior, you're joking.

104
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,380
Senpai is so nice.

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,320
I wonder why I'm so selfish all the time.

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,980
Why does it always end up like this?

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,980
After all, I only have a motorcycle.

108
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,440
Senpai is so nice.

109
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,300
Don't be so mean.

110
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,720
Maria said you're a man.

111
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,780
Okay, come on.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,520
What?

113
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:08,540
What?

114
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,640
Maria.

115
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,320
Yes?

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,440
Ready, go!

117
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,600
It's so...

118
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,060
I forgot Maria was a former kickboxing champion.

119
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm really sorry.

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Honda.

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,320
No, it was my fault.

122
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,360
Maria, you can't fight anymore.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,360
What?

124
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,520
Listen, you're a former kickboxing champion.

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,900
You're a walking monster.

126
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,060
To protect Ryo-sama?

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,840
No, you can't.

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,800
Okay?

129
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, I'll do as you say.

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
She's so cute and honest.

131
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,400
But I can't believe such a beautiful woman is a man.

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
I don't believe it.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
I think so, too.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
At least, once I thought we were going to get married.

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,340
I'm always okay with it.

136
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
I know it's a little too short.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
But I like this feeling.

138
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,620
No, no, no.

139
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,420
Men can't marry each other.

140
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,180
Do you hate me that much though I love you so much?

141
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,680
It's not like I like or hate you.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,620
Well, well, I'm not that kind of man.

143
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,900
Senpai, I feel sorry for you not understanding Maria's womanly heart.

144
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,580
What womanly heart?

145
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,720
It's a man's heart.

146
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,740
Because I'm a man.

147
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,660
There's a reason why men are attracted to manly hearts.

148
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,540
It has a different meaning!

149
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
Ryo-sama, you're so rude.

150
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,880
I made you cry.

151
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,160
I'll make you think you're a woman.

153
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,780
I'll try to make it work for me.

154
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,100
So don't cry.

155
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm really happy!

156
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,180
I don't know if I feel good or bad.

157
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,380
Thank you for the meal.

158
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Well, I'm going to go and get Maria's room.

159
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,820
What?

160
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,900
If you think you're a woman, you can't live with her.

161
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,360
In the men's dormitory, women are not allowed to enter.

162
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,720
But...

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,380
What?

164
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,140
If we fight, the woman's dormitory will be closed.

165
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,400
Leave it to me.

166
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,940
I'll rely on you, Ryo-sama.

167
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:52,000
Did you really see that?

168
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,860
Yeah, it's true.

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,560
That's for sure.

170
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,780
I think it's around here.

171
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,760
Nice to meet you.

172
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
I'll move in tomorrow.

173
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,620
What about that?

174
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,600
If I can get along with you, I'll stop listening to that sexual oxen.

175
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,180
Let me go home and tell Maria.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sure of it.

177
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,140
Look, the iron-clad coach.

178
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,600
So he snuck into the police station.

179
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,840
What?

180
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,860
What are you guys doing here?

181
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,340
Want to be allies?

182
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,960
We finally found the iron-clad coach.

183
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,660
This is the hundredth iron-cladиныwaowe prominent town moments to people live with.

184
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,720
Iron-clad measles?

185
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,320
I want to ask you something.

186
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,700
Where did you hide the old man?

187
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,120
Old man? What do you mean?

188
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,960
I didn't hide anything.

189
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,560
You're just trying to cut my hair.

190
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,200
I'll have you answer with all my strength, Iwao!

191
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,580
Stop it! It's not me!

192
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm not Gantetsu! I'm Ryo Tsukanki!

193
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,320
No problem!

194
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,060
It's Suhiro Ryoko!

195
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,860
Where?

196
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,080
Where?

197
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,620
You're disgusting!

198
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,740
I have 10,000 yen bills...

199
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,200
Wait!

200
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,140
You always get caught up in this, Gantetsu.

201
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,140
Stop it!

202
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,980
Gantetsu!

203
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,280
He's not Gantetsu!

204
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,140
Gantetsu!

205
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,840
If you're Gantetsu, I have my own ideas!

206
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,340
It's Buffy's Mia and Miu!

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,420
Idiot. You can't get caught up in this.

208
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,320
Ryo!

209
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,640
We're so happy...

210
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,340
We're so happy...

211
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,260
We're so happy...

212
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,900
We're so happy...

213
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,440
We're so happy...

214
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,260
We're so happy...

215
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,480
We're so happy...

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,620
We'll win, Ryo.

217
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,020
I'm so happy.

218
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,300
Ouch!

219
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,020
Damn it!

220
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm sorry, you bastard!

221
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,980
Ryo-chan!

222
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,460
Ryo-sama!

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,580
What's wrong with your face?

224
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,380
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

225
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,200
Are you alright, senpai? What happened?

226
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,780
The 6 members of the Khenpo Gi suddenly attacked me and a man named Gan-tetsu Iwao by mistake.

227
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,180
He attacked me by mistake.

228
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,260
Is he the one who attacked Maria-chan?

229
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,080
Yes. He was my coach when I was a kickboxer.

230
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,840
I think his face looks like yours.

231
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,400
Yes. I think my father's school students attacked me.

232
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,800
School students?

233
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,020
My father is a budoka and he's running a dojo.

234
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
He must have come to find me.

235
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,340
Does your father know that Maria has become a woman?

236
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
He doesn't know.

237
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,960
You must be surprised, father.

238
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,380
He might be shocked and fall asleep.

239
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,040
Huh?

240
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,540
I found you!

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,920
I won't let you run away anymore.

242
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,440
I got a call from the chief.

243
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,740
You bastard!

244
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,320
Ryo-sama, help me! I don't want to go back to my father!

245
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,520
Don't worry. They haven't realized you yet.

246
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,320
What?

247
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,340
Come on, Gan-tetsu!

248
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,440
I won't let you fool the police officer!

249
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,640
I told you it was just a mistake!

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

251
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,780
Huh?

252
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,080
Oh, it's here!

253
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,200
The chief has come!

254
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:31,860
işi!

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,460
I remember this.

256
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,500
Isn't that a Wotosanri?

257
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,120
It's my father's car.

258
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,080
Huh?

259
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,620
I'm a budoka,

260
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,160
Asato-banda!

261
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,200
TAKAHASHI

262
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,860
Episode 2

263
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
They all appeared at a strange location!

264
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,060
What is that guys?

265
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,880
That was just a gank for us!

266
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
What an annoying nauce.

267
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,620
Danmuji, where are you?

268
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,900
I am not Danmuji!

269
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,980
This guy is not Danmuji,

270
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,580
I'm not a school teacher, I'm a student.

271
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,620
Oh no, they'll find out.

272
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,480
Mr. Fuku, what time are you working today?

273
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,580
If you don't mind, there's a French restaurant in Daikanyama.

274
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,860
Do you want to have dinner with us tonight?

275
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,580
N-no...

276
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,440
You're not taking the stickers with you?

277
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,800
I want your phone number too!

278
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,180
He's just making fun of me.

279
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,580
But isn't it normal to have dinner with your parents?

280
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,340
I feel like we've met before.

281
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,900
Didn't you go to Roppongi before?

282
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,440
Chief, please don't switch to Roppongi mode.

283
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
Go to Gan-tetsu first!

284
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,380
Oh, I forgot.

285
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,540
Hey Gan-tetsu, where's your son?

286
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,960
I told you it's not Gan-tetsu!

287
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,980
Your son is the one I just met!

288
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,500
What?

289
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,440
Ai, you've become a woman!

290
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,580
Yes, Father.

291
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,220
Oh my god!

292
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,020
Delicious spaghetti, lasagna, borscht, pizza, flatbread!

293
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,920
What the hell is this?

294
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,940
Chief, please be careful!

295
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,880
Please forget about me, Father!

296
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,340
What?

297
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
What the hell are you talking about?

298
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,120
I won't!

299
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,960
The one who made me the book is...

300
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,820
You!

301
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,400
Since I was a kid, I was a coach.

302
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,160
I taught him all kinds of martial arts.

303
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,020
Karate, judo, wrestling, kickboxing...

304
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,940
I trained him to be at the top of all martial arts.

305
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,120
I trained him to be at the top of all martial arts.

306
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,920
Then...

307
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,820
He became the president of the Hon-dara-kenpo instead of me!

308
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,220
He fought Andy Trafford at the K-1 Grand Prix.

309
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,440
He defeated him with a kick and a kick!

310
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,940
He made the Hon-dara-kenpo spread all over the world!

311
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,120
He was the first kickboxing champion of the plan.

312
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,840
He didn't just leave the house.

313
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,820
He became a woman!

314
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,960
It's a big shock to see your son become a woman.

315
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,280
Of course.

316
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,560
I don't know why he made you expect so much.

317
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,400
Ai, go back to the dojo.

318
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,360
No!

319
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,280
You're the only one who can take Asato.

320
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,860
My sister, Rin, is there.

321
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,200
She's a woman!

322
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,060
No!

323
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,120
You look like a woman when you're close.

324
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,600
You're not my son!

325
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,100
You're a pervert!

326
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,660
You're right.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,620
You're a pervert!

328
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,060
Ryo!

329
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
I don't want to go back.

330
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,740
Okay.

331
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,680
I'll protect you.

332
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,700
Ryo...

333
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,880
I can't help it.

334
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,980
He's an amateur.

335
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,820
But he's still a man.

336
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,220
I'll protect you.

337
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,000
Are you ready?

338
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,240
Ryo, what's your father's martial arts?

339
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll show you my martial arts!

340
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,480
Tsubanomai!

341
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,560
I'm not done yet!

342
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,140
I'm not done yet!

343
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,580
I'm not done yet!

344
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,020
Did you see that?

345
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Tsubanomai...

346
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,360
What martial arts?

347
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,760
Is this a fight between children?

348
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm too embarrassed to follow you.

349
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,340
I don't want to fight.

350
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
What are you talking about?

351
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,580
Take my second sword!

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,640
Hon-dara!

353
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,020
Stop!

354
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,100
Did you take it off?

355
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,580
You're pretty good.

356
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,000
How about this?

357
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,160
Ryo!

358
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,820
Did you see that?

359
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,640
Hon-dara!

360
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,260
I'll show you what a son does!

361
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,640
Don't mess with your father!

362
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,380
If you don't show him face to face...

363
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,560
It'll be hard on him!

364
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,280
I don't like you guys,

365
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,220
I'll make you taste the Hon-dora sword.

366
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,660
Come on!

367
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,920
Ryo!

368
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,420
Sashimi!

369
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,240
Senpai!

370
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,660
Ryo!

371
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,740
I won't hold back this time.

372
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm telling you!

373
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,540
I'll show you what I got!

374
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,480
My eyes!

375
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,020
How about that?

376
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,340
You bastard!

377
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,660
You used the old lady to make the Hon-dora sword!

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
You know what the Shutamachi way is, right?

379
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,080
Let's go, Shutamachi Kenpo!

380
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,440
I'll make you taste the Hon-dora sword!

381
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll make you taste the Hon-dora sword!

382
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,440
I'll make you taste the Hon-dora sword!

383
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,200
Ryo!

384
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,840
My darling.

385
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,600
Ryo! What are you doing?

386
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,640
Ryo!

387
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,860
Don't get mad at me!

388
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,120
Ryo is fighting for me!

389
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:22,940
Hey!

390
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't get mad!

391
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,200
Hey!

392
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,500
So it's finally Ryo's turn to have a girlfriend!

393
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,980
Ryo, I'm going to use it!

394
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,900
Tenryu?

395
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,460
Aye!

396
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,160
Shutamachi Kenpo Oji!

397
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,660
Otankona!

398
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,160
Aye!

399
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,420
How's that?

400
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,340
Great!

401
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,900
How dare you look at me!

402
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Let's go!

403
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,600
Okay!

404
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,840
Thank you, aunt!

405
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,700
Good luck!

406
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,780
I won't forgive you!

407
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,740
Sosui's eyes are burning!

408
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,400
Please let me go!

409
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,060
Sosui, please be strong!

410
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,580
Where's the iron-hide model?

411
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,460
Hey, you idiot!

412
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
You're not stupid!

413
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,220
Akabe!

414
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,780
Damn it!

415
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,480
Sosui!

416
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,380
Please defeat him!

417
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,920
This is bad.

418
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,340
What's going to happen?

419
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,640
Wait, iron-hide model!

420
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,960
Are you okay?

421
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,460
I'm fine.

422
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,680
Hey, dad!

423
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,280
Did Omawari come in?

424
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,080
Today's the first time the guests have come.

425
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,400
That's not true!

426
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,140
It's all right.

427
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,920
Be like Kim Taku.

428
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,320
Hey, what are you doing, dad?

429
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,520
Our guests can't be caught like this.

430
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,520
Damn you!

431
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,080
Got it, huh?!

432
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,940
Let's go,

433
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:47,620
I feel sorry...

434
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, the final is...

435
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,280
*Gasps*

436
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,140
*Giggles*

437
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,560
*Giggles*

438
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,140
You're done for!

439
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,140
You're done for!

440
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,720
*Gasps*

441
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,240
-Where are you? -Ryo-sama!

442
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,460
-Boss!

443
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,580
*Gasps*

444
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,740
*Gasps*

445
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,260
-G-gosh.

446
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,100
*Giggles*

447
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,660
-Boss! -Ryo-sama!

448
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,480
-Maria! -Ryo-sama!

449
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,960
You won, for my sake!

450
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,600
Thank you!

451
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,060
If I was a little more serious, it would be like this!

452
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,600
-Ai. -Huh?

453
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,340
I lost. Ai, I won't force you anymore.

454
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,260
Live freely.

455
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,080
Thank you,

456
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,980
Father.

457
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,760
*Gasps*

458
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,140
I'm glad, Maria.

459
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,320
Thank you, everyone!

460
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,300
I'm glad we talked in peace.

461
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,160
I'm glad!

462
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,840
-I wonder what's so peaceful.

463
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,060
-Geez.

464
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,920
However,

465
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,000
instead of that,

466
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,200
I, Ryo-san,

467
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,360
will have you

468
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,060
pass the Hon-dara-kenpo!

469
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,340
What?

470
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,480
-You all, get in! -Yes, sir!

471
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,620
Hey, stop it!

472
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,860
Ryo-sama!

473
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Stop it! Stop it!

474
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,700
Ryo-sama!

475
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,860
Stop it! Let me go!

476
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,980
*Gasps*

477
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,840
Ouch!

478
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,360
*Gasps*

479
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,700
What? What?

480
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,240
What?

481
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,640
You've been through so much

482
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
Hon-dara-kenpo

483
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,100
since you were a child.

484
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,900
I won't do that!

485
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,040
*Gasps*

486
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,540
Father!

487
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,980
Maria, do something about them!

488
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,520
But I promised not to fight.

489
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,760
I don't care about that!

490
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,180
Help me!

491
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,940
All right, let's go!

492
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,020
*Screams*

493
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,060
*Screams*

494
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,080
*Screams*

495
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,040
Ryo-sama, let's go!

496
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,540
I don't want to go!

497
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,700
*Screams*

498
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,060
*Screams*

499
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,340
*Screams*

500
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,680
*Screams*

501
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,900
*Screams*

502
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,520
Oh, Chief!

503
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,400
You can't hide it!

504
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,180
You want Yuko Asada's autograph, right?

505
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,520
If you don't mind,

506
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,320
I can take it and give it to you.

507
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,720
But,

508
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,340
the first love of the great actress,

509
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,580
Yuko Asada,

510
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,720
is Kanki-sama Ryo-tsu.

511
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,820
Next time, "The First Love is Ryo-tsu!"

512
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,640
Please look forward to it!

513
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,800
*Music*

514
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,160
*Music*

515
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,220
*Music*

516
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,620
"I can't fall in love with you."

517
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,920
"I can't fall in love with you."

518
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,360
"I can't fall in love with you."

519
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,020
"I can't fall in love with you."

520
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,180
"I can't fall in love with you."

521
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,460
"I want to run through the vast desert on a motorcycle."

522
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,480
"I want to run through the vast desert on a motorcycle."

523
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,720
"I want to run through the vast desert on a motorcycle."

524
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,040
"I want to be free more than a bird!"

525
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,040
"I want to be free more than a bird!"

526
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:58,880
"I want to be free more than a bird!"

527
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,460
"I want to be free more than a bird!"

528
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,800
"My lady's dreams change with the speed of a magnifying glass!"

529
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,380
"My lady's dreams change with the speed of a magnifying glass!"

530
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,460
"My lady's dreams change with the speed of a magnifying glass!"

531
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,140
"The dream of love and the love of the heart."

532
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,220
I'm sorry, wait for me

533
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
The future of the panorama

534
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,600
is so bright

535
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,540
You know it, right?

536
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm sorry, wait for me
