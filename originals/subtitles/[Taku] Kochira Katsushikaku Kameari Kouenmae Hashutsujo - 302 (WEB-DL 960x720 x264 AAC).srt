Nakagawa-kun's company is amazing.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,080
Running a real Orient Express...

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,500
I can't believe it.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,880
It's a dream to travel around Japan with this.

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

48
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,420
We're working hard as Nakagawa Group to let people experience the real Orient Express while staying in Japan.

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,980
We worked hard on this project.

50
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,800
You were invited to the special train before the opening.

51
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,140
It's a great thing.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,260
Nakagawa and his colleagues really helped out.

53
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,480
After this, please go to your individual rooms.

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,820
The room is...

55
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,280
Room 1 for me, Room 2 for Reiko,

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,680
Room 3 for Chief Ohara,

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,500
Room 4 for Senpai,

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
Room 5 for Terai.

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,300
What other men are invited to our room?

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,220
Room 6 is for my relative,

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,920
Madam Christy.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,200
Room 7 is for the president of Seikyuden Railway,

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,900
Room 8 is for veteran actress,

64
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,420
Miyuki Takamura.

65
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,800
Room 9 is for me,

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,680
Room 10 is for the princess of the forest,

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,900
Kurofutsu Osho.

68
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,720
And the person who was supposed to be the vice president of Yokomizo Seishi,

69
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,040
is in Room 10.

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,240
Yes.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,420
Excuse me.

72
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,980
I'd like to see your driver's license.

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,480
Huh?

74
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,560
That's strange.

75
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,500
What's wrong, Chief?

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Well...

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,040
You lost your driver's license?

78
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,920
I lost mine, too.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No way.

80
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,220
It's strange.

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
I should have brought it with me.

82
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,080
Please be strong, Chief.

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,500
You seem to be very generous to me every day.

84
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,240
What's the point of being a role model for a chief like you?

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,500
Calm down and think about it from the beginning.

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,320
What?

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,620
From your personality,

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,660
you should have made sure that you had a proper invitation when you left the house.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,180
Oh, that's right.

90
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,320
And when you were on the train at the station,

91
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,760
you folded it and put it in the parking lot, didn't you?

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,100
That's right.

93
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,780
I didn't have it.

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,460
But you were worried that you might drop it in the parking lot,

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,460
so you put it in your hat.

96
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
That's right.

97
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,560
I put it in my hat.

98
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,860
I didn't have it.

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,160
But you worried that your hat might be blown away by the wind,

100
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,780
so you put it in your socks.

101
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,840
That's right.

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,620
I found it!

103
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,140
That's good, Chief.

104
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,400
Ryo, you're amazing.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,760
You're like a great detective.

106
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,100
It's not that bad.

107
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,260
Well, I'm not as good as you.

108
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,500
The situation here is different.

109
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,380
How is it, Nakagawa?

110
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,940
Does it suit you?

111
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,740
It's perfect, Senior.

112
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,420
You're a great detective.

113
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,280
I'll go check it out.

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,560
Huh?

115
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,560
Huh?

116
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,600
A suspicious light.

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
What is it?

118
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,580
It's the hand of the head.

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,920
That's something to be passionate about.

120
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,260
Excuse me.

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
Are you hurt?

122
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,340
No, I'm fine.

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,480
Huh?

124
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,540
Something is falling.

125
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,400
Ah!

126
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,280
Huh?

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,860
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,900
Gotcha!

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,220
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,420
No, no, you're not.

133
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,660
Hey.

134
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,720
It's me.

135
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,040
Oh, you're it.

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,140
What's up, kid?

137
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,080
Let's go.

138
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,780
Huh?

139
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,160
Oh, I see.

140
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,160
Yum, yum, yum.

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,420
Ah, it's so good.

142
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,320
Ryo-chan, you should eat more calmly.

143
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,280
Even the world's best chefs are shaking their arms.

144
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,180
Please try to enjoy it.

145
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,980
That's why I'm enjoying it. Like this.

146
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,140
Rero, Rero, Rero.

147
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,600
Huh?

148
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,020
Is it off?

149
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
I can't see anything in the dark.

150
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,960
What's wrong?

151
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:54,980
It's broken.

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,360
My bag...

153
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,000
Ah, I don't have any meat.

154
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,460
Huh? Huh?

155
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,700
Ryo-san, you took my meat!

156
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,620
What are you talking about?

157
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,820
I don't have any!

158
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,780
My diamond ring...

159
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,140
You can't see it?

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,480
Yes.

161
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,420
I'm sure I put it in this bag, but it's nowhere to be found.

162
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,500
Hey, everyone.

163
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,800
Let's split up and find the train.

164
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,360
Yes.

165
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,760
I don't have any.

166
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,600
Me neither.

167
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,620
Me neither.

168
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,960
I don't have any.

169
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,460
If you don't have any, then...

170
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,080
That's an important item that the deceased master gave me for the first time.

171
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,900
If that's not there, then...

172
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,140
I don't have any.

173
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,380
Huh?

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,120
Ryo-san, give it to me.

175
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,940
This diamond ring...

176
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,740
Ryo-san that you gave me...

177
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:03,960
sampling for what I want?

178
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,240
No, it wasn't a diamond ring.

179
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,840
No, it isn't.

180
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,140
Ryo-san, help us with this?

181
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,460
To put it simply, that diamond ring was found in the car.

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,400
"I don't want to talk to you anymore!"

183
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,100
"Please leave this case to the great detective, Sherlock Ryozu."

184
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,940
"I will find the culprit, no matter what."

185
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,960
"Sherlock Ryozu?"

186
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,620
"Yes, Watson."

187
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,920
"Watson."

188
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,300
"Wait, what are you talking about?"

189
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,800
"I don't remember being told to be so generous."

190
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,580
"I'm sorry to say this, but we are police officers."

191
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,640
"Please help us."

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,760
"I'm glad you said that."

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,520
"Right, everyone?"

194
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,500
"Yes."

195
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,900
"Thank you for your cooperation."

196
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,700
"Ryozu, stop being so judgmental!"

197
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,120
"You are quite the boss, aren't you?"

198
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,180
"What?"

199
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,420
"Who do you think found the driver's license that you lost?"

200
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,760
"Who was it?"

201
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
"Well..."

202
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,220
"Please leave this case to the great detective, Sherlock Ryozu."

203
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,840
"I can't help it. I'll leave it to you for a while."

204
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,960
"The crime took place within ten seconds of the power outage."

205
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,360
"The culprit stole a diamond from the bag of Lady Christie's wife."

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,720
"At that time, he dropped the bag on the floor in a hurry."

207
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,320
"Therefore, the police officer who was not there at the time of the power outage,"

208
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,900
"and the waitress, Miss Terry, and the driver, Mr. Akagawa Kyotaro, may be exempted."

209
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,240
"Of course, the victim, Lady Christie, too."

210
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,120
"And we, the police officers, will be the four guests."

211
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,220
"So I thought about it."

212
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,820
"And I found a person who had a great motive in this."

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,000
"That is..."

214
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,820
"You!"

215
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
"Mr. Elari!"

216
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,100
"Are you stupid? Why did I..."

217
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,440
"The Nakagawa Railway and Seikyū Railway, which you are the president of,"

218
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,040
"were rival companies."

219
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,920
"If the media finds out that the diamond was lost on this train,"

220
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,680
"the reputation of Nakagawa Railway will be in a mess."

221
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,160
"No! Definitely not!"

222
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,640
"If you doubt it so much, then take a look!"

223
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,300
"All right, Watson!"

224
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
"Me?"

225
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,760
"You can find out."

226
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,340
"Excuse me."

227
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,360
"Go ahead."

228
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,160
"But Ryo, I understand your motive, but that's not all."

229
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,060
"There is evidence that it won't work."

230
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,060
"Evidence?"

231
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,340
"I heard it with my own ears."

232
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,420
"Just now, Mr. Elari was..."

233
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,920
"Damn it! I can't beat him!"

234
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,080
"You're right."

235
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,860
"It's not anywhere, Ryo."

236
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
"What? That can't be!"

237
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,720
"Did you find it, Elari?"

238
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,620
"Yes."

239
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,860
"That's strange. You said you were going to destroy it."

240
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,000
"That's because I told you about this bean!"

241
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,220
"A bean?"

242
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,480
"You idiot!"

243
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,180
"I told you to stop, Detective Hidori!"

244
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,920
"You're going to do this because you're going to find the culprit with your own method!"

245
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,640
"Wait!"

246
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,720
"Please wait a moment, Mr. President."

247
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
"This time, it was just a little bit too sweet."

248
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,400
"Next time, I will definitely find the culprit."

249
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,440
"I want you to give me another chance!"

250
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,800
"Ugh..."

251
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,360
"The crime took place in the middle of the night, when the lights were off."

252
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,220
"Then, why did the culprit steal the diamond in the middle of the night, when there was nothing to see?"

253
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,700
"No, the culprit saw everything."

254
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,580
"Because the culprit is you!"

255
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,300
"The Black Shirt Man!"

256
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,620
"Please investigate."

257
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,700
"Mr. Watson."

258
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,080
"Yes."

259
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,900
"Excuse me."

260
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,120
"I'm sorry."

261
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,100
"So, Ryo-chan, how did you find the diamond in the middle of the night?"

262
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,580
"I saw it with my own eyes."

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,780
"The Black Shirt Man was polishing his head with passion just now."

264
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,900
"So?"

265
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,920
"He changed the light of his head to the light of the time when it was off."

266
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,480
"Wow, you're so stupid that I can't even talk about it!"

267
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,820
"It's nowhere to be found."

268
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,260
"You big idiot!"

269
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,360
"You're making a big mistake again!"

270
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,660
"I'm sorry."

271
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,280
"Wait!"

272
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,200
"Wait!"

273
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,540
"You were just a little too naive this time."

274
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,360
"Please give me another chance."

275
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,580
"The guests on this train are all rich people."

276
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,480
"But why did the diamond get stolen?"

277
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,320
"The culprit is you!"

278
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,440
"Mr. Takamura Miyuki!"

279
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,440
"Please investigate."

280
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:57,840
"Please wait."

281
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,200
"Ryoko."

282
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
"What? Me?"

283
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
"Please investigate."

284
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,920
"I'm sorry."

285
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,060
"By the way, Ryo-chan, why is the culprit Mr. Miyuki?"

286
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,180
"I don't know why, but..."

287
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,360
"There's no one who's interested in diamonds as a man."

288
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,660
"Diamonds are women."

289
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,920
"How about the evidence?"

290
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,460
"There's nothing."

291
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,700
"There's nothing, Ryo-chan."

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,680
"You big idiot!"

293
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,820
"This is the third time!"

294
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,320
"Wait!"

295
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,860
"You were just a little too naive this time."

296
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,900
"But next time..."

297
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,480
"Shut up!"

298
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,180
"You're not going to be fooled again!"

299
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,140
"It's fine!"

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
"I'm going to find the culprit this time!"

301
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,120
"This crime was really clever."

302
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,140
"Therefore, the culprit is highly likely to be a professional who has been trained."

303
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,140
"In other words, the culprit is..."

304
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,560
"You!"

305
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,600
" verify the advisor on your interview."

306
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,220
"You're not even close to the Mr. Yokomizo,"

307
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,120
" flipped to a man."

308
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,480
"and surprisingly suspicious."

309
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,780
"You're like a man who says the chaos when he's painting."

310
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,760
"Then why didn't you tell me at first?"

311
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,620
"It's too suspicious to do, so I didn't tell you."

312
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,580
"You're the most suspicious."

313
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,400
"Due to a difficult time I was in the middle of it."

314
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,820
What's that thing that's all over the passageway?

315
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,180
Isn't that the tool to steal the jewel?

316
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,420
What's so funny?

317
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,240
That's the seven-tool of the detective.

318
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,400
The detective?

319
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm Detective Edogawa Poirot!

320
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,300
Edogawa Poirot?

321
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,720
Episode 9: The

322
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,580
It seems that it's my, Detective Poirot's turn.

323
00:14:51,300 --> 00:15:01,200
In fact, I was secretly looking for a request from President Yoko Mizu to investigate a case that might have happened in this train.

324
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,280
And as expected, the incident happened.

325
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,060
But don't worry. I will solve this difficult case and give it to you.

326
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,280
Thank you very much, Detective.

327
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,660
I was looking at the situation for a while because it was interesting, but it seems that there is no way to solve it.

328
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,840
What is this?

329
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,700
First of all, let's remember exactly when the incident happened.

330
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,660
Do you have a mirror?

331
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,840
I have one.

332
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,100
Thank you.

333
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,100
What's wrong?

334
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,000
No, it's nothing.

335
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Please be quiet.

336
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
Then, why did you come to the station?

337
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,080
Why? Why did you do this?

338
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,380
I see.

339
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,880
At that time, I was stuck in the back of the train.

340
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,660
Oh, no. Then I will be turned into a thief.

341
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,440
I have to do something.

342
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,780
Everyone, do you remember?

343
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,720
At that time, there was no one who did anything strange.

344
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,020
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,540
What? There was nothing in particular.

346
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,520
Then, there was no one who did anything strange.

347
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,160
I see. There was no one who did anything strange.

348
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,540
But the diamond was gone.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,420
Excuse me.

350
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:36,920
Excuse me.

351
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,360
How did you steal the diamond from this bag?

352
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,360
Damn it. It was just a little while ago.

353
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,460
How did the culprit find this bag with the diamond in the dark?

354
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,860
And how did you steal the diamond from inside?

355
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,080
This is very important.

356
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
Damn it. I was put in such a place.

357
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,620
In such a place...

358
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,100
Ah, you're the suspect...

359
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,260
Well...

360
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,420
Don't bother me. I'm going to keep looking...

361
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,480
Hmm...

362
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,400
Ah, I see...

363
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,020
*Sigh*

364
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,040
*Sigh*

365
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,940
*Sigh*

366
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,200
*Sigh*

367
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,980
*Sigh*

368
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,140
*Sigh*

369
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,640
Question 1

370
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,100
What is the motive?

371
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,860
Question 2

372
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,600
Question 2

373
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,180
*Sigh*

374
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,460
Question 3

375
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,320
Where does the diamond hide?

376
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,700
*Sigh*

377
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
*Sigh*

378
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,120
*Sigh*

379
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,800
*Sigh*

380
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,400
*Sigh*

381
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,220
*Sigh*

382
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,800
*Sigh*

383
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:58,840
*Sigh*

384
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,240
*Sigh*

385
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,740
*Sigh*

386
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,360
*Sigh*

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,520
*Sigh*

388
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:02,920
*Sigh*

389
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,360
*Sigh*

390
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:13,680
*Sigh*

391
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,900
What kind of possibilities can be imagined by the enemy?

392
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,060
If you think about it, you can come to a conclusion.

393
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,960
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard.

394
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,800
So, the most characteristic of this incident is...

395
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,040
Thank you for waiting.

396
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,640
Is it you?

397
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,860
Are you still reasoning?

398
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,420
what?

399
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,360
Do you know what?

400
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,040
It came to my mind.

401
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,200
This is the case of the famous detective, Sherlock Ryochi.

402
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,120
What?

403
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,860
Without motivation, there is no culprit.

404
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,840
So where did the diamond disappear?

405
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
No, it doesn't disappear anywhere.

406
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
In other words, it doesn't jump out of the bag.

407
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,980
What an idiot.

408
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,960
No, no, it was not in the bag.

409
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,900
Watson.

410
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,940
Yes.

411
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,040
Look it up.

412
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,540
Yes.

413
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,240
Yes.

414
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,980
Oh, it was there.

415
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
No way.

416
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
It was certainly just now.

417
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,860
I'm sure he was lost somewhere.

418
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,980
Now, this is it.

419
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,320
This is fake.

420
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,480
What?

421
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,380
This is?

422
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,100
How do you know?

423
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,840
On my ring, on the back side,

424
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,260
There is a picture of love from the master.

425
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,040
But there is no message in this ring.

426
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,140
What do you mean?

427
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,160
What's the matter, Detective Mei?

428
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,380
That's the end of it.

429
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,200
Huh?

430
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,260
You.

431
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,760
Wait.

432
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,960
By the way, you're the only one who hasn't checked your body.

433
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,420
I'm a detective.

434
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,000
Because you're a detective, you cannot say that you're not the culprit.

435
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,940
And what did the detective Nanatsu-dogu do on the road with that thing?

436
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,880
That's...

437
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,680
Watson, check the electrical circuit.

438
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,200
Got it. I'm going too.

439
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,080
Nakagawa, call the president of Yokomizu Seishi.

440
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,040
Yes, I'm calling right now.

441
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,940
Hello? This is Nakagawa Keiichi.

442
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,140
There it is! Ryo-san, the timer!

443
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,020
The telegram was made by a man.

444
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,880
Yes, the president doesn't know Edogawa Poirot.

445
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,300
The monster's skin has finally peeled off.

446
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,880
Edogawa Poirot, you're the culprit!

447
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,480
Who are you?

448
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,080
Kaito 1035.

449
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,040
Kaito 1035?

450
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,260
You don't know him?

451
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,100
He's making a scene in the world right now.

452
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,080
He's a gemstone.

453
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,360
He's a gemstone thief.

454
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,540
I'm sure he gave you the ring.

455
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
Give me back the diamond!

456
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,640
You're a liar, detective.

457
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,180
I was going to save time for the next station, but I had to be caught.

458
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,380
Farewell.

459
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,420
Wait!

460
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,540
Wait!

461
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,260
Wait!

462
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,400
You can't escape now!

463
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,600
Now, give me the diamond!

464
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,900
What a pain in the ass!

465
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,040
What are you talking about?

466
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,620
If you can get it, try it!

467
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,420
What?

468
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,540
What?

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,580
What?

470
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,500
What?

471
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,580
What?

472
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,400
What?

473
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,000
What is this?!

474
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,500
You chauffeur, no good!

475
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
What are you talking about?

476
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,160
I told you to stop!

477
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,900
Go to hell!

478
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,720
He was after me!

479
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,360
He was after me!

480
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
I helped you!

481
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,500
I helped you!

482
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,380
You caught him!

483
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,500
What? What? There is no case that can't be solved if it's Sherlock Ryo.

484
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,580
That's amazing, Ryo.

485
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,700
To arrest a criminal with a murderous intent.

486
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
It's a great achievement, Ryo.

487
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,900
No, no, it's not a big deal.

488
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,940
This guy stole the invitation from the president's house in Yokomizo City and pretended to be a representative and got on this train.

489
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,640
And he used a timer to turn off the electricity and took the bag of Lady Christie's white shirt.

490
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,760
But how did he look in the dark?

491
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,060
His glasses contained a infrared scope.

492
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,880
And he switched the diamond with a fake one.

493
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,320
But Lady Christie, who felt the presence of a person, turned away.

494
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,740
The bag fell to the floor and a fake diamond fell from the inside and got on the monk's body.

495
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,060
I stole it, so it got in between my teeth.

496
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,660
Thanks to that, I had a hard time so much that I put the diamond in the bag.

497
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,140
Ryo-kun!

498
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,420
What?

499
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,600
You got caught between my teeth?

500
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,700
That's right.

501
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,400
So you borrowed the mirror from me, right?

502
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,440
And you pretended to be on the phone and tried to get back secretly.

503
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,680
Oh, I saw a shadow outside the window.

504
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,980
That was a senior.

505
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,860
Ryo-san was the one who ate my meat after all.

506
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,720
Hey, no, that's...

507
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,500
Ryo-san!

508
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,120
Everyone is sharp!

509
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,880
What's wrong, Bujo?

510
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
The father of Daishike's grandchild is injured.

511
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,500
So he wants me to take him to the sports competition instead.

512
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,720
Leave it to me, Bujo.

513
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,280
I won't lose to this kind of bad guy if I use my body.

514
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,400
Next time, "Run! Student Sports Club!"

515
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,300
See you later!
