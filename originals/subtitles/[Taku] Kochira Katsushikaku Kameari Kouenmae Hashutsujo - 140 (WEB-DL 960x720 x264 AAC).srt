What?!

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,340
Tonchin Kankon was eventually turned into Tonchin Kankon.

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,260

It's terrible to leave me behind!

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,380
If you hadn't noticed, I'd have been left behind.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,360

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,040
Thank you so much.

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,940
Um, if you don't mind...

82
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,720
How about one?

83
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, I'll have one.

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,000
That's how we started dating.

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,040
That's how we started dating.

86
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,080

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,600
So, you've been stimulated by your female instincts.

90
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,440
Uh, well...

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,060
Kon-tan, you did a good job.

92
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,800
You're pretty and you're nice.

93
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,820
You're pretty and you're nice.

94
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,520
K-Kan-chan!

95
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,980
Anyway, you're so smart.

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,760
I'll be the one to give you the wedding ceremony.

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,240
So, when is the ceremony?

98
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,600
Uh...

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,060
What's wrong?

100
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,060
Kan-chan, I've decided not to give you the wedding ceremony.

101
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,920
Kan-chan, I've decided not to give you the wedding ceremony.

102
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,340
Why?

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,280
Actually, the company I work for is still in red.

104
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,840
There's no bonus and the salary is 20% off.

105
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't have the time to give you the ceremony.

106
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,620
That's because you're impolite.

107
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,040
But is that okay, Shiori-san?

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,240
But is that okay, Shiori-san?

109
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,780
I'm happy just to be with you even if I don't give you the ceremony.

110
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,180
You're making me cry.

111
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,100
I really did find a good wife!

112
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,500
Alright!

113
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,960
I'll give you the wedding ceremony!

114
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,060
Eh? K-Kan-chan...

115
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,720
Don't worry about the money!

116
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,760
But...

117
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,940
It's okay! Leave it to me!

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
That Conta, right?

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,060
So, lend me the venue where the master is.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,620
I understand the situation. But I can't just say it's free.

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,320
Yeah!

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,840
It's only for friends and relatives to attend.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,940
It's 50 people, but how much does it cost?

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,240
I can give you the wedding ceremony for free.

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
But the charity...

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,920
Well, it's only 20,000 yen for one.

127
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,400
50 for 20,000 yen?

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,920
It costs 1 million yen?

129
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm not joking.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,460
I can't afford to pay for it.

131
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,240
I'm so tired of it.

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,220
It's because you don't know the common sense of the world and treat it cheap.

133
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,060
Shut up, you idiot!

134
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,680
Even if it's a new year or a new year's party, you can't afford to drink alone if you have 5,000 yen.

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,340
You're such a jerk.

136
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,140
You're running to make money even if you have 5,000 yen.

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,140
You idiot!

138
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,980
Don't make the wedding ceremony a new year's party or a new year's party!

139
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,940
Well, it's true.

140
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,240
There are some souvenirs and photos of the anniversary.

141
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,100
Yeah.

142
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,040
Wait a minute.

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Hmm...

144
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,560
The 13th of next month will be a big disaster on Friday.

145
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,140
Kankichi, the wedding ceremony is not scheduled for this day.

146
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,320
It's okay for half the price.

147
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,540
That's okay.

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,180
Really?

149
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,900
It's a big disaster on Friday the 13th.

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,460
In short, you should have a wedding ceremony.

151
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,380
Okay, it's decided on that day.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,520
You can meet up with me later.

153
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,160
See you.

154
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,700
You idiot!

155
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,660
Why aren't you coming?

156
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,960
Damn it!

157
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,780
How bad of you!

158
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,160
Why don't you ask if Kansai will get married?

159
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,360
Isn't this place setup?

160
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,680
No, it's...

161
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,800
It's too much!

162
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,720
Practice makes perfect!

163
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,720
Master, you really are a genius!

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,800
That's how the master hired me to be the butler's servant.

165
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,580
Master, this is the episode that we promised.

166
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,400
Please take a look.

167
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,140
Th-This is it!

168
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,700
Hello!

169
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,520
Ryo-san, you really think you can win?

170
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,980
If I lose, I'll return half of my share!

171
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,060
But there are three former professional baseball players in the enemy team.

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Are you sure you're okay?

173
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,560
Even if there are a Maguire and a Saucer in the big leagues,

174
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,780
I'll never lose as long as I'm a skid!

175
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
Volleyball!

176
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,620
Volleyball!

177
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,140
Now you're a professional.

178
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,980
But to earn 500,000, you can't lose!

179
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,200
What?

180
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,600
What about the ball?

181
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,800
I can't take that kind of hit!

182
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!

183
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

184
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,260
I... I got it!

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,600
Out!

186
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,660
He's got a great spirit.

187
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,180
Ryo-san is different when it comes to money.

188
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,800
Two outs, two or three draws.

189
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,860
I'll finish you off in one shot!

190
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,880
He's the only one who's tough.

191
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
There's one draw open here, so I'll let him walk.

192
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,620
Hmph.

193
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,080
That's right!

194
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,660
Oh, my God!

195
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,220
What the...

196
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Yay!

197
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,340
If you want to win, call my physical strength company anytime!

198
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Hello?

199
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,260
Physical strength company?

200
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,280
No, it's not.

201
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,300
It's me!

202
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,620
It's Kasane.

203
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,400
Hello?

204
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:58,980
I got a call.

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,260
Yes, yes.

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,260
It's a baseball pitcher.

207
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,360
When is the game?

208
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,880
The 12th.

209
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,100
Wait a minute.

210
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,300
It's open from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.

211
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,800
Is that okay?

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Where is it?

213
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,160
Yes, yes.

214
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,940
I got it.

215
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,560
The bonus is cash, so you can deposit it in the bank.

216
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,400
Or you can prepare cash before the game.

217
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,020
Well, then...

218
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,240
Here you go.

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,560
From 9:30 a.m. to 11 o'clock.

220
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,560
All right, I've got the target amount.

221
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,360
You'll get my pocket money after 13 days.

222
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,280
You've started your business again?

223
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,460
Yeah, that's a little different.

224
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,480
I need to earn 500,000 by the 13th.

225
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,980
So I started a physical strength company.

226
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,340
Physical strength company?

227
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,760
It's for baseball, gateball, mahjong, moving, and hunting grass.

228
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
It's a company that attracts for a number of sports and jobs.

229
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,540
The company is a company that takes care of the staff.

230
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,040
That's a great schedule.

231
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,420
It's true.

232
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,840
During the day, there are also gate ball matches.

233
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,080
Look at this!

234
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,900
You've been wearing that shirt for more than 10 days.

235
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,300
No, it's the inside.

236
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,060
Body!

237
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,700
Look at this well-trained body.

238
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,440
Superficial physical strength and quick-release power.

239
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,100
A man is the main thing to earn money by taking care of his own body.

240
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,220
He's a very stingy person who loves to earn money.

241
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,980
It's strange.

242
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,380
You're always stingy.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,260
I can't say anything.

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,620
But I've thought about it.

245
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,680
It's a perfect business for my senior.

246
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,260
Right?

247
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,340
I started working and earned 250,000 yen in just a week.

248
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
What's the 250,000 yen?

249
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,480
Oh, manager!

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,240
It's nothing.

251
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,760
More importantly, the manager.

252
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

253
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,980
Are you okay with the meeting with the manager?

254
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,120
Oh, I'll leave it to you.

255
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,540
Yes.

256
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,620
That's right, Ryo.

257
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm counting on you for the judo tournament on the 12th.

258
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,740
I forgot about it.

259
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,660
Idiot!

260
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,320
The president said he was looking forward to it and going to support it.

261
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,060
You know what?

262
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,000
Win it, even if it's a small amount.

263
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,360
Got it?

264
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,060
Hey, it's free to win.

265
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,900
Did you say something?

266
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,660
Nothing.

267
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,880
Have a good day.

268
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,500
Good.

269
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,920
Nakagawa, when are the judo tournaments starting?

270
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,840
The start is at 12 o'clock.

271
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,060
If we win, I think the finals will be at around 5 o'clock.

272
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,260
Oh, no.

273
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,220
On the 12th, we have four games of grass baseball from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m.

274
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,580
From noon, we have a rugby game and a swimming tournament in the town.

275
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,600
And we have a ballet presentation and a golf caddy.

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,520
What?

277
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:42,580
What?

278
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,560
It's true.

279
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,000
No matter how much you lose, it's impossible.

280
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,320
No.

281
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,140
I'm going to do it because I've been told to.

282
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,920
That's the motto of Ryo-tsu Stereo Co., Ltd.

283
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,120
I'll definitely do it!

284
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:56,980
The end.

285
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,540
The end.

286
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,480
The end.

287
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,920
The end.

288
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,840
The end.

289
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,180
The end.

290
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,860
The end.

291
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:06,900
The end.

292
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:06,980
The end.

293
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,680
The end.

294
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,160
The end.

295
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,220
The end.

296
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,040
The end.

297
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,840
The end.

298
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,360
The end.

299
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,320
The end.

300
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,040
The end.

301
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,660
The end.

302
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,820
The end.

303
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,120
The end.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,540
The end.

305
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:26,960
The end.

306
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,980
The end.

307
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,780
The end.

308
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,520
The end.

309
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,160
The end.

310
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,620
The end.

311
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,420
The end.

312
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,100
The end.

313
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,140
The end.

314
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,540
The end.

315
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,080
The end.

316
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,500
The end.

317
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,580
The end.

318
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,120
The end.

319
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
I don't have time to be angry. Ryo-chan, change your clothes quickly.

320
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,720
The last match was an extension.

321
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,440
So, did you win all four matches from the morning?

322
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
Of course. If I lose, the price will be halved.

323
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,620
I didn't come out of such a simple match.

324
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,820
Don't say that, hurry up.

325
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,040
Then, we will start the first round of the fifth match.

326
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,340
Ryotsu, who is the winner of the Katsushika match, and Yamada, who is the loser of the Aoto match.

327
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,580
Let's finish this match quickly.

328
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,280
Start!

329
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,160
Clear!

330
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,580
One point!

331
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,860
That was fast.

332
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,320
One second was decided.

333
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,600
Senpai, you did a great job.

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,240
You did it, Ryo-chan.

335
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,080
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

336
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes, sir.

337
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,320
Ryo-chan.

338
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,460
You did it.

339
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,760
No, it's already started.

340
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,560
Ryo-san, you are late.

341
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,760
You have already forgotten.

342
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,760
It's a precious thing to do a job that takes money.

343
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,440
Ryo-chan, you are in the 50m freestyle of the men's youth club.

344
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,240
Are you there?

345
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,900
You will be disqualified if you are not here.

346
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,620
Yes, I'm going back in 30 minutes.

347
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,740
Don't scare me, Ryo-san.

348
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm sorry. My schedule is a bit different.

349
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm sorry. I apologize.

350
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,040
Wow, this is great!

351
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,780
I've become a fish!

352
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,340
"The strength of the strong is overwhelming. This is amazing!"

353
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,880
"You're amazing, Ryo."

354
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,420
"The next 100m freeway was at 1:30."

355
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,660
"Oh, is that so?"

356
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,560
"I'm a little tired today. I'll be back at 1:30. See you!"

357
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,120
"Ryo!"

358
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,580
"Ryo, aren't you here yet?"

359
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
"I told you I would definitely come."

360
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,960
"Hey! Sorry to keep you waiting."

361
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,980
"You're here. Hurry up and listen. We're about to kick off."

362
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,680
"Ryo!"

363
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,060
"Leave it to me!"

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,140
"Don't push me!"

365
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,440
"You're in my way!"

366
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,080
"Ryo!"

367
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,700
"I'm going to kick your ass!"

368
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,040
"I'm gonna kick your ass!"

369
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,240
"I'm gonna kick your ass!"

370
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,860
"I'm gonna kick your ass!"

371
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,580
"Ryo!"

372
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,700
"We did it! As expected of the human-based Ryo-tsu!"

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,340
"I want you to join our rugby team instead of being a spy!"

374
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,220
"Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!"

375
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,100
"Hey, what's wrong, Ryo-tsu?"

376
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,360
"Are you hurt?"

377
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,000
"What? I'm fine. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!"

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,080
"I'm fine. I'm your dear friend."

379
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,180
"You should rest on the bench for a while!"

380
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,500
"Referee! We're moving the players out of their place!"

381
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,160
"That team is strong, so we'll win if we show up!"

382
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,440
"Let's go! Golf is starting!"

383
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,260
"Caddy, is that your belt?"

384
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,420
"T-that's the safe one. Then, how about you, sir?"

385
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,620
"I'll hold this and do my best!"

386
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,140
"What? You're not going to carry it?"

387
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,540
"I'm not going to let you take it!"

388
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,180
"O-okay!"

389
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,840
"Then, everyone, you can drive the cart yourselves."

390
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,680
"Then, I'll see you in the next hall!"

391
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,100
"Wait!"

392
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,000
"Ryo-tsu from Kazushika!"

393
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,560
"Is Ryo-tsu from Kazushika here?"

394
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,820
"What? You mean the caddies for rugby, swimming, and golf?"

395
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,480
"And he's also going to be a volunteer for the 3:00 ballet performance!"

396
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
"He's going to be a runner, too?"

397
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,480
"That idiot..."

398
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,840
"He's not here, so he's in danger!"

399
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,560
"I'm here!"

400
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,900
"Ryo-chan!"

401
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,980
"W-what's with that outfit?"

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,580
"It's all because the road is crowded, so it's a pain in the ass!"

403
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,720
"Here I go!"

404
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,240
"One! That's it!"

405
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,320
"Wow, that's strong!"

406
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,140
"But that outfit is too creepy..."

407
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:35,820
"It's so bad..."

408
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,520
"What's that?!"

409
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,000
"Although it's for money, it's embarrassing to look like this!"

410
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,540
"Hey, Mr. Takemoto. How long are you going to look at me?"

411
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,500
"Well, well... Here."

412
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,480
"Sorry I'm late!"

413
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,040
"No problem."

414
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,920
"Wh-what? What's with that outfit?"

415
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,460
"Whoaa-!"

416
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm getting a little nervous.

417
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm getting a little nervous.

418
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,160
Are you okay, Senpai?

419
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,180
You look pale.

420
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,940
I think I'm having a hard time with my schedule.

421
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,500
I think I'm having a hard time with my schedule.

422
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,020
You've made it to the finals.

423
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,020
You'll win for sure!

424
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,960
Leave it to me!

425
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,720
The final round will begin soon!

426
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,320
I can't believe I'm facing someone like him.

427
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,040
Damn it!

428
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,100
Hajime!

429
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,400
I have to keep my stamina!

430
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,000
Rear!

431
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,060
Ryo-san, you're the champion!

432
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,720
I did it!

433
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,660
You're too big.

434
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,960
Senpai!

435
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
What's wrong, Senpai?

436
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,700
I think my back is flat.

437
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,860
You'd better not skate today and just take a rest.

438
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,960
Don't say that!

439
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,120
Your money is the biggest problem if you cancel the race!

440
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,100
You're not going to be able to swim if you don't get 500,000.

441
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,780
You're not going to be able to swim if you don't get 500,000.

442
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,640
You have to win in the last round.

443
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,420
Nakagawa, bring something strong!

444
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,460
O-okay!

445
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,920
Ouch...

446
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,100
R-Ryo-tsu, what about the award ceremony?

447
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,980
Please come out on behalf of the leader.

448
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,660
Ouch...

449
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,540
You're already at your limit.

450
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,560
I know that.

451
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,840
But a man's promise to say something once is something you can protect no matter what.

452
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,380
I'll participate as long as I can move!

453
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,780
I'll participate as long as I can move!

454
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,060
Rather than helping the pro, you're helping the money.

455
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,200
The 200m free-fall is finally over.

456
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,840
Who will win?

457
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,900
Damn it!

458
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,480
My back hurts, I can't get any strength!

459
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,860
Oh, yeah!

460
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,620
He passed it to the fish!

461
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,720
He won't come out again!

462
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,980
The second-place player is chasing him!

463
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,620
Oh!

464
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,580
He got away!

465
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,200
No good!

466
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,260
I'm losing consciousness!

467
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,420
Gonta...

468
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,500
You'll definitely get a wedding ring!

469
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,980
Oh, Ryo-tsu!

470
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,280
What a great start!

471
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,160
Who will win?

472
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,600
What?

473
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,460
What?

474
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,900
Ryo-tsu!

475
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,960
He won the 200m free-fall after the 50m and 100m free-fall!

476
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,140
Yes!

477
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,620
I won the first place!

478
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,620
Ryo-san, you're so lucky!

479
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,500
Ryo-san!

480
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,600
Ryo-san!

481
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,340
Oh!

482
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,500
He's sinking!

483
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,800
We have to help him!

484
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,880
I'll do my best, Gonta!

485
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,560
Ready...

486
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,060
Don't touch him!

487
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,020
Where did Ryo-san go?

488
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,760
He paid for the free-fall in the morning, but he's still clean!

489
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,820
J-j-just hold on.

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,820
We're heading to the hospital now.

491
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,880
He had a rough day yesterday, and he's had a bad back.

492
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,720
Now that you mention it...

493
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,940
It was my promise!

494
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,940
Um...

495
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,620
I came back today to get some words of thanks for Kan-chan at his wedding...

496
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,740
Is Mr. Ryochi here?

497
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,560
I see.

498
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,420
Kankichi, is your back okay?

499
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,060
If you had me give you a painkiller, it would be better than last night.

500
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,900
Even so, you're just a little kid, aren't you?

501
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,720
One ten thousand yen for one is a good deal.

502
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,760
Kankichi, how can I thank you?

503
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
You worked hard until you were a little kid.

504
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,380
Don't say that.

505
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,480
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole of the world.

506
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,680
You'll be happy.

507
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,500
Thank you.

508
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,560
Hey, Mr. Ryo, are you there?

509
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,260
Damn it, you came all the way here to complain.

510
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,360
Mr. Ryo, we didn't come to attack you.

511
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,860
Huh?

512
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,300
You're so mean, Mr. Ryo.

513
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,440
If you're working hard for this day,

514
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,780
you should've just told us.

515
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,620
Mr. Ryo, I'll get you fired up.

516
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
Hey, come on in.

517
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,120
Hey, come on in.

518
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Hey, come on in.

519
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,540
Hey, come on in.

520
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,620
Hey, come on in.

521
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:36,280
Even the Samba Team from the shopping district.

522
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,140
Ryo, I've been looking around.

523
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,100
Let's dance together.

524
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,100
Oh, you're happy.

525
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,520
Kanta, Shiori, come on in.

526
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay, let's go.

527
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,640
My back hurts.

528
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,280

556
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,340
I loved you with tears in my eyes

557
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,620
I wonder how much people can get

558
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,700
With such irreplaceable things in their lives

559
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,000
You are me, I am you

560
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:03,460
That alone was enough to fill me up

561
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,280
Just laughing at you

562
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,080
I felt that I was healed from all the pain

563
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,120
Next time on Laugh Family, Ebisu-kun!

564
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,060
Thanks for watching!
