1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,320
When you watch TV

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,260
Make sure your room is bright

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,840
And try to stay away

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,060
From the other

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,900
"The Greatest Dinosaur"

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,340
"The Greatest Dinosaur"

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,520
"The Greatest Dinosaur"

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,640
A day comes

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,320
And the sun

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,560
Shines over the river

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,480
And the stone

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,740
Flies into the shoes

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,340
And the stone

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,380
Flies into the shoes

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,480
I'm going to

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,580
Go to the gym

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,260
I wonder if I'm going to

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,940
I was laughed at

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,580
I was laughed at

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,140
Even if I try

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,920
To cheer up

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,080
I can't win

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,100
I can't win

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,800
There may be

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,100
Unuko

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,180
There may be

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,080
Unuko

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,200
In that

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Gap

30
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,580
In that

31
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,480
Sleeping Gap

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Sun

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,040
Sun

34
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,280
Sun

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,680
If you

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,000
If you

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,540
If you

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,520
I realized I lost my happiness

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,680
Because I'm such an idiot

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,800
Maria, let's go on a date!

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,780
Congratulations!

42
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,820
Congratulations, senpai!

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,660
Be happy, Maria-chan!

44
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm so jealous!

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Ryo, spring has finally come for you!

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,120
Listen, you can't talk about Maria no matter what happens!

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
I know, chief!

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,460
Ryo, I'm too happy to be scared.

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,060
I agree.

50
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,360
Ryo...

51
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,580
Maria...

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Maria, what's wrong with you?

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,720
Maria, what's wrong with you?

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,080
Oh, my!

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,120
Men are the best when they are wearing six-legged.

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,720
Men are the best when they are wearing six-legged.

57
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,460
Man?

58
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,340
Oh, no!

59
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,080
Maria is a man!

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,140
Maria is a man!

61
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,180
Ryo!

62
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,320
I'll never leave you!

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,640
Stop it! Let me go!

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,680
Help!

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,880
What?

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,400
What's this? A dream?

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,020
What are you going to do this time?

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,660
Go to hell!

69
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,660
Good morning, Ryo-sama.

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,640
Good morning.

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,360
Good morning.

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
What's wrong?

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,300
*Gasp*

74
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:56,680
*Groans*

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Well, it's ready!

76
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,600
Ryo-sama, please have breakfast!

77
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,000
*Cough*

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,060
*Groans*

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,400
Oh!

80
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,160
Here you go!

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,920
Thank you!

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,900
*Groans*

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,780
*Groans*

84
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,700
*Groans*

85
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,640
*Groans*

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,100
*Groans*

87
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,260
*Groans*

88
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,680
*Groans*

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,240
Here you go, Ryo-sama.

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,020
*Groans*

91
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,660
*Groans*

92
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,080
*Groans*

93
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,560
Wasn't the miso soup too thick?

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,200
No, it was just right.

95
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,640
How was the pickles? Did they suit your taste?

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
I made them myself.

97
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,560
Yeah, they were delicious!

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm so glad.

99
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,860
I'm so glad! I'm so happy that you're happy!

100
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,720
*Groan*

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,160
*Groan*

102
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
*Groan*

103
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
No, you're not!

104
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,120
Why are you in my room?

105
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,300
I can't go.

106
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,100
I can't live with you.

107
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,840
Of course you can't!

108
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,620
Why?

109
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,560
Why can't you go, Ryo-sama?

110
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
Because...

111
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,280
Because...

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,460
Because you're a man, Maria!

113
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,520
*Groan*

114
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,580
*Groan*

115
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,020
*Groan*

116
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,540
You're so cruel, Ryo-sama.

117
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,600
Why is it so cruel that you don't let me live with you?

118
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,220
*Groan*

119
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,120
*Groan*

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
*Groan*

121
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,660
Actually, I've talked to Komachi-san and Naoko-san.

122
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,620
Actually, I've talked to Komachi-san and Naoko-san.

123
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,420
I've been with Ryo-sama for over a year now,

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:36,860
I've been with Ryo-sama for over a year now,

125
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,400
but he's still not getting along at all.

126
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,520
But how can he understand my feelings?

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,860
But how can he understand my feelings?

128
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:43,980
But how can he understand my feelings?

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,280
Hmm, so you really like that primitive man.

130
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,920
Of course, I do.

131
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,520
When I think about Ryo-sama,

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,520
my heart almost breaks,

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
and it's so painful and painful.

134
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,620
It's bad for Maria,

135
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,760
but we don't know it at all.

136
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey, what's so good about that man?

137
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,220
Everything!

138
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,700
He's so manly and has a lot of life!

139
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,940
His legs are so short and his face is so big!

140
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,380
His legs are so short and his face is so big!

141
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,060
He's short and thick,

142
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:28,420
Can you please be serious?

143
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,780
Please be serious!

144
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,120
I'm seriously worried!

145
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm seriously worried!

146
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,060
How do I make him decide?

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,940
I guess we have to be more orthodox.

148
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,420
Orthodox?

149
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,860
Like cooking for him.

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Or sewing his sweater.

151
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,180
Or we could force him to do something.

152
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,640
Yeah, like "pushing-and-pushing-girlfriend."

153
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,140
"Pushing-and-pushing-girlfriend"?

154
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,500
Maybe he'll forget that Maria is a man and start to roll around.

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,120
Roll around?

156
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah, like "pushing, pushing, pushing."

157
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,240
Yes, I'll try it!

158
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,920
That's what it's all about.

159
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,240
They're just blowing in nonsense!

160
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,920
Lord Ryo, I'm a bit of a coward, but I'm counting on you!

161
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,740
Here, your lunch.

162
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,220
Have a good day!

163
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,200
Have a good day!

164
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,300
Grandma's

165
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,320

Z

182
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,980
Then, why don't you make up your mind?

183
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,220
What do you mean, "make up my mind"?

184
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,940
Of course, I'm ready to get married, Ryo-tsu.

185
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,240
Even the director doesn't know that!

186
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,460
You know that, don't you? Maria is a man.

187
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Oh, Maria is more like a woman than a real girl.

188
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,980
That's right, Senpai.

189
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,260
It's so strange to see Maria's way of living with her seniors.

190
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,260
I wonder if anyone who's willing to come to Ryo-chan's place to get married will show up next year.

191
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm not saying it's a guess.

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,340
No, this is your only chance.

193
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,900
Ryo-tsu, don't worry about the details.

194
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,260
I'm thinking it's time for us to get married.

195
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,660
I'm not kidding.

196
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,820
I don't have a bad feeling about that.

197
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,220
Oh, Ryo-san.

198
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,480
Hey, Plum.

199
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,480
We're finally married.

200
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,220
What?

201
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,360
Who said that?

202
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,600
I-I think it was a girl from Minipot.

203
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,260
That's Naoko Komachi.

204
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
They're a bunch of useless people.

205
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,320
Thank you.

206
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,020
Ryo-chan, I heard you got married.

207
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,260
That's why I said no!

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,300
Ryo-sama!

209
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Ryo-sama!

210
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,760
Maria, you're so mean!

211
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,900
We're bound to meet Ryo-sama here.

212
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,340
We're bound to meet the god of love.

213
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,140
What? You're exaggerating.

214
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,960
You're exaggerating.

215
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,840
What?

216
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,060
You're married, aren't you, Ryo-san?

217
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,160
You're making me blush.

218
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,780
You're not Maria, are you?

219
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,200
You're such a waste.

220
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,300
You're such a waste. You're such a waste.

221
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,140
You didn't do it, you're wrong, Plum.

222
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,920
Yeah. I didn't do it, I know, but .

223
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,240
That's so dramatic!

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
Maria, come here and see what I'm saying.

225
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,580
Yes, everyone.

226
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,280
How are you?

227
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,920
Hello, I'm Ryo-san.

228
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,180
inhabit me happily.

229
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,640
Maria, do you have the right to hug him?

230
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,920
I'm so sorry, ryo-sama.

231
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
I was so happy about that.

232
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,320
By the way, you don't mind sukiyaki?

233
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,880
Sukiya- inspect?

234
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,460
What?

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Ryo-sama think me so, I'm really satisfied with that.

236
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,760
So I go there and order sukiyaki.

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,000
I bought some good stuff.

238
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,880
Please come home early today.

239
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,540
Sukiyaki?

240
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,840
You haven't eaten for a while.

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
Get me a beer.

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,760
Okay.

243
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,580
I'm waiting for you to come home, Ryo-sama.

244
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,720
Don't hug me.

245
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,220
Okay.

246
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,560
I feel like I'm getting into Maria's pace.

247
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,900
Hey, you're always together in the morning.

248
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,800
Miss,

249
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,520
Where do you like this guy?

250
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,120
Leave him alone and come with us.

251
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,680
I'll take you to a fun place.

252
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,420
You're so naughty.

253
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,020
You're a waste of a man like this.

254
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,440
You little brat!

255
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,160
Shut up!

256
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,880
Ryo-sama! Don't look!

257
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,840
Get him!

258
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,820
You!

259
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,740
Get him!

260
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,060
Get him!

261
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,780
You little brat!

262
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,620
Give him to me!

263
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,340
Don't get so angry!

264
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,840
Ryo!

265
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,100
I'll beat you up.

266
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,240
Ryo!

267
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,840
Get him!

268
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,580
Ryo!

269
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,160
She's my wife.

270
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,320
She's my wife.

271
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,240
She's my wife.

272
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,180
Shut up.

273
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,920
I'm just saying that I like her.

274
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,940
Yeah, that's right.

275
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,360
I mean, you're a towe.

276
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,580
Wanna know what I mean?

277
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,940
I said we're not a couple!

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
I've been in the office for 3 hours.

279
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,280
I don't like it at all.

280
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,460
It's all Maria's fault.

281
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,940
I have to tell her.

282
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,640
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

283
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,760
I don't like it.

284
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,760
Ryo-sama, welcome back.

285
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,100
Would you like to take a bath? Or do you want to eat first?

286
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,840
I've prepared sukiyaki.

287
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,340
Sukiyaki! Meji! Meji first!

288
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,120
Yes!

289
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,300
Sukiyaki, sukiyaki, I'm so happy!

290
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,880
Ryo-sama, before that, I'd like you to take a look at something.

291
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,580
What is it?

292
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,160
I've been thinking about wearing it with you.

293
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,780
Stop it. You can't wear something like that.

294
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,540
Why not?

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,580
It's strange for men to wear something like that.

296
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,100
Men, men, Ryo-sama, that's all.

297
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,720
Don't say such a small thing.

298
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,140
It's not small!

299
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
That's right, Maria. You are a man.

300
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,300
You have a lot of power.

301
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,180
Thanks to you, I've caused you a lot of trouble.

302
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,420
Trouble?

303
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,260
That's right.

304
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,320
It's a big trouble.

305
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,080
I understand.

306
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,920
If you say so, I will never use this stupid power again.

307
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,360
All right.

308
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,160
Then, if you use that stupid power again,

309
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,360
I'll have you leave this place immediately.

310
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,520
All right?

311
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,480
I understand, Ryo-sama.

312
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,360
Stupid power is never...

313
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,260
Stop!

314
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,520
I told you not to use stupid power!

315
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,460
I'm sorry, Ryo-sama.

316
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,600
But the cockroach...

317
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,060
I won't listen to excuses.

318
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,460
Get out of here right now!

319
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,920
Ryo-sama...

320
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,540
I don't know if it's because of your stupid power that everyone is bothering you.

321
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,540
If you say get out of here, get out of here!

322
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,920
I understand.

323
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,680
Then I'll leave.

324
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,040
Ryo...

325
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,900
I love you.

326
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,520
I love you.

327
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,640
Ryo...

328
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
I love you.

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,360
I love you, too.

330
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,620
I love you too.

331
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,740
type,

332
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,280
I wonder if the ambush strategy worked.

333
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
Maria, are you there?

334
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,120
Yes, I'm outside.

335
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,020
I finally found you.

336
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,940
Maria.

337
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,280
Reiko.

338
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,720
Can you help me?

339
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,860
Maria is here.

340
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,720
I'm glad.

341
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,700
What is it?

342
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,340
The locker is old, so I want to move it.

343
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,560
Maria, it's easy, right?

344
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,900
Yes.

345
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

346
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

347
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,400
I told you not to use your stupid strength!

348
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,220
I can't do it.

349
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,360
Maria.

350
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,540
How is it? It looks like a figure, right?

351
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
It really looks like you.

352
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,300
You have a good eye.

353
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,820
What is it?

354
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,340
Do I look like that guy?

355
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,540
Shut up!

356
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,100
This is Detective Otsuka, the drug investigator of the main office.

357
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,960
Drug investigator?

358
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Yes.

359
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,080
You look like a drug dealer who is on a mission.

360
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,840
Please help the investigation.

361
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,500
I want to block the trading site and make the smuggling organization a big hit.

362
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,080
Listen, Ryo.

363
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,580
You're the only one who can do this job.

364
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,620
I'll give you a small new machine.

365
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,420
I'll leave it here for 24 hours.

366
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,760
If you can find the trading site, please contact me immediately.

367
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,920
It's already closed.

368
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,140
What?

369
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
The information we have is under the protection of JR.

370
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,760
The password is GONZALEZ.

371
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,960
GONZALEZ?

372
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,200
GONZALEZ.

373
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,260
It seems that the contact with the members of the organization was successful.

374
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,740
The next day

375
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,780
The next day

376
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,160
The next day

377
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,800
The next day

378
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,500
Chief, this is Mr. Yamashita, the new member of the group.

379
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,860
Nice to meet you.

380
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
Nice to meet you.

381
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,860
Well then, let's go.

382
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,160
Hey, that guy.

383
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,220
Hey, turn the car.

384
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,260
The other day...

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Iguchi. I have something to talk to you.

386
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,900
Actually, the other day...

387
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,460
Hello.

388
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,620
Hey, Saeki.

389
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,860
By the way, Mr. Yamashita.

390
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,800
Yes.

391
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,700
What are you doing?

392
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
I knew you were around at that time.

393
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,860
It was a pity.

394
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,500
I just got in touch with the real Mr. Yamashita.

395
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,740
Damn it!

396
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,960
Damn it!

397
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,560
Damn it!

398
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,260
Damn it!

399
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:08,700
Damn it!

400
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,800
Damn it!

401
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,040
Damn it!

402
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,440
Yes, something like this.

403
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,860
Damn it!

404
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,260
Damn it!

405
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,620
He found out about it.

406
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,380
He is in danger, let's step in.

407
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,680
No, I can't do that.

408
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,080
They are just above the order to contain the transaction.

409
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,060
No, I can't do that. They are just above the order to contain the transaction.

410
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,500
No, I can't do that.

411
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,780
Don't worry about it.

412
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,000
- - I

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
see. You're a good looker. You

414
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,920
're a fool. Huh?

415
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,440
These are

416
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
the places we can think of as the trading places. If we

417
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,020
do this, we'll have to kill them all. But if

418
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,740
we go to the main gate, we'll find them. We'll

419
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,540
do it ourselves. - Okay?

420
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,500
- Yes!

421
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,940
- - Maria!

422
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,700
- - I

423
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:52,780
think it's all right because it's Ryo-chan. - - That

424
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,100
's true.

425
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,880
All we have to

426
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,900
do is finish this guy off. Let's do it

427
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,120
after we've fried him a bit more. - - It's

428
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,600
pretty quiet.

429
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,940
- - Maria,

430
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,120
we can't do this. We can

431
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,860
't. - - R

432
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,020
yo-

433
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
sama hates us for being so hard on him. That's right.

434
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,340
I wonder if this

435
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,560
is the right place. - - Huh?

436
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,020
is this

437
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,400
thread?

438
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
- - This... - - It

439
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,060
's the

440
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,560
made for

441
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,760
Ryo-sama. - - Ryo-sama,

442
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,240
you're

443
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,560
wearing it. - - Are you sure?

444
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,080
yo-

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:58,620
chan, I've taken off the sweater under the jumper to let us know. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

446
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,860
*Dun Dun*

447
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,920
*Dun Dun*

448
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,260

*Dun Dun*

457
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,480
Mr. Yamashita, are you tired?

458
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,720
Not yet.

459
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,220
Big brother!

460
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,300
Kumi-chan!

461
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,880
What's up?

462
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,020
A woman with great power has entered!

463
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,640
Woman?

464
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,220
I can't beat her! Let's run away!

465
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,560
Alright, let's take care of her.

466
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,380
*Dun Dun*

467
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,060
*Dun Dun*

468
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,460
*Dun Dun*

469
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,140
*Dun Dun*

470
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,240
*Kumi-chan!*

471
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,760
*Dun Dun*

472
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,860
*Dun Dun*

473
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,060
*Dun Dun*

474
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,520
*Dun Dun*

475
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,540
Mr. Ryo!

476
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,080
Where are you?

477
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,640
Mr. Ryo!

478
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,640
*Dun Dun*

479
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,440
*Dun Dun*

480
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
*Dun Dun*

481
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,060
*Dun Dun*

482
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,420
*Dun Dun*

483
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:08,600
*Dun Dun*

484
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,800
*Dun Dun*

485
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,860
*Dun Dun*

486
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,200
*Dun Dun*

487
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,240
*Dun Dun*

488
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,420
*Dun Dun*

489
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,280
Get with him!

490
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,160
If you get any closer, I'll kick him out of here!

491
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,540
Now, right now!

492
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,840
Maria, stop the helicopter!

493
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,840
Shut up!

494
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,740
Maria...

495
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,360
Ryo-sama! I'm sorry! I used the power of a fool that you hate!

496
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,300
Maria...

497
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,820
Maria, I forgive you! Use your power to knock that helicopter down!

498
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,760
Yes, Ryo-sama!

499
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,280
Fire!

500
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,900
You did it, Maria!

501
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,820
If you keep doing that, you'll end up as a perfect couple!

502
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,640
R-Rego, you idiot! What are you talking about?

503
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,180
Because you were really worried about Ryo-chan!

504
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,100
I won't ever leave Ryo-sama again!

505
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,940
Maria, you did a great job for Ryo-chan.

506
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,340
After all, the power of love is so strong.

507
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,020
That's right! My power is not the power of a fool, but the power of love, Ryo-sama!

508
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,760
What are you talking about?

509
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,840
I mean, don't hug me! Get away from me!

510
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm a man! I don't have that kind of power!

511
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,760
In front of the power of love, that's a trivial matter!

512
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,940
It's not a trivial matter!

513
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,460
I'm not an alien!

514
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,720
You're a pervert!

515
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,560
What, is that so?

516
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,580
It's just that I'm an alien.

517
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,840
From now on, I won't let you do such a thing!

518
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,460
Maria!

519
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,340
