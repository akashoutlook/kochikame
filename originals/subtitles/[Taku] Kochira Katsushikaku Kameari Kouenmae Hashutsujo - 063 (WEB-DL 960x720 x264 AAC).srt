00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,480
『GaruGaru』

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,080
『GaruGaru』

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,500
中川に浮かぶ夕日をめがけて 中川に浮かぶ夕日をめがけて

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:29,980
砲石を蹴ったら靴まで飛んで 砲石を蹴ったら靴まで飛んで

5
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,980
From the top of the mountain, to the top of the mountain, the sun sets

6
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,720
Tomorrow will end like this, won't it?

7
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,340
If you win or lose, you lose happiness again

8
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,400
I realized, because I'm such an idiot

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,060
Because I'm such an idiot

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,140
There's no bicycle. That means…

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,600
Lucky! You're on patrol with Ryo!

12
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,900
Nao, you're so happy!

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,680
Let's finish it while the idiot is gone.

14
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,460
Cheers!

15
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,720
We're from the Katsushika branch, Aoshin.

16
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,720
Oh, you're early.

17
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Is Aoshin the one you put up on the library's corridor?

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,420
That's right!

19
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,600
We deliver at your request.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,840
It's a newspaper that's very popular among the police officers of the Katsushika branch.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Oh, I've seen it before.

22
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,880
And today?

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,220
We're here to interview Reiko Akimoto!

24
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,440
We're going to show her uniform on the paper.

25
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,880
Reiko, please.

26
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay. I'll go change in the back, so wait a minute.

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,000
Excuse me, come on.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,320
As I thought, it's bad, Senpai.

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,740
Don't make a noise, fool.

30
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,580
I wonder when you got this poster.

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,780
It's a rather unnatural poster.

32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,600
It's just my imagination.

33
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,360
There you go.

34
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,660
I-it's terrible, Sen-Senpai.

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,700
Ouch...

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,500
Ryo!

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,700
Hey, Reiko! What are you doing here?

39
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,700
That's my line!

40
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,020
"I hate to take a woman's chance!"

41
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,880
Don't say that!

42
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,540
I was just in the classroom with Honda,

43
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,120
and you came in and tried to take off your clothes!

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,660
That's a painful excuse.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,520
What?

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,440
Reiko, what's wrong?

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,380
I heard a strange noise.

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,660
I'll open it.

49
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,460
Here you go.

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,600
Ah! Ryo Kamakichi!

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,760
Hi!

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,300
What's wrong?

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,480
What happened?

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,780
I saw you!

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,140
What?

56
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,060
I said I was wrong!

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,340
I thought you were listening to the interview.

58
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,460
You're a pervert!

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,000
You're a pervert!

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
It's a misunderstanding! It's really a misunderstanding!

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,880
Then what's that camera?

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
No, it's just...

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,900
What's this?

64
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,780
What's that?

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,340
It's...

66
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
A prank sexy photo?

67
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,160
The prize is 200,000 yen!

68
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,500
I see. So this is the highlight!

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,580
If you get angry, I'll stop it.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,040
You don't have to say it.

71
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,120
I'll help you.

72
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't have to say it!

73
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,060
Hey!

74
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,900
What?

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
What a bad guy!

76
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,420
He's such an idiot.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,840
He's a pervert!

78
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,300
He's got a bad temper.

79
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,520
What should I do?

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,800
I can't believe it.

81
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,020
I don't have to.

82
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,860
He's going to take it.

83
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,400
Excuse me!

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,040
Excuse me!

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
Can I drink some water?

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,500
Here it is!

87
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,740
Take it!

88
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,300
Thank you!

89
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,600
She attacked me!

90
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,760
She caught me!

91
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,840
Huh?

92
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,120
I'm not a pervert!

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,600
Wh-what?

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,080
Are you serious?

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,900
Come to think of it,

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,000
If you knew I'd be here,

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,580
I wouldn't have thought of it.

98
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:19,740
Are you mad?

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,780
No, I'm just...

100
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,880
I was just practicing to save the land in the next year's year-end party.

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
What? Is that so?

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,960
Ryotsu 13: Practicing to Save the Land in the Next Year's Year-end Party

103
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,500
If you can't do anything about it, I'll let you play a little.

104
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,140
Really?

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,380
Yes, cheese!

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,780
I'm counting on you.

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:43,860
Let's go.

108
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,620
This is good.

109
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,460
That idiot!

110
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,660
What's with him?

111
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,100
You bastard!

112
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,440
Why do I have to practice to save the land?

113
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,520
It looked like you were having fun, but...

114
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,040
I won't forgive them! I'll avenge them!

115
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,400
But if you don't do anything, it'll turn into a newspaper story again.

116
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,020
I have a good idea.

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,920
What?

118
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,380
I'll let them taste the humiliation I suffered yesterday.

119
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,380
Wait, you idiots!

120
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,440
I'll make you pay for making Ryotsu 13 angry!

121
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,840
What's with that good idea?

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,320
Do you have more than you can eat?

123
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,100
Oh, it's been a while, Mr. Ryo.

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
You're still not motivated.

125
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,820
You're working on a sports newspaper?

126
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
You're just like me.

127
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,880
Can you leave your own newspaper out to the world?

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
I'm fine.

129
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,700
There's no one who reads our newspapers anyway.

130
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,340
I...

131
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,120
You're the editor of the official newspaper,

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,880
the Katsushika Newspaper Club.

133
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,380
And he's stronger than the editor in charge, Ken.

134
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,020
Nice to meet you.

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,640
Oh, you're not only a newspaper of the blue signal,

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,220
I've never seen another.

137
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,340
I just posted it on the corner of the hallway,

138
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,760
and I told him to do it.

139
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
I don't want to bother you.

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,740
I don't want to bother you.

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,760
I don't want to bother you.

142
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,360
Let me go.

143
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,220
I have a suggestion.

144
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,060
What?

145
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,660
Let me take over the position of editor-in-chief.

146
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,320
Let me take over the position of editor-in-chief.

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Don't say that.

148
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,100
Don't say that.

149
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,040
I refuse.

150
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,660
I think I won a lot of money in the first place.

151
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,820
I think I won a lot of money in the first place.

152
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,740
I won a lot of money in the first place.

153
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't know who made me do this.

154
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,580
I have come to this realization.

155
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,700
Actually, thanks to Mr. Ryo.

156
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,240
To tell you the truth,

157
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:50,960
To tell you the truth,

158
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,700
You are confused and fragrant at the same time.

159
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,960
You are confused and fragrant at the same time.

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,660
Do you know that I am still working here?

161
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Do you know that I am still working here?

162
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,500
Go out.

163
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,760
Go out.

164
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,120
Please leave.

165
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,360
Go out.

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,000
Sangarin

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,540
Alright, now I know his trick.

168
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,860
You know the drill.

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
You said you know...

170
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,180
What are you going to do with the editor at the newspaper?

171
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
Hamurabi Houten.

172
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,740
He has eyes on eyes, teeth on teeth and privacy on privacy!

173
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,500
We'll go through Komachi and Naoko's faults, and recreate it in this newspaper!

174
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,700
Bring it on!

175
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,520
Go, Keel!

176
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,240
Huh?

177
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,660
Ahahahaha!

178
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,620
Wh-Why?!

179
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,560
You're at the place where your boss can't see you and you're working so hard!

180
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,300
You always go to the gym, but why are you going out today?

181
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,360
You should be reading sports newspapers in the coffee shop or going to the pachinko bar.

182
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,100
You should be doing some things everyday.

183
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,340
I think you're the only one who does that every day.

184
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,440
This won't be in the article!

185
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,000
Shatter change!

186
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,740
-You did it! -You did it!

187
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:14,960
-You did it! -You did it!

188
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,040
You did it!

189
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,980
Senpai, what are we supposed to do with the pictures?

190
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,500
This is what we need.

191
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,460
"Sai kuwa ryu ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,520
And the editor-in-chief, leave it to Ryo-tsu Kankichi, you know?

193
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,460
"Sai kuwa ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

194
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,880
"Sai kuwa ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

195
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,900
Are you sure you're okay with this?

196
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,960
It's amazing!

197
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
I-I love it!

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,820
"Sai kuwa ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

199
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,720
"Sai kuwa ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

200
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,080
It's you again, Senpai!

201
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,220
-The money's on me! -The money's on me!

202
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,300
I have a new magazine, so please line up!

203
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,380
Line up! Line up!

204
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,620
-This is way too popular. -Line up! Line up!

205
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,940
This is great! This is really great!

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,280
These two are wonderful!

207
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,080
I see. I can only see them as little girls, but they're really naughty.

208
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,100
Hey, you're a little ahead!

209
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
"Sai kuwa ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

210
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,240
"Sai kuwa ryu shiage wo gorou jirou"

211
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,160
You're so good!

212
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,860
Hey, Komachi and Naoko, what's up?

213
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,380
Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

214
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,700
So you were behind all this, huh?

215
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,280
What's with this newspaper?

216
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,020
I'm just reporting facts as they are.

217
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,620
But this photo is not a copy.

218
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm sure it was a fake.

219
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:32,820
Yeah, it was.

220
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,700
And thanks to this newspaper, you guys became popular.

221
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
People should be grateful for that.

222
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,040
You shouldn't complain.

223
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,320
Popular?

224
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,060
"How long will this newspaper last?"

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
"How long will this newspaper last?"

226
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
"How long will this newspaper last?"

227
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,540
"How long will this newspaper last?"

228
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,840
Did you realize how powerful the newspaper is?

229
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:07,820
"How long will this newspaper last?"

230
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,240
They really bought me with that paper, huh?

231
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:13,940
"How long will this newspaper last?"

232
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,020
"How long will this newspaper last?"

233
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,600
It has to be a police record.

234
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,120
"How long will this newspaper last?"

235
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,940
"How long will this newspaper last?"

236
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,540
How can a woman be remembered like this?

237
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,340
"How long will this newspaper last?"

238
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,440
Can you at least read the whole story?

239
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
What are you looking at, Major?

240
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,880
What's this?

241
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Major!

242
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,280
I picked it up.

243
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,820
I happened to pick it up when I was in the hallway.

244
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,320
Anyway, you don't need two locomotives in one police station.

245
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,680
But I have to listen to the other side.

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,540
You're right. You don't need two locomotives in one station.

247
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,940
Ryo.

248
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,100
Senior...

249
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,220
So you recognized it yourself.

250
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,200
Good. Now the "Katsushika Newspaper" is out of service.

251
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,940
No, the "Katsushika Newspaper" will continue to do so.

252
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,620
What are you talking about?

253
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,820
You recognized it because you didn't need it.

254
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,800
It's your newspaper that we don't need!

255
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,160
What did you say?

256
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,180
Major, it's a stupid newspaper that doesn't have a blue light.

257
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,720
It should be out of service right now.

258
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,040
You don't need to copy and paste the "Chosei Weekly" news.

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,540
That's not true.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,920
The "Katsushika Newspaper" is out of service.

261
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,020
You don't need to copy and paste the "Chosei Weekly" news.

262
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,820
That's right!

263
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,140
Even if you say that, what should I do?

264
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,820
Well, let's have a game.

265
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,520
A game?

266
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,440
Let's see who is more suitable for the "Katsushika Newspaper" and "Katsushika Newspaper"

267
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,640
Let's have a game.

268
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,360
Sounds fun.

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,420
What's the game?

270
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,980
Each time the latest news of two newspapers is published,

271
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,780
the "Katsushika Newspaper" will vote on the most popular one.

272
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,960
The one who wins will be the most popular one.

273
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,820
The one who loses will be the most popular one.

274
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,860
The one who loses will be the most popular one.

275
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,980
Of course, the person who loses is the loser.

276
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,460
The important thing about the newspaper is to catch the reader's heart.

277
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
If you don't have confidence, stop reading the newspaper.

278
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,940
If you don't have confidence, stop reading the newspaper.

279
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,000
Who said you didn't have confidence?

280
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,200
I'm just hoping for it.

281
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,200
I'll take that game.

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,380
I'll take that game.

283
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,680
You did it.

284
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
I don't know.

285
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,220
I don't know.

286
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,600
I'll crush your rotten newspaper.

287
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,020
I'll crush your rotten newspaper.

288
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,800
Watch me.

289
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,540
That is my line.

290
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,820
You'd better be prepared.

291
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,780
The loser makes theuru.

292
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
The winner is Thaturu.

293
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,840
With the help of the people helped by Katsushika Newspaper

294
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,560
by the people helped by Katsushika Newspaper

295
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,520
By the people helped by Katsushika Newspaper

296
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,960
by the people helped by Katsushika Newspaper

297
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,020
The Lose

298
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,500
The Lose

299
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,580
The Lose

300
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,180
The Lose

301
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,240
The Lose

302
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,360
Yoramaru Mori

303
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,460
Is it ok for me to lose this game?

304
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,880
It's ok.

305
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,800
You can't beat Aoshin-go

306
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,040
If you destroy the Blue Ring, I won't be able to say anything bad about you.

307
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't think that's personal right now.

308
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,040
What?

309
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,480
No, no, no.

310
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,040
Last time, it was very popular, but until now, the Blue Ring has been more popular and more famous.

311
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,240
Even if it's popular, it's just between the rich and the poor.

312
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,140
In the Katsushika Shogunate, there are more men than the rich and the poor.

313
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,780
If you grasp the feelings of men, you will definitely win.

314
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,580
That might be true, but...

315
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,660
Leave it to me. I'll make a man's newspaper.

316
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,020
A man's newspaper?

317
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
Senpai, what is a man's newspaper?

318
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,860
What is necessary for a man's newspaper. It's the Oiroke of 1 and 2.

319
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,960
I like it!

320
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,160
Today is the women's kendo practice day.

321
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,840
Why do they have to practice kendo?

322
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,560
That's right.

323
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,040
If I don't do it, I'll be a pauper.

324
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's go!

325
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,260
Let's go!

326
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,240
Kichi!

327
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,740
It hurts...

328
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,440
I'm tired...

329
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,700
Everyone! Kichi Ryotsukan is peeping!

330
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,420
Be careful! He's taking terrible pictures!

331
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,320
Sen...Senpai...

332
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,660
No! No! No!

333
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,100
No, it's not a bad photo. I'm just here to do some research.

334
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,360
Here, here.

335
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,460
Liar!

336
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,300
You're just taking pictures of Komachi and the others!

337
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,960
Come on, let's go. We're practicing outside.

338
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,460
Yes!

339
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,000
No, that's it. This is it.

340
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,100
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

341
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,720
Ryo-sama.

342
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,100
Huh?

343
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,820
Maria!

344
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,560
Ryo-sama! Long time no see!

345
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,440
What? You were practicing with Fukie too?

346
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,380
That's right!

347
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,280
Even though I know you're a man, your kendo figure is sexy.

348
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,700
Hey, Maria.

349
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,380
This is useful.

350
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,220
Maria, I'm actually here to do some research on women's kendo, but the others are not cooperative.

351
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,160
How about you cooperate?

352
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,620
Yes, I'm happy for you, Ryo-sama!

353
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,520
Stand over there.

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,140
Like this?

355
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,640
Yes, like this.

356
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,920
Okay, okay.

357
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,060
It's not very interesting.

358
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,740
Please sit down for a moment.

359
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,380
Like this?

360
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,720
Hmm, it's not quite right.

361
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,480
It's easier to break your legs.

362
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,240
Put your left hand on your head.

363
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,480
It's better to turn your head a little.

364
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,880
Okay, perfect!

365
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,860
Awesome!

366
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,000
Now you're really trying to make an appearance, aren't you?

367
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,700
You're not Aikido!

368
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,540
Come on, let's start!

369
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,920
I couldn't stand them!

370
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,860
We're tired, so we're going to go do our best!

371
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,040
What about me?

372
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,940
Can I join you for a while?

373
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,900
50 yen, right?

374
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,660
Yeah, that'll do.

375
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:16,940
I think we got a new idea.

376
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,340
Okay, let's get this over with.

377
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,420
Senpai, what's next?

378
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,280
The second stage of the Sports Beauty is the Basket Beauty.

379
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,600
-Let's go! -Let's go!

380
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
-Let's go! -Let's go!

381
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,760
-Let's go! -Let's go!

382
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,300
Here they come.

383
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Just as I expected.

384
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,380
Guys, the defense against the Ryotsu is on!

385
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,680
Get ready, Maria.

386
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,120
This is the war between the Fukuoka and the Ryotsu Kankichi.

387
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,140
Don't try to stop us like you did the other day.

388
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,320
Okay.

389
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,240
What's wrong, Senpai?

390
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,840
I think they're locked.

391
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,240
Hey, it's a material of my own!

392
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,220
-I'll give it to you! -Hey!

393
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,360
-I'll give it to you! -Hey!

394
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,980
-Hey! -I'll give it to you!

395
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,220
-Hey! -I'll give it to you!

396
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,540
-Hey! -I'll give it to you!

397
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,000
-I'll give it to you! -I'll give it to you!

398
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,920
That's Naoko Komachi's voice.

399
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,420
This is dirty!

400
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,140
It's the office's duty to cooperate with the locomotive.

401
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,140
You don't have to go over here to make a newspaper.

402
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,280
You can go over here.

403
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,540
Veniac!

404
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,720
Not yet!

405
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,060
It's open.

406
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,160
Hey, you!

407
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,260
You!

408
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,160
Hey, you!

409
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,800
Tsk!

410
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,740
Take a photo!

411
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,200
Spin around?

412
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,000
You're an expert.

413
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,740
Spin around?

414
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,520
Tsk!

415
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,460
Tsk!

416
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,740
Yaaah!

417
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,780
Tsk!

418
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,960
Tsk!

419
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,680
Tsk!

420
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,960
Sheesh!

421
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,840
This week, a special episode of Sports Beauty is impossible.

422
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,000
Impossible.

423
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,080
How do you fill in the blank?

424
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,360
How about reviving the corner of the boss and boss' party?

425
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,080
Who reads such a thing?

426
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,960
Okay, let's predict the top news of this week.

427
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,380
Then, let's start my serial manga.

428
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,800
Oh, no!

429
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,160
Oh, no!

430
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,620
Oh, no!

431
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,920
Oh, no!

432
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,140
You're not supposed to do that!

433
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,420
You're copying me!

434
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,920
We're not stealing!

435
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,600
We're getting permission from the boss!

436
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,720
That's not good, Timo!

437
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
Number 3.

438
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,000
"Kaname Sotomawari"

439
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,740
Number 2.

440
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,700
Number 10.

441
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,020
"Harahoro"

442
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,860
You're not getting what you expected.

443
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,680
Hey!

444
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,220
What are you doing?

445
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,360
What are you doing?

446
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,620
Wait!

447
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,560
I'll hit you next time!

448
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:37,620
You're not getting it!

449
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,820
Oh, no!

450
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:42,980
You're to blame!

451
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
Well, it's a backwater now.

452
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,340
It's time to...

453
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,480
Don't you ever read any of this!

454
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,400
What do we do, human?

455
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,080
At this rate, Katsushika Newspaper House will be empty!

456
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,360
What I'm supposed to do...

457
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,360
Don't be mad.

458
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,120
I'll take back my word.

459
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,260
Backward?

460
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,360
With this plan, any magazine or newspaper can be re-run.

461
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,120
And these will help fuel more popularity of the couple.

462
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,040
It's a way to recover your popularity.

463
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
No way...

464
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,780
You're so silly.

465
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,200
Reiko is especially popular among male police officers.

466
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,120
According to Maria, Reiko will be staying at the women's room today.

467
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,980
She will be taking pictures of the scenes in Ryo's bath.

468
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,640
Is she really going to do that, senpai?

469
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,360
It's too much to put the "Nudo" book on the locomotive.

470
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,260
Reiko is a clerk at the Katsushika library.

471
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,900
It is the duty of the locomotive to announce the clerk without hiding the crime.

472
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,120
Is that so?

473
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,900
Huh? That's...

474
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,120
Start the operation!

475
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,380
It's a little hard to take pictures of this.

476
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,360
Don't worry.

477
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,880
This CCD camera can be taken out of anywhere.

478
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,100
The camera will be taken out.

479
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,580
The pictures that are taken out can be seen on this monitor.

480
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,800
You can print them on a high-quality printer.

481
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,620
Ready?

482
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,460
Here.

483
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,520
Here it is.

484
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,480
We're number one, aren't we?

485
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,720
Here we go.

486
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,500
This is...

487
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,160
This is...

488
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,820
Hurry up, Reiko! Hurry up!

489
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm coming!

490
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,380
Okay, I'll take a picture with the WAP.

491
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,160
Damn it!

492
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,400
I got it!

493
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,860
You were out of soap, weren't you?

494
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,360
It wasn't you!

495
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,740
I wasn't you!

496
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,360
Reiko!

497
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,120
No, no, no, Reiko!

498
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,020
Just a little more...

499
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,600
Be quiet!

500
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,660
Senpai...

501
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,400
Let's stop this.

502
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,820
This is definitely not good.

503
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,800
What?

504
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,460
Wait a minute!

505
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,060
Stop it!

506
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,560
Stop it!

507
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,000
Hey, isn't it noisy outside?

508
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,820
By the way...

509
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,200
What's that?

510
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,960
Camera?

511
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:54,920
Ah!

512
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,080
Ryo! Kankichi!

513
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,060
Oh no!

514
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,020
Ryo!

515
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,300
I won't let you!

516
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,340
This is...

517
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,840
That's...

518
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,900
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

519
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,280
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

520
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,920
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

521
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,620
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

522
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,120
Ow!

523
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:21,700
Come on!

524
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,620
Why?

525
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,080
I won't stop!

526
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,040
Hey, come on!

527
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,000
Why are you doing this to me?

528
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,900
Aren't you shorts!

529
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,340
I died here many years ago...

530
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,620
You can't just admit it like that.

531
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,680
You can't just admit it like that.

532
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,900
Don't let me get away with this, you idiot!

533
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,600
Senpai, I was also punished for the crime.

534
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,720
What do I do with my bike loan?

535
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,520
I was chased out of the house by my wife.

536
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,440
What am I going to do?

537
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Even if I tell you that...

538
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
I don't care!

539
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,820
I don't care!

540
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,780
Please, editor-in-chief, do something!

541
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,100
Editor-in-chief, please!

542
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,080
Hey, you!

543
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,760
I finally got the bonus after I found the

544
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,280
Koshi-tora sweat.

545
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,120
I'm told to return the debt, but I can't return it without saying, "Yes, is that so?"

546
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,120
