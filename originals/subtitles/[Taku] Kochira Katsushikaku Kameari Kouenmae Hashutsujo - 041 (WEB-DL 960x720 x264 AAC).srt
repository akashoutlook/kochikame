1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
Rollin'

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,460
Fly into the river

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,860
As I wait for a day to come

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,260
With my love at stake

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,820
I fly to my shoes

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,380
From the water tank of the Tungari-boshi

7
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,900
The sun sets to the Taishakuten

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow it will end like this

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,500
I was happy again with the Katsushika Shiba

10
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,100
I realized it

11
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,040
Because I'm an idiot

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,640
First love, that's Ryotsu

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Oharo, please have some tea.

14
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,020
Oh, sorry.

15
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,920
If you fill too much, it's not good for your body.

16
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,620
No, I have a job I want to do all day today.

17
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,740
Is that so?

18
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,420
Then don't force yourself too much.

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,400
Thank you, Asada-kun.

20
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,120
Please call me Yuuko.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,520
Really?

22
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,540
Then, Yu...

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,840
Yuuko.

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,340
Yuuko...

25
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,500
Hey, Omari-san.

26
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,420
Hey, Omari-san.

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,860
Are you listening?

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Yes?

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,440
Which bus stop should I go to at Bakuro Yokoyama Station?

30
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,420
The bus stop should follow this road.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,020
I see.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,740
I hope we can find it soon.

33
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,500
I see.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,920
Then I'll go to the bus stop.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,180
Thank you.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,680
Thank you, Mr. Katsushika.

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,720
I'll go to the bus stop.

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,160
Thank you.

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,780
Good night.

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't make me laugh.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,060
Good night.

44
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,700
Get out of the way!

45
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,620
No, no, no! The ship is currently on a mission.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,060
But...

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,260
But...

48
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,600
If you want to get it, please line up as soon as possible.

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,720
This is the last day.

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
If you want to buy a photo book with Yuyuko Asada, please line up here.

51
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,180
I'm sure he'll go back to my place.

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,620
Thank you.

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,320
Thank you very much.

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Thank you.

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,700
Thank you.

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,700
Thank you.

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,620
Thank you.

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:34,780
Thank you.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Why? You've been so quiet since before.

60
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,600
Thank you.

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,480
Thank you.

62
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,840
Ah, my...

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,580
Chief!

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,420
Oh, I'm so glad.

65
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,180
One picture...

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,500
No, one more picture than before!

67
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,340
Thank you very much.

68
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm so happy!

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Roger!

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,900
Ryotsu, why are you here?

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,200
You can't fool me.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,780
I saw it with my own eyes.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,740
You're the head during your work hours.

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,400
What are you doing with your hands?

75
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,280
I was just reading the news while patrolling the man-eating hat.

76
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,400
You were patrolling?

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,260
Don't be so harsh.

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,940
Show me instead.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,360
What's this?

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,500
Isn't this HK?

81
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,780
Of course.

82
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,680
Who do you think Yuuko Asada is?

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,780
It's so beautiful.

84
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,160
I love the same woman.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
It's so beautiful.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,040
She's a Japanese actress.

87
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,260
She's a Japanese actress.

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Only the actress with these hats can match her taste.

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,660
Really?

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,340
I put a lot of effort to it.

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,460
I didn't see her like that before.

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Ryotsu!

93
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,980
Be brave!

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,820
It's very good taste.

95
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,220
Not everyone likes her.

96
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,400
You look too close.

97
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,360
Don't get your eyes bent!

98
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,020
Wait a minute.

99
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,740
I met this actress somewhere.

100
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,440
I've met her somewhere.

101
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,220
What? You mean Asada Yuko?

102
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,040
I think everyone who's seen her on TV knows her.

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,820
No, I'm not. I've met her somewhere.

104
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,560
What is that?

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,940
It's a TV station car.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,660
Cheese!

107
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,580
There's a Kanchan from Ryotsu, right?

108
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,380
Yes, there is.

109
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,460
What did you do again?

110
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,220
I don't know.

111
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,880
You're Kanchan?

112
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,420
You're so unique!

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,040
Nice! It's a TV station car!

114
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,980
What is a TV station?

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm actually the director of KTV.

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,320
I came here to ask you to appear on TV.

117
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,420
TV?

118
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,620
Yes, I can't help it.

119
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,560
I'd be happy if I knew that you're a first love.

120
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,500
What do you mean?

121
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,780
Tomo.

122
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
What a charm!

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,720
You seemed to be a first love.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,020
Did you say that?

125
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,420
NO!

126
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,540
Were you mistaken?

127
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,180
That's right! I was wrong.

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,780
I'm not sure if you're real or not.

129
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,680
You always do such things.

130
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
It's possible to say I'm the best KTV usually.

131
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,820
Here's a new story.

132
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,360
Kanchan.

133
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,480
It's me.

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,420
I've been reading the album on TV since I was in elementary school.

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,620
I'm similar to Yuko's mother.

136
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,960
I'm checking with my mom.

137
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,360
You have a good eye for the camera since you were a kid.

138
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,700
This is a picture from the time of the parade.

139
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,020
Ah, by the way, there was a big girl in the back of the elementary school.

140
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,740
That's right.

141
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,140
That girl is Yuko Asada, who is excited about the present.

142
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,160
It was true that I had said that I had met before.

143
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,260
Oh, you're good.

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,720
I see.

145
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,640
I see. You were in love with me at that time.

146
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,740
I was always hiding and watching my first love, my beloved Kan-chan, while I was excited about the sad girl's heart.

147
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,520
Don't you hate me?

148
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,560
No.

149
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,860
I can't believe that a girl like Yuko Asada is like a primitive man.

150
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,560
It's impossible to believe.

151
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,760
But I've never talked to her.

152
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,500
It's because of her love for you.

153
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,060
I've also looked up the story.

154
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,300
She said she was a long-legged, cool sportsman.

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,160
Long legs?

156
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,080
It's hard to say that she was long-legged.

157
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,280
Even though I thought she was long-legged, I was wrong.

158
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,080
Her nickname was very nice.

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
I remember that nickname when I was in elementary school.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,660
I think it was when I was in high school.

161
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,620
It was a perfect nickname.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
Very nice?

163
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,280
Is it a mistake of the data?

164
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,280
There is no mistake in the country's KTV.

165
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right. This is decisive.

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,280
I got a love letter from the trash can on the day of graduation.

167
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,280
What? A love letter from the trash can?

168
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,320
Was there such a happy thing?

169
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,440
I got it, right?

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,820
Yuko-san wouldn't lie.

171
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,920
That's right.

172
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,340
Try to remember, Ryotsu.

173
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,480
Come on, remember.

174
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,020
Remember, come on.

175
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,140
I remember.

176
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,160
I feel like I had it.

177
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,200
I got it, I got it, I got it.

178
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,940
I got it, I got it, I got it.

179
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,860
Look at me.

180
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,740
After all, there is no mistake in my research.

181
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,240
I remember something.

182
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,920
The color of the blanket between the trash can was pink, wasn't it?

183
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Pink?

184
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,320
A big hit?

185
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Is that so?

186
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
That's right.

187
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm the first love of Yuko Asada.

188
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,720
Is that so?

189
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,600
Then, I'll call you later.

190
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,980
Thank you.

191
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,620
Isn't he amazing, Ryo-chan?

192
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,140
Well, Kan-chan, I called him Yurin.

193
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,220
That great actress, Yurin.

194
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,060
I don't know what will happen in the world.

195
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,700
That's where I'm going, Ryotsu.

196
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,980
I have a favor to ask you.

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,860
A favor? What is it?

198
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,180
When I meet Yuko-san,

199
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,820
can you get me a signature for this photo book?

200
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,820
I want to give a love letter to Mr. Ohara.

201
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,680
I'll write a love letter to Mr. Ohara.

202
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,980
But, you're the first love of Yuko Asada.

203
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,440
You can't do something so vulgar.

204
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
But, I'll do something about it.

205
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,400
If you say so, you can think about it.

206
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,080
I see.

207
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,640
If you can imitate what I do here,

208
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,540
I'll do something about it.

209
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,420
I did it in elementary school.

210
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,220
It's a gag that invited all the students to a big party.

211
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
What is that?

212
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,780
It's suspicious.

213
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,100
It's about Ryo-chan.

214
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,320
It's a joke.

215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,440
You're right.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,340
If you don't want to do it, it's fine.

217
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,420
I'm sure Yuri was staring at my gag.

218
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,580
I see.

219
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,680
Then, I'll definitely get a signature.

220
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,420
Of course.

221
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
It's a promise from a man.

222
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,860
Not only a signature,

223
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,300
you can do it with him.

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,700
Then, you can shake hands.

225
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,120
Shake hands?

226
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,140
No.

227
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,160
All right.

228
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,920
I'll do it.

229
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,980
How?

230
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,520
First,

231
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,480
put your fingers in the nostrils.

232
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,380
What's wrong?

233
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,480
Hurry up.

234
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,460
Chief,

235
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,620
you're so motivated.

236
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,180
No.

237
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,960
How is it, Ryo-chan?

238
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,860
If you're really not motivated, it's fine.

239
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,620
What?

240
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,300
What?

241
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Did I do something wrong?

242
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,860
It's over or there is no high çıkarion.

243
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,720
High...

244
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,580
A high...

245
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,480
You'll see Yuko Asada who you yearn for.

246
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,880
As you do that...

247
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,100
I got it...

248
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,600
-H Gina! -A agora!

249
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,300
-Gira! -A agora!

250
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,180
Have you done enough?

251
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Aren't you ashamed?

252
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,320
What?

253
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,460
I mean, it was a joke.

254
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,660
Fine.

255
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,520
Ryo and Kiki,

256
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,680
I'll count on you.

257
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,260
I'll be going.

258
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,640
Ohara-kun!

259
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,700
Yes, yes.

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,960
Good work.

261
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,880
Chief, you're like Ryo-chan's manager.

262
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,060
You're like her lover.

263
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,780
I can't help it.

264
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,660
Thanks to you, I can meet Asada Yuko.

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh, it's the TV station.

266
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,480
Look, Ryo-chan.

267
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,020
The TV station is huge.

268
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,540
Ryo-chan.

269
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
It's okay, it's okay.

270
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,540
Can you call the director, Mizusawa-chan?

271
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,860
What?

272
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,300
Hey, Kan-chan!

273
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,320
Wait for me!

274
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,720
Yo, Mizusawa-chan!

275
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,960
Oh, oh!

276
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,660
The Omutaguni of the swap is going up and down!

277
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,620
Oh!

278
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Chief, Chief, it's Omuro-Namie!

279
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,660
Oh, oh!

280
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,580
What?

281
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,060
What did you say?

282
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,960
What did you say about the Omuretsu with Matsutake?

283
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,660
Oh, I don't know about the director.

284
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
I can't tell you how moved I am.

285
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm Asada Yuko's only son.

286
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,700
It's thanks to this first love that I can meet that Yuuri.

287
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,900
Please understand that.

288
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I understand.

289
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,220
Kan-chan, you're determined today.

290
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,200
Let's go to the usual place as usual.

291
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,100
Let's go to the usual place as usual.

292
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,060
Let's go to the usual place as usual.

293
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,300
Yuuri!

294
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,240
Yuuri!

295
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,840
Yuuri!

296
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,320
Yuuri!

297
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:56,900
Yuuri!

298
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Let's go

299
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,020
Wait!

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,680
It's 3:00 in the morning.

301
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,620
Wait here quietly, Kan-chan.

302
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,580
Can you keep the star waiting?

303
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
I'll wait!

304
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,740
I see a가

305
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,500
Ouch!

306
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,840
I know that the tonkatsu and the nori noodles from the store are delicious.

307
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,480
What's wrong, chief?

308
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm in the bathroom.

309
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,060
Chief, don't be so nervous.

310
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,220
I'm going to puke.

311
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,980
I feel refreshed.

312
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,820
You should take a shower by yourself.

313
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
I feel a little bit sad to be alone.

314
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,680
That's why you are in trouble.

315
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,680
Well, well, well...

316
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,540
Huh? Where did it come from?

317
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,560
Well, whatever.

318
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,380
Hey, Ryozu, it wasn't here, was it?

319
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,720
I'm worried about you, chief.

320
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,160
Leave it to me.

321
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,280
Was it here?

322
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,280
I'll do the makeup.

323
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,960
Excuse me.

324
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,580
Hey, you're leaving.

325
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,500
I'm the one who's leaving.

326
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,900
The device was wrong.

327
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,720
Hang in there, Ryozu.

328
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,160
I left it to you.

329
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,380
It's okay.

330
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,200
You can go to the studio by the time it's time.

331
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,860
If I make a mistake this time, I'll be sorry.

332
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:36,980
Huh?

333
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,360
Do you think you don't have to see Yuyuko Asada by saying that?

334
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,680
It's a lie. It's a lie.

335
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,900
Ryozu, don't say that.

336
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:44,980
Please.

337
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,260
I hope you understand.

338
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,520
Then, please come with me quietly.

339
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,400
Ryozu...

340
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,180
What's wrong, Ohara?

341
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,380
No, nothing.

342
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,840
Is it really okay here?

343
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,460
Yeah.

344
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,740
Huh? Chief, we're on the screen.

345
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,780
Huh?

346
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,400
Huh?

347
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,520
Is it this camera?

348
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
What?

349
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,760
Who's on TV?

350
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,300
Is it me?

351
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:20,420
Is it this?

352
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,460
Hey, get out of my way.

353
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,140
Chief, Chief, look.

354
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,120
I'm on the screen.

355
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,060
It's someone else.

356
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,000
You're...

357
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,640
What are you doing?

358
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm...

359
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,140
Who do you think I am?

360
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,440
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Asada.

361
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,500
Why do I have to run away?

362
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,060
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Asada.

363
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Asada.

364
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,580
No, no, no.

365
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Masada.

366
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,220
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Masada.

367
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,780
Watch out, I tell you.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,760
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Masada.

369
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,060
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
You're the first love of Yuyuko Asada.

371
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,000
When did he take your body to see me?

372
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,340
What the hell are you doing in my house?

373
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,540
I'm the first love of Yuyuko Asada.

374
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,840
The one in charge of such a thing.

375
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,820
I'm a ex-boyfriend.

376
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
It's not good, is it?

377
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,200
This is delicious. You should eat it.

378
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,780
But...

379
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm the pekingian of cooking, introducing a Chinese dish.

380
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,920
Today's dish is this.

381
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,100
Idiot!

382
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,340
You haven't eaten all of it yet!

383
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,200
Ryo, we're running out of time.

384
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,460
I know, I know.

385
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,460
This is great!

386
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
Russian human pie.

387
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm Iwana Petya.

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,620
Ryo, is this good?

389
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,760
It's good.

390
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,180
Why?

391
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,000
Looking at the set from the back, it looks like a simple one made in a convenience store.

392
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,640
Oh, I see.

393
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,660
Why am I the only one who looks like this?

394
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,880
Ryo, where are you?

395
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,200
Oh, I'm here.

396
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,760
What are you doing? The show's about to start.

397
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,840
Oh, yes.

398
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,000
It's about to start.

399
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,020
Ryo, are you okay?

400
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,600
I wonder if the director will be able to see me.

401
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,380
I'm nervous.

402
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,360
Ah, my heart is beating so fast.

403
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,260
Hi, everyone.

404
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,320
It's time for 3:00 PM.

405
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,980
Our guest today is the famous Japanese actress, Yuko Asada.

406
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,600
Hello, I'm Yuko Asada.

407
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,540
You're beautiful, Yuko Asada.

408
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,660
When I look up close...

409
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,400
...you're so dazzling.

410
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,680
You're so beautiful.

411
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,200
When you meet her, give her this bouquet.

412
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,620
Okay?

413
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,200
Thank you.

414
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,320
And when you're a child, you can ask Yurin about how much I was attractive.

415
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,780
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

416
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,000
Now, it's time for the "Memories" segment.

417
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,220
Finally.

418
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,340
Let's go, Asada.

419
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,540
Oh, no. I'm nervous.

420
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,020
First, the silhouette quiz.

421
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,860
Who is this person?

422
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
Excuse me. I don't know much about this.

423
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,380
Well, it's not impossible.

424
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,240
It's just that it's different from elementary school.

425
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,680
Well, I'll call you by the nickname of Asada at the time, so listen carefully.

426
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,080
Here you go.

427
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,000
Yurin.

428
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,380
I don't know much about it.

429
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,240
If I knew it, Yurin would be very impressed.

430
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,800
Ah, you're...

431
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,840
Kan-chan!

432
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,720
Yuriiiiin!

433
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,920
Yuriiin. What's wrong?

434
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,380
What if she asks me to marry her?

435
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,460
I'll give you a big hint.

436
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,460
The first name of the name is "Ri".

437
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,040
Ri...Ri, right?

438
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,380
You're even more beautiful when you're worried.

439
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,300
Okay, then. Here's a big hint.

440
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,160
My name is Kankichi.

441
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,420
Kankichi-san.

442
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,740
You still don't remember?

443
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,980
I won't call you by full name.

444
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,820
Hey, hey. What's going on, Mizusawa-chan?

445
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,340
Please.

446
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,180
It's okay. It's okay.

447
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,860
The actress seems to be in trouble.

448
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,560
Well, let's say it.

449
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,600
The full name is...

450
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,760
Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san!

451
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,620
Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san!

452
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,060
Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san!

453
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,160
Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san!

454
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,720
Yes, Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san!

455
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,140
Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san!

456
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,960
Who are you?

457
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,900
Who are you?

458
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,620
I'm...

459
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,760
I have a bad feeling about this.

460
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,980
Hmm...

461
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,300
Even if the actress doesn't forget her line,

462
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,700
will she forget her name?

463
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,560
After all, it's something she did since elementary school.

464
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,120
So, I'll give you a special hint.

465
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,540
Please come out to the stage.

466
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,400
Even if she forgets her name,

467
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,340
she should remember my face.

468
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
Ryo-tsu Kankichi-san, please.

469
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,220
Yuuri!

470
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,720
Who is this person?

471
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,480
What's going on?

472
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,340
His nickname is "Funkorogashi".

473
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,900
Now, you remember, right?

474
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,100
I see.

475
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,100
I see.

476
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,560
Oh, I see.

477
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,940
Come on, come on, come on.

478
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,640
Hey, let me take a photo of you.

479
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,500
It's a love letter.

480
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,700
Ah, it's been 20 years to do so.

481
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,300
I can't remember anything.

482
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,280
Oh.

483
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,060
Ah, I forgot something important.

484
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
Asada-san has once put a love letter in a trash cans.

485
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,900
A love letter?

486
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,220
In a trash cans?

487
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,280
Oh, yes.

488
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,820
This person is the one.

489
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,240
I think you can remember something from the photo.

490
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,860
It's her.

491
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,000
This is the one.

492
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm Ryochi, a leader of the school.

493
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,100
Oh!

494
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,860
I think you'll remember this gag if you watch it.

495
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,520
Gag?

496
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes!

497
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,280
I was popular in school at that time.

498
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,840
I made the whole school laugh at me.

499
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,200
It's a gag!

500
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,420
Then please watch it!

501
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:51,840
Okay!

502
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,700
Oh, my God!

503
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,420
I remember!

504
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,900
Yay!

505
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,420
It's a touching encounter!

506
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,060
Oh, my God!

507
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,420
I'm Ryochi, the leader of the school, who made a joke about my uniform.

508
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,060
Ryochi Kankichi!

509
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,320
What a fool!

510
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,480
But, your mother said that this photo is her.

511
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,280
I gave you my love letter.

512
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,260
You idiot!

513
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,260
I'm not your enemy!

514
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,540
I'm sorry!

515
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,720
I can't live any more!

516
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,240
This man is the least good person in this school, Kankichi Ryochi.

517
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,840
Kankichi Ryochi!

518
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,020
Kankichi Ryochi!

519
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,920
Is this the national internet?

520
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,480
Idiot!

521
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,100
Come on!

522
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,980
Eat up!

523
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,940
Ryotsu, don't lose your temper.

524
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,440
Do it harder!

525
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,120
I'm trying!

526
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,480
Just stop it already!

527
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
No!

528
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm paying you back for messing up my show!

529
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,720
Now, you guys!

530
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,880
Let's get rid of all the grudges!

531
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,460
Yes!

532
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm so scared!

533
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,120
Don't you dare, Ryotsu!

534
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,260
Yo!

535
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,640
How was the show?

536
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,460
What?

537
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,160
You!

538
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,040
Actually,

539
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,620
the one we did last time

540
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,040
had the best ratings.

541
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,140
That's the fun of live broadcasting.

542
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,800
So,

543
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,040
I'd like to have you on every show

544
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,180
and make a segment about you.

545
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,060
Sure!

546
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,800
Don't mess with me!

547
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm never going to be on TV!

548
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,280
No matter what they say,

549
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,980
I'll show you my wani-kou!

550
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,600
This guy's character is easy to misunderstand.

551
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,980
He's no stranger to me!

552
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,240
Besides,

553
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,860
I had a dream of buying a wani when I was a kid!

554
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,180
Next time,

555
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,320
"Wani-kou! The Soul of the Artist of Tears!"

556
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,160
Don't miss it!

557
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,980
Don't miss it!

558
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,720
She's a girl who can't fall in love

559
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,160
Rumor has it

560
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,020
There are many things she wants to do

561
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,440
I'd like to run in a bike

562
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,460
across the vast desert

563
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,920
I want to ride a vacuum motorcycle

564
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,220
I want to be more free than a bird

565
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:07,520
A lady's dream that changes at the speed of a telescope

566
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm sorry for my love, I'm sorry

567
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,300
The future of the panorama

568
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,700
The dazzling light that dives

569
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,540
You understand, right?

570
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,020
I'm sorry, wait for me
