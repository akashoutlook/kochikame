00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,260
I looked at the sunset floating in the river

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:24,580
I kicked a stone and it flew to my shoes

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:32,760
I wonder if I should go to the gym I was saving money for

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,880
I was laughed at for being a kid

6
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,600
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,960
There are only patsushika and kameari

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,720
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yawn is strangely kind

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,380
From the waterfront of the Tungari-boshi

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:07,120
To the taishakuten, the sunset falls

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,460
Tomorrow will end like this

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,900
I lost my happiness again because of the patsushika and kameari

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,800
I realized

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,220
I'm an idiot

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,940
'Cause I'm an idiot

16
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,160
A本抹け in Canada

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,840
To the Tungari-boshi

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,340
To the Tungari-boshi

19
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,160
To the Tungari-boshi

20
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,780
To the Tungari-boshi

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,140
To the Tungari-boshi

22
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:53,220
To the Tungari-boshi

23
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,560
To the Tungari-boshi

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,460
You're so annoying!

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,340
Reiko is on a trip, and the chief isn't paying me.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,780
Why do I have to work in this damn hot place alone?!

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,800
Oh, right! I think the ice pillow fell off...

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,040
Huh? What's this?

29
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,320
Hey! This is the magic circle I found in Haru!

30
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,100
I totally forgot to hide it so the chief wouldn't find it!

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,940
Yay! I'm so lucky!

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,940
I'm so lucky!

33
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,100
This is the blessing of God!

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,900
Huh? Wait a minute.

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,920
I think the best time to get a cold is on the 60th.

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,900
49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60?!

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,620
What?! If I don't change it today, it'll be a year!

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,720
I think the ice pillow was about 1000 yen.

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,060
I can't afford to lose it.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
What should I use it for?

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm so lucky!

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,100
It's my death!

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm so glad.

44
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm finally awake!

45
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,620
Maria, where are you?

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,260
I should've slept a little longer.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,940
What?!

48
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,960
It's the old man from Hondara!

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,840
What happened?

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,380
I'll take you to Canada.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,580
What?

52
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,480
Actually, I'm going to make a division in Canada.

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,500
I'm going to travel with Ai.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,300
Besides, why do I have to go with you?

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,480
I could go with you, Ryo.

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,600
It's okay if you're with the king.

57
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,060
Ai won't say it like that.

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,720
I brought you here.

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,500
Ah!

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,920
You've got to be kidding!

61
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,660
Is this your job to kill me with an anvil?

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
Huh?!

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,640
Ah!

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,180
Hey!

65
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,000
I have to change this sword by the end of today!

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,180
No way!

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,600
I can't make it with 100,000 yen!

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,540
Excuse me!

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,880
Let go!

70
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,620
I have to change the sword!

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,480
No!

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,400
Wait!

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,380
Sir!

74
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,440
Uwa!

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,780
That's why I said no!

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
Hey! You brought me here while I was in despair!

77
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,360
Why did you give me 100,000 yen?

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,220
Don't be so excited.

79
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,580
If you go to Canada, you'll only get nice things.

80
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,440
Nice things?

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,920
The village where I bought land for my wife has a big dog in it.

82
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,760
What?

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,620
It's not a dog with a love pad. It's a live dog.

84
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,900
And it has F-cup and G-cup.

85
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,400
What? A live dog?

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,480
I've been to Canada before.

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,840
What? I've been to Canada before.

88
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,560
What? I've been to Canada before.

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,600
I've been to Canada before.

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,360
What? I've been to Canada before.

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,240
What? I've been to Canada before.

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,600
It seems he downwards.

93
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,860
That's why I'm so excited to have a life like my wife!

94
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,820
What? I've been to Canada before.

95
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,600
I've been to Canada before.

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
What? I've been to Canada before.

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,940
What? I've been to Canada before.

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,440
But I can't imagine living in Canada.

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,980
If I was given the chance, would I have been able to do it?!

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,140
You should be in a amidst of many people.

101
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,780
I'll wake up and give you a ride.

102
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,020
But there's nothing I would do if I ever have to.

103
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm sorry to hear that.

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,180
I'm sorry to hear that.

105
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm sorry to hear that.

106
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm sorry to hear that.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm sorry to hear that.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,620
I'm sorry to hear that.

110
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm sorry to hear that.

111
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm sorry to hear that.

112
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm sorry to hear that.

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm sorry to hear that.

114
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm sorry to hear that.

115
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm sorry to hear that.

116
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm sorry to hear that.

117
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm sorry to hear that.

118
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:56,980
I'm sorry to hear that.

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm sorry to hear that.

120
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,340
I'm sorry to hear that.

121
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm sorry to hear that.

122
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm sorry to hear that.

123
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm sorry to hear that.

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

125
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,420
I'm sorry to hear that.

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm sorry to hear that.

127
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,440
I'm sorry to hear that.

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm sorry to hear that.

129
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm sorry to hear that.

130
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm sorry to hear that.

131
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm sorry to hear that.

132
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,000
I love you, I'm sorry to hear that.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
I love you, I'm sorry to hear that.

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm sorry to hear that.

135
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,140
I love you, I'm sorry to hear that.

136
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,480
My dream is to make the Honda-ra Kemp the best fighting game in the world!

137
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,600
Ah, we're here.

138
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,280
It looks like we're going to change planes from here.

139
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Hey! Is there really a Nama-chichi here?!

140
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,960
Nama-chichi?

141
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,300
Ryo-sama, what's a Nama-chichi?!

142
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,100
Well, it's a Nama-chi, no, an egg-chi.

143
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,340
It's a Nama-chau-na.

144
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,880
I was invited to a date.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,580
What is it? What is it?

146
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,520
Hey, where are you from?

147
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,960
Aren't you from Alaska?

148
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,600
Is this place okay?

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
Well, there are a thousand of them.

150
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,460
Well, it's okay.

151
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,620
Wow!

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
I can't believe you can build a building on ice like that.

153
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't you think you got tricked?!

154
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,160
Who on earth bought it?!

155
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,100
Well, I think it was Hanyu who said it, right?

156
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,940
What?!

157
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,580
Ah!

158
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,240
This is a fake real estate company with a chip on it!

159
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,860
Ehh?!

160
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
We were perfectly beaten, huh?

161
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,160
I bought it because it was worth 5 million yen.

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,100
Did I get fooled?

163
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh no! It's a disaster!

164
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,740
What did you do?

165
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,720
Where are the F-cup and G-cup girls?

166
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,760
That's...

167
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,940
You bastard!

168
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,240
Stop it!

169
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,220
You bastard!

170
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,180
Stop it!

171
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,620
What did you say?

172
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,460
You bastard!

173
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,720
You're going to sink into the sea of ice!

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,220
Stop it!

175
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,580
My last...

176
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,740
There's a passport in there!

177
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,860
What's a passport?

178
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,620
What's a passport?

179
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,320
You can't go back to Japan!

180
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,060
I lost 100,000 yen and I'm in this place because of you!

181
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,880
What are you doing, Dad?

182
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,560
Hey, that's my passport!

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm using this passport!

184
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,460
No way!

185
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,660
It's a different picture, so I'm not going to use it!

186
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,380
What are you doing?

187
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,040
What?

188
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,660
Dad!

189
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,700
Look, it's me!

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,020
It's completely different!

191
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,140
No way, Dad!

192
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,520
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,600
Show me your passport!

194
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,960
Look, it's completely different from the picture.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
The judge was in a panic.

196
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,280
It's basically you, Maria!

197
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,660
Anyway, give me your passport!

198
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,760
You can live here by yourself!

199
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,800
No!

200
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,220
No!

201
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,420
Give it to me!

202
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,120
No!

203
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,340
Give it to me!

204
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,720
No!

205
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,580
Give it to me!

206
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,540
Don't bring your face closer!

207
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,580
It's hot!

208
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm begging you!

209
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,380
No!

210
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,360
Don't say that!

211
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,980
I won't!

212
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,320
Please!

213
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,780
It's too much!

214
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,500
Give it to me!

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,680
Give it to me!

216
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:54,960
Give it to me!

217
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,180
Give me back my passport!

218
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,620
Give me my passport!

219
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:58,860
Oh, my!

220
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,880
Good girl.

221
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,500
I'm begging you!

222
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,520
Bring this one over here!

223
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,540
Come here!

224
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,080
Come here!

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Now we are friends!

226
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,820
You!

227
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,940
You dropped it on purpose, huh?

228
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,260
I didn't do that.

229
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,260
You only have 30 yen.

230
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,220
What do you want?

231
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,700
I don't have any.

232
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,020
You're so naughty.

233
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,580
You're a good boy.

234
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,420
You too.

235
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,240
What's wrong with you?

236
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,640
You're a good boy.

237
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,100
What are you doing?

238
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,940
You're a good boy.

239
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,960
What do you want?

240
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,420
What are you doing?

241
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,800
What are you doing?

242
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,380
We're not fighting.

243
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,520
We're just going to die.

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,120
We're not fighting.

245
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,460
We're not going to die.

246
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,340
We're not going to die.

247
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,460
What's that sound?

248
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
It's a helicopter.

249
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,200
The sky didn't let me go.

250
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,380
Help me.

251
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,340
Help me.

252
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,360
Help me.

253
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,500
What did you do?

254
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,620
I thought I heard Ryo's voice.

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,100
I thought I heard Ryo's voice.

256
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,100
I can't believe I'm in the north of Canada.

257
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,700
I can't believe I'm in the north of Canada.

258
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,140
Help me.

259
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,020
Help me.

260
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,940
I didn't notice.

261
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
What are you going to do?

262
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm going to make you notice.

263
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,700
What are you doing?

264
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,220
What are you doing?

265
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Ryo.

266
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,800
Reiko.

267
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
I need a medical check.

268
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,720
I need a medical check.

269
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,320
I need a medical check.

270
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,420
I need a medical check.

271
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,460
.

272
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,140
A isso - I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-iiii....

273
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,440
I need a medical check.

274
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,540
I need a medical check.

275
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:46,680
I need a medical check.

276
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:46,720
I need a medic.

277
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,900
I need a medic.

278
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Help me, will you?

279
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,640
I'll if you save this place.

280
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,620
Thank you, for helping me.

281
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,140
I didn't think Ryo would be here.

282
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,620
I was fooled.

283
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,880
I thought a real man would make a company.

284
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,680
What are you talking about?

285
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,100
You were caught by a live father and you came back.

286
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,280
Live father?

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,740
No, I mean, live father, not live father.

288
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,640
I was just kidding.

289
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,420
By the way, what are you doing here?

290
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,860
My father went to Bahama to play.

291
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,240
So I'm using my courage to do business meetings and inspections with the companies in my line.

292
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,620
Oh, you came here to play.

293
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm going to enjoy my vacation tomorrow since I've finished my work today.

294
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,840
Oh, right.

295
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,480
Why don't we go skiing together tomorrow?

296
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,640
Sounds good.

297
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm not in the mood for that.

298
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,760
Father...

299
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,560
Uncle, I'm going to let my company find the land of Shibu.

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,960
So don't be depressed.

301
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,520
We'll be stuck here for days until we get our passports.

302
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,400
Let's think this is a vacation and play, father.

303
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay, I got it.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,240
I'll leave the rest to you.

305
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,060
When it's decided, let's go play.

306
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,680
You only brought the major items.

307
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,340
Hon Dara has a lot of fun.

308
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,100
Okay, let's play.

309
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,980
Father, you're quick to recover.

310
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,280
It's my first time to be born to like something.

311
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,780
I'm looking forward to it.

312
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,680
Okay.

313
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,580
It's not too late to be excited.

314
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,060
I'll make you pay for your grudges.

315
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,380
Uncle, relax and lower your waist a little.

316
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,480
Is this the way, Reiko-dono?

317
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,380
Yes, keep it up.

318
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,260
You liked the ski in the summer and that's why...

319
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,520
...you came to Canada to learn about beauty.

320
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:49,740
I'm glad you're here.

321
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,580
Hey!

322
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,080
Big jump!

323
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,920
Front first spin twist!

324
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,280
Ryo-sama, you're amazing!

325
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,840
Why are you so good?

326
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,540
I was only a rich man when I was born in Tokyo.

327
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,900
We, the common people, have trained in the snow in Tokyo.

328
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,020
We wore skis made of bamboo and trained with our bare hands.

329
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,880
That's why we're self-proclaimed as the dog-slaughtering law.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,280
But we can't be defeated by those who are skilled.

331
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,160
I'll teach you how to ski.

332
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,980
Don't try to avoid me!

333
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,080
I'm from Reiko!

334
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,740
How dare you say that I'm going to teach you how to ski?

335
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,300
What?

336
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,560
You're challenging me, a budokan!

337
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,740
Wait a minute.

338
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,980
I'm going to remove the skis.

339
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,320
Let's try the hondara sword!

340
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,160
What a good skier.

341
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,640
You can call me a self-proclaimed law.

342
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,100
You're a self-proclaimed law, too.

343
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,520
Then I'll teach you how to ski.

344
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,360
We'll learn to ski faster when we're together.

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,980
Don't say that to Reiko!

346
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,640
All right!

347
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,180
Hehehe.

348
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,760
First, you must ski 1,000 meters at a time,

349
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,520
No way!

350
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,760
What do you mean, no way?

351
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,000
You're going to be a teacher!

352
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,760
You're going to be a teacher!

353
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,320
You're going to be a teacher!

354
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,580
You're going to be a teacher!

355
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:38,900
I don't have any feelings for you!

356
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,260
That's enough!

357
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,880
Get off me!

358
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,080
Where are you going?

359
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Just do it now!

360
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,900
Are you going to be all right, Dad?

361
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,660
No need to worry.

362
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,080
It appears Ryo-chan.

363
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,060
Can't worry about being a teacher.

364
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,500
Can't you get on the lift?

365
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,560
I'm not good at an expensive place.

366
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,340
This is your chance to clear your revenge!

367
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,180
Get off the lift!

368
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,320
Go fix it!

369
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,040
I got it!

370
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,560
Let go!

371
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,500
Let go, idiot!

372
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,560
Then so that's why the game is so long, can't I!?

373
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,740
Hey!

374
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,360
You bastard!

375
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,140
Don't move!

376
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,960
Shut up! I'm going to sit there!

377
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,600
Don't come up!

378
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,300
I said we can't sit here!

379
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,700
Then get off!

380
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
You bastard!

381
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,520
It's so hot! I'm scared!

382
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,860
You bastard! Hold my hand!

383
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,700
Are we going to slide from here?

384
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,100
That's right.

385
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,620
We're almost at the right angle.

386
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,380
That's why we're going to practice the right angle.

387
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,060
I don't even know how to turn or stop!

388
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,740
I'll teach you while we slide.

389
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,060
No!

390
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,340
I'll give you a good lesson this time.

391
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,340
Go now!

392
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,680
Good job!

393
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,100
Next is the right angle.

394
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
And then...

395
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:09,940
Like this!

396
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,460
See?

397
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,200
That's right!

398
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,420
You're a real man!

399
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,860
What's wrong?

400
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,860
I'm cold from the snow.

401
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,180
You're a pathetic dancer.

402
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,220
Go and get it done with the tree.

403
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,400
I got it.

404
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
I didn't think I'd be imitating you in the countryside.

405
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,820
Oh, I'm getting cold too.

406
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,360
Stop it!

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,720
Don't come this way!

408
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,580
Don't grab it!

409
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,360
Stop it!

410
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,380
I can't stop you anymore!

411
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,600
You're all idiots!

412
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,760
Let go of my hand!

413
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,920
Don't come near me!

414
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,320
What are you doing?

415
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,020
*Screams*

416
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,960
*Screams*

417
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,540
*Screams*

418
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,140
*Screams*

419
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,380
*Screams*

420
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,200
*Screams*

421
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,620
Now, the Japanese consulate is contacting us, and the passport will be available by tomorrow.

422
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,360
That was faster than I expected.

423
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,900
What should we do? We can go back to Japan by tomorrow, but should we get a ticket for the plane?

424
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,560
I think it's a little more painful, but it seems like they came out quietly. The chief is very...

425
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,720
Huh? The hunter is so inconspicuous.

426
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,460
There is a local hunting party. There are many bears around here.

427
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,820
I see.

428
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,600
That's quite a lot, Reiko-dono. Thank you for deciding the branch of Hondara Prefecture.

429
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,300
No, no, it's not that big of a deal.

430
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,980
It's decided?

431
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,780
We will put a dojo in the training room of this hotel.

432
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,060
That's good. Now we can go back to Japan with peace of mind.

433
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,560
I and you will stay.

434
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,400
What?

435
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
You two will be the chiefs.

436
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,820
What?

437
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,520
Ai, you can live here as you wish.

438
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,260
But, father, I don't want to be the chief.

439
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,920
We can live together, so it's fine.

440
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,700
That's true, but...

441
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,340
Don't joke around. I didn't hear that. Why am I the chief?

442
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,760
*Screams*

443
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,340
Is it a yes or a no?

444
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,940
Noooo!

445
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,560
Beautiful!

446
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,820
Nooo!

447
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,760
Which one?

448
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,920
Nooooo!

449
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,160
Which one?

450
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,140
Nooo!

451
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,620
Which one?

452
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,360
Nooooooooo!

453
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,500
Beautiful!

454
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,940
I said yes!

455
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,960
It's done.

456
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,360
Reiko-dono, would you like torell tea in the training room?

457
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,300
Yes.

458
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,160
Are you alright, Ryô-sama?

459
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,780
I was weak when I skied.

460
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,960
Maria, tell me how weak father is.

461
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,040
Huh?

462
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,760
If you keep this up, you'll become the head of the law department and live in Canada!

463
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,840
B-But...

464
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,900
Maria, you were tricked too!

465
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,280
Tell me, Maria!

466
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,320
Yes, if you say so...

467
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,900
I remember when I was training in Yamagomori, my dad once bit my head from behind.

468
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,180
And he said I was really bad at it.

469
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,360
That's it!

470
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,560
If you bite me again, I won't tell you to make fat in your body ever again!

471
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,960
I can use this one.

472
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,740
You have to sew it up properly. It's not good to take it off halfway through.

473
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,300
Yes.

474
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,540
But it's real, it's real.

475
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,980
Hide here.

476
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,360
I'll be right back.

477
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,800
Okay.

478
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
I'll bite you as hard as I can.

479
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,320
Here it comes.

480
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,640
Oh my god!

481
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,420
Watch out!

482
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,380
Get out!

483
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,320
What the?!

484
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,220
The hunters are here! Stop it!

485
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,860
The beard hounds are around us too often.

486
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
And they scare me.

487
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,540
Leave me alone.

488
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,760
I've lost my sleep for days.

489
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,900
All right!

490
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,920
Whoa!

491
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,500
You can't grab it just by staring at it.

492
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,600
Wait! Listen to me!

493
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,760
Yeah!

494
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,400
No!

495
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,120
My head!

496
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,360
I can't jump in the air!

497
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
That bear is Ryo-chan?

498
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,240
Yeah.

499
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,860
So you were trying to trick me?

500
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,340
I got it. I'll get you out of here right away.

501
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm getting back on you!

502
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,140
I'm getting back on you!

503
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm getting back on you!

504
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,560
Don't shoot! I'm a human!

505
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,260
Don't shoot! I'm a Japanese policeman!

506
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,900
I have to run to the mountains!

507
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,140
footage 2

508
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:41,000
5 Minutes Later

509
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,300
I've captured all the bears, but I don't know who Ryo-chan is.

510
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,980
It's me, for real.

511
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,200
Oh, no! I was screaming, so my voice got hoarse.

512
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,320
All of them are normal bears.

513
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,200
I understand that too.

514
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,840
I'm sorry...

515
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,460
You're such a bad father! Remember that!

516
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,680
Example!

517
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,920
"Ryotsu Kankichi Junsacho has an order from the president..."

518
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,260
"to go to a restaurant next to the office and do a special job..."

519
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,540
Why do I have to work part-time jobs that I can't even make money from?

520
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,040
If I had to do that, I'd better write a letter of apology at the end of the day!

521
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,680
Next time, "Limi's Revenge Recipe"!

522
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,320
See you then!

524
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,960
There are rumors that I'm a woman who can't fall in love

525
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,880
But I have so much I want to do

526
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,300
I want to ride a bike through the vast desert

527
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,760
More than a bird

528
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
I want to be free

529
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,200
The speed of the full moon

530
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,960
Changes the lady's dream

531
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,980
My love, I'm sorry

532
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm sorry

533
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,260
The future of the panorama

534
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,260
The dazzling light that shines on us

535
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,860
Do you understand?

536
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,900
I'm sorry

537
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,020
Please wait for me
