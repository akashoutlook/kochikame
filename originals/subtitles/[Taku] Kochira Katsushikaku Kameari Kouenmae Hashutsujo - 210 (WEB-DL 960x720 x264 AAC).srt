1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,600
When you watch TV, lit up your room and try to get away from them.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,780
When I don't have any money, come to my place.

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,820
I don't have any, but I worry

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm worried about you

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,980
Look at the blue sky

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,080
And the white clouds

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,980
I'm sure they'll be fine

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,540
I'm sure they'll be fine

9
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,200
Come to me if you don't have a job

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,420
Come to me if you don't have a job

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one either but don't worry

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,360
Look, it's burning

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,000
The red cloud

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,760
The red cloud

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm sure it'll be fine

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,480
I know, I know, I know

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,760
If you do, just shut up and follow me

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
I'll teach you the ninja's way

19
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,740
This show has been popular lately

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,220
What they do is like ninja training

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Then if you get the real one, you win

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,940
What's wrong, senpai?

23
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,000
I heard it's the real ninja

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,340
So I remembered someone

25
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,080
If it's a ninja, it's here

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,500
The dog spoke

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,280
Do you understand human language?

28
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,280
It's me, it's me

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,100
Even if it's me

30
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,880
It's the old man of Bulbo

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,380
Oh, Bulbo's old man is the real ninja

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,800
He's using ninja skills

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,300
Teenagerplank

34
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,820
This is ninja's way of speaking

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
He's hiding somewhere and talking

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,480
Where is he?

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,780
Huh?!

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,200
I can't believe I'm ruined

40
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,640
I'm afraid I'll make them destroy me

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,720
What are you saying?

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,020
So, why did you come out of Kyushu?

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,900
Actually, I wanted to open a ninja school in Tokyo.

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,380
You said that before.

45
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,680
You didn't want to open it in Kyushu?

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Because it seems like it would be more profitable in Tokyo.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,840
That's a pretty easy to understand idea.

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you know about it, Borubo-san?

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,360
I was on my way to his house and got lost on the way.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,560
I came here to follow the map.

51
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,240
When did you find the map?

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,100
I think it's from the annual...

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,540
That's Borubo's room.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,080
He's staying at home today.

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,920
He's staying at home today.

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,080
He's staying at home today.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,480
Let's contact him.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,760
No, that's not possible.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,540
But...

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,180
It's dangerous to enter Borubo's house without permission.

61
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,360
The gang of thugs who tried to get into Borubo's room the other day...

62
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,240
They got caught in Borubo's trap.

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,280
They got caught in the trap that they set up.

64
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,380
They got caught in the trap that they set up.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,400
They got caught in the trap that they set up.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
I can see that they're not good.

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,220
So, I'll show you how to do it.

68
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,220
Hey, hey!

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,560
First, the smoke bomb!

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,340
He's in a panic state.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,760
That's enough.

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Isn't that too much?

73
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,840
That's fine.

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm in a panic.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm in a panic.

76
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,280
These guys are even worse at the game than I thought!

77
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,700
These guys are even worse at the game than I thought!

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,240
Let's start with the fire can.

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,720
I need a good strategy.

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,100
The old man from Kyushu is...

81
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,540
No!

82
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,560
The Volvo is completely in combat mode!

83
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,080
Can't we stop him somehow?

84
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,600
I don't know.

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,800
It's my turn!

86
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,780
Hey, what the hell did you do?

87
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,980
It's a Nude Trump's Nympho.

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,900
What's a Nympho?

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:50,940
What?

90
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,220
Are you opening a ninja school in Tokyo?

91
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,180
Yeah.

92
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,260
I was thinking of renting your room.

93
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,120
What's with this mess?

94
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,260
I might as well clean it up.

95
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Grandpa did it earlier.

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,480
But it's impossible to open a ninja school in this room.

97
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,820
It can't be helped.

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,840
I'll buy land and build a classroom.

99
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,480
Do that from the beginning!

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,000
How much is your budget?

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,780
Don't get me wrong.

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,480
What?

103
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,700
It's 3 million yen.

104
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,620
What?

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,560
You're so surprised.

106
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,700
Nakagawa, tell me the truth.

107
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,680
No matter how much the land price has dropped...

108
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,860
What?

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
I can't believe the land price is so high.

110
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,400
Grandpa, don't be discouraged.

111
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,820
What are you doing?

112
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,280
What are you doing?

113
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,240
You shouldn't be careless.

114
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,100
Yes, sir.

115
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,060
But...

116
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,560
I can't believe the land price is so high.

117
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm in trouble.

118
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,580
I'm so depressed.

119
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,480
Why don't you comfort me a little?

120
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,940
I'll throw you a shuriken or something.

121
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,560
I'll look for a classroom.

122
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,300
Really?

123
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,600
It might be a bed.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,660
I may have to prepare myself.

125
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,160
Thank you very much!

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,880
It was good, grandpa.

127
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,420
Huh.

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,980
How could youλλ

129
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,000
Where?

130
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:35,260
I bought a building before it was demolished at a low price.

131
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,980
You're good at training Ninjya.

132
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,380
He..

133
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,900
I have something to tell you.

134
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,340
What?

135
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,540
What was that?

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,700
So there was a trap after all.

137
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,360
You're a pretty ugly old man!

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,060
Grandpa! I've brought Reiko and the others!

139
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,860
What?!

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,720
Thank you for coming!

141
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,280
Congratulations on your opening!

142
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,660
Thank you! Thank you!

143
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,980
You're as lively as a cockroach.

144
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,360
Stop that!

145
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,760
Let's take a look inside.

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,260
This is the Ninja Museum.

147
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,460
It's a store, isn't it?

148
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,200
It's the same as the Kyushu house we visited before.

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,820
They sell books, too.

150
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,900
It's not exactly the same.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,540
This time, they're selling new shurikens.

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,780
What new shuriken is this?

153
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,260
It's an ordinary shuriken.

154
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,920
It's painted with fluorescent paint.

155
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,900
It shines at night and you can tell when it's the right time.

156
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,820
It's like a light-bulb.

157
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,860
You don't have to worry about fighting in the night.

158
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,880
You can see the enemy, though.

159
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,500
This is the latest in self-defense.

160
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,440
First, you cut it with a knife.

161
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,400
You can also use a pencil.

162
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
You can also use a saw.

163
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,580
And a hammer.

164
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,900
A saw.

165
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,220
If you combine two pieces, you can use scissors.

166
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,200
And a round-shaped magnet.

167
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,180
How is it?

168
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,940
It's good, right?

169
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
A ten-point knife is still better.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,100
I slipped.

172
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,320
You did it on purpose.

173
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,880
How about some herbal tea?

174
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,320
Thank you.

175
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Wait a minute.

176
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,280
This pattern.

177
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,120
No way.

178
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
It contains only one herb that can remove poison.

179
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,420
Huh?

181
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,580
It's a training to distinguish poison.

182
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,440
It's like a Russian roulette.

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,660
Then I'll...

184
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,440
Wait, wait.

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,820
I'll choose first.

186
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,760
If I get in the last one, I'll be in trouble.

187
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,980
Okay, this one.

188
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,820
It's good.

189
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,260
Grandpa, that's it, right?

190
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,940
Yeah.

191
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
A big hit.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,920
What are you going to do?

193
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,840
I drank it all.

194
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,580
Don't worry.

195
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I have a medicine to stop the kick.

196
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
It's a holy water from the sword.

197
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,580
It's perfect for you.

198
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,760
It's 1,500 yen.

199
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,700
It's too expensive.

200
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,060
Then I'll enjoy the low price.

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,620
I understand.

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,220
I'll buy it.

203
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,720
Grandpa, isn't this a poisonous bird's head?

204
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,000
I was surprised.

206
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,380
Don't be surprised.

207
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,500
No, it might be garlic.

208
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,640
Actually, I don't know either.

209
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,500
I don't know.

210
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,720
Don't make me drink herbal tea.

211
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,860
Let's check it out.

212
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,520
It's poison after all.

213
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,960
If you look closely, the first one I put in wasn't a poisonous bird's head.

214
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,880
Look it up.

215
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm not thirsty right now.

216
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,780
I'll hold it back, too.

217
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,040
That means you've been poisoned at an early age.

218
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm in a bad mood.

219
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,340
I've been okay until now.

220
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,580
It's okay.

221
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,420
What?

222
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,520
What? You're still not a student?

223
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,980
Yeah, sometimes when the students come, they stop without even spending an hour.

224
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,580
Of course.

225
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,980
But it's a bit sad.

226
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,860
They came all the way to Tokyo.

227
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,480
I want to help them somehow.

228
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
That's right.

229
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,300
Actually, there's not a single student left.

230
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,140
Please, be the first student!

231
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,880
Why me?

232
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,860
If there's no student, we won't be able to go to school.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,560
Please! Please! Please!

234
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,200
Stop it! Don't get close to Gao!

235
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,140
I'm sorry, Ryo-chan.

236
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,520
You're so pitiful.

237
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,920
I'll pay for the transfer.

238
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,560
You don't have to say that.

239
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,820
Let's do a 10% transfer fee for the students who are going to school.

240
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,900
Really?

241
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,100
Okay, I got it.

242
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,960
I'll go in.

243
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,940
See? This is the technique of convincing a student.

244
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay.

245
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,900
Please, you two.

246
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,560
Please go to school.

247
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,720
Th-that's...

248
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,600
No, wait!

249
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,800
Let's get all the staff to go to school.

250
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,800
What?

251
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,200
Is that possible?

252
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,640
I see.

253
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,220
I'll have you apply it as a formal martial art technique like kendo or judo.

254
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,500
Yeah.

255
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,760
I see.

256
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,580
So that's the plan.

257
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,640
This guy might be able to make a lot of money.

258
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,520
Hmm...

259
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,640
Yes, I think it'd be interesting for police officers to learn the formal martial arts.

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
I think it'd be useful depending on how you use it.

261
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,080
What about you, Ryo-chan?

262
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,920
You wouldn't go out in front of the school, would you?

263
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,280
But...

264
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,640
What?

265
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Ah...

266
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,940
Ah...

267
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,880
*evil laugh*

268
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,560
Ryotsu, where are you?

269
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,900
I am here.

270
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,320
This is the Mokuton Jutsu.

271
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,540
It can be used when you are in a beautiful state or when you are in a tough situation.

272
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh.

273
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,460
I am not sure if it can really be used.

274
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,380
Well, we will see the secret of the combat style ninjutsu from now on.

275
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:27,820
Hmm.

276
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,300
By the way, which is that Kogaremaru-san?

277
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,620
Ah...

278
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,480
Hahahaha!

279
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,800
I am here!

280
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,200
Where?

281
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,000
Where are you looking? Up there!

282
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
Huh? Up there?

283
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,260
Hahahaha!

284
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,340
I am the chief of the combat style ninjutsu school, Saigo Kogaremaru!

285
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,020
Ah! That's dangerous!

286
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,440
It's okay. I was riding it every day in Kyushu.

287
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,160
We are going there now.

288
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,900
Go!

289
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,860
Oh!

290
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,340
The secret of the Mokuton Jutsu!

291
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,160
Ah! That's dangerous!

292
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,960
Hahaha! Don't worry!

293
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
Gyaaah!

294
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Ah! Ouch!

295
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,280
Are you okay? Hurry up and get an ambulance!

296
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,820
Ah, don't worry. It's just a scratch.

297
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,220
Then, I will give you an ambulance box.

298
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
I don't need that.

299
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,480
The ninja is walking with the medicine on him.

300
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,660
Hey!

301
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,500
It says it's a drug for constipation.

302
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,180
Ah!

303
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,660
Ah!

304
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,900
Then, this one?

305
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,420
Or, maybe this one?

306
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,080
Hmm... Is it this one?

307
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,320
It's like a drug store in Toyama.

308
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,240
But, the essential medicine is not coming out.

309
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
Hey! It's troublesome!

310
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,320
If you eat spinach, you will be healthy.

311
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,060
Gyaaah!

312
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,340
Gyaaah!

313
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,700
Hmm?

314
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,660
It's like a Popeye.

315
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,600
What kind of person is he?

316
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,560
Why is he carrying the medicine?

317
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,740
Hmm...

318
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,500
Then, please enter the dojo.

319
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,000
Then, I will show you the ninja's technique.

320
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,160
Reiko is not here yet.

321
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,180
He might be in a hurry to change.

322
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
No, no.

323
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,860
I can't believe it.

324
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Ah, I'm glad.

325
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,680
You are done changing, Reiko-san.

326
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,100
Ah!

327
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,680
Ah!

328
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,840
Barbar!

329
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,460
Ah!

330
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,960
Re-Reiko-san, what's the matter with your outfit?

331
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,280
Is this the family of the Kunoichi?

332
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,020
Yeah.

333
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,560
It's a great Kunoichi.

334
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,680
What is this Kunoichi?

335
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,940
It's a huge ear to search for enemies.

336
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,600
It's a smelly ear to protect himself.

337
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Gyaaah!

338
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,480
Gyaaah!

339
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,540
And the enemy is Kunoichi.

340
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,520
I see.

341
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,360
Oh, my.

342
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,940
Ahem.

343
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,040
It's true that it's a charming family.

344
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,740
But some of the female members are not at all happy about it.

345
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,360
I see.

346
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,340
It's a shame.

347
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,540
It's a shame.

348
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,360
Hmm?

349
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,160
No.

350
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
Ah...

351
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,900
Ah...

352
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,740
The next day.

353
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,920
The next day.

354
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,340
The next day.

355
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,900
The next day.

356
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,060
The next day.

357
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,380
That is, where the popular place is, the weapon of the parasol.

358
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,680
Hmm.

359
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,140
We must hide under the ground and search for enemies.

360
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,460
For intrusion operations it is very convenient, isn't it?

361
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,500
It's said to be "under the ground",

362
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,620
but there are almost no ground in Tokyo.

363
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,040
Hmm.

364
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,860
Let's see how to use the rain clouds.

365
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,520
They cross the river without wetting the clothes.

366
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,600
Isn't the conversation fast?

367
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,460
It's faster, isn't it?

368
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,080
If the waves stand a little, it will turn around.

369
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:10,200
If you say so, I'll show you a special ninja technique.

370
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,100
Are you doing that?

371
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,420
Yeah. Ninja technique, Katon no Jutsu.

372
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,200
It's a technique that blows fire from the mouth and makes the opponent sway.

373
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,500
It should be applied to arresting criminals.

374
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,180
Oh, I can expect a little.

375
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,500
Let's go. First, put a special liquid in your mouth.

376
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,880
It's like a human pump.

377
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,120
I can't rely on you, ninja.

378
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,840
rows

379
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,340
this story

380
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Let's let it go.

381
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,840
Ryotsu, you're not just playing.

382
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,940
I'm doing my job seriously.

383
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,700
What are you doing?

384
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,940
It's a great deal to make it ' Ingredients.

385
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,940
Because . . .

386
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,480
Sometimes I fail.

387
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,420
if this

388
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,560
But this is the least we can expect from the police.

389
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,200
We could just show them what a ninja can do to help the police.

390
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,760
Yeah!

391
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,980
Then we can arrest the criminal with our ninja skills!

392
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,460
Oh, that's a good idea!

393
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
Let's do it!

394
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,220
Are you ready?

395
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, I'm ready anytime!

396
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,440
Start!

397
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh! This is a good view!

398
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,040
Hello?

399
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,040
Hello?

400
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,860
Hello?

401
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm Manegaru.

402
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
Be sure to keep an eye on the suspicious people.

403
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,380
I know!

404
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,920
You should take a little more action.

405
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,820
Hey, isn't that a little too much?

406
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,100
Tokyo has a lot of tall views.

407
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
It's not over yet.

408
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,400
Huh?

409
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,860
Grandpa!

410
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,180
Hey, do something!

411
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,480
Don't worry.

412
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll do something about it.

413
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,920
Minpo!

414
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Come back my taco-kun!

415
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Daaah!

416
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,400
Let's chase them!

417
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,220
Now, how far are you going to be carried?

418
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,020
Huh?

419
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,720
What's going on?

420
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,680
It's me!

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,060
Senpai, this is terrible!

422
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,980
Huh?

423
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,800
We have caught a drug dealer at the main court...

424
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,620
The culprit ran away in the car! He ran into our ship! Please return immediately!

425
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,700
But even if you tell me to return immediately...

426
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,020
Huh? Wait a minute! This is a great machine that will show our power!

427
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,580
Nakagawa! What is the characteristic of the culprit's car?

428
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,960
Black sedan! It looks like a foreigner!

429
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,860
What is that?

430
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,360
What did you say?

431
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,140
They are trying to escape by helicopter!

432
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,300
They will be caught by us no matter what!

433
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,700
Oh!

434
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,900
Damn it! I can't make it in time!

435
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,480
Go ahead! Go ahead!

436
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,080
I can't help you at all!

437
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,720
I did it! This is the wind of God!

438
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080
I won't let you get away!

439
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,240
Take this!

440
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,420
Oh! Japanese Ninja!

441
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,020
No! It's not working at all!

442
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,120
Aaaaaaah!

443
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,480
Ninja!

444
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,580
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

445
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,140
Hey, old man.

446
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Ninnins won't be working in this era after all!

447
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,520
What? Not yet?

448
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,860
I never expected that there were still ninjas in Japan.

449
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,840
But they weren't our enemy.

450
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,600
I didn't mean to!

451
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,740
What's that sound?

452
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,740
I didn't know you had something like this!

453
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,900
This is the giant shuriken magic!

454
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,140
This is the giant shuriken magic!

455
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Finish him!

456
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,580
To drop a helicopter with a shuriken...

457
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,480
What a terrifying magic!

458
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,100
Hey, hey! That cannon...

459
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,980
Maybe it's a bad omen!

460
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,060
Ta-da!

461
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,120
My school!

462
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,960
Again?

463
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,520
I was so lucky to get a chance to make money!

464
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,440
Isn't something clicking?

465
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,380
Come to think of it...

466
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,800
Ah! No!

467
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,520
The self-destruct device switched on in that shock!

468
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,500
Why did you put that on?

469
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,640
It's the ninja's basic!

470
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,420
Get rid of it right away!

471
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,780
It's too late!

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,620
It'll explode in 5 seconds!

473
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,460
I do appreciate the fact that you arrested the culprit.

474
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,600
But...

475
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,120
There's a lot of protest from the people around here!

476
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,580
I know!

477
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,760
That's why I'm writing this paper!

478
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,200
Where did your grandpa go?

479
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,740
He just went back to Kyushu.

480
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
As expected of a ninja.

481
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,020
He's fast at running away.

482
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,460
Farewell!

483
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,420
See you again!

484
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,120
You're going with Mom!

485
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,260
Awright!

486
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,360
We just got back from Kyushu.

487
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,020
I'm on my way to Kyushu!

488
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,620
You're coming with me, too!

489
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,360
Okay!

490
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,960
I'm going with you!

491
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,020
I walked through the dark side of the arcade

492
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:52,700
Everyone was a kid once, but they all forgot

493
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,640
A politician with a big face and a blue aunt on top of his eyes

494
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,060
Turn around and look at that corner

495
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,360
You'll meet everyone

496
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,420
There's a turtle over there

497
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,200
There must be a turtle

498
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,000
Everyone, come to our town

499
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,440
Thank you!

500
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,680
What? You bought a cruiser?

501
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,380
Yes, I wanted to take the time to naturally interact with the children

502
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,120
So you suddenly bought a cruiser

503
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,220
You're a life-saving band, but you're a home steal from Manrei

504
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,820
Next time on Papa is a Young Master

505
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,780
There's a turtle over there

506
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,800
There must be a turtle

507
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,680
Everyone, come to our town

508
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,260
Thank you!

509
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you!
