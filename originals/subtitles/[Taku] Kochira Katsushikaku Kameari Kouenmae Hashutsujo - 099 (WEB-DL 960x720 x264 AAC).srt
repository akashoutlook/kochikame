1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,800
What Iiam Matt

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,300
"When you're watching TV"

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,820
"Please make the room bright and look away."

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,460
"When you're watching TV"

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,980
I wasn't a good child so I didn't know what a girl was like.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,260
I kicked the ground and flew to the pit

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,320
I wonder if I'm going to be paid for it

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,420
I was laughed at as it was

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,040
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,740
There is only a thorn

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,340
There is no change in my yawn

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape is strangely gentle

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,500
From the waterfront of the Tongari City

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,560
The sun sets to Taishakuten

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,880
Tomorrow will end like this

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,720
Tomorrow will end like this

17
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,400
If I were to be the Kazushika

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
I would be so happy

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,980
I was so stupid that I realized

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,360
I was the one who lost

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,800
Absolute destiny, the final episode

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,600
One hour, eight seconds

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,180
One hour, eight seconds

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,100
One hour, eight seconds

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,060
One hour, eight seconds

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,900
One hour, eight seconds

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,500
One hour, eight seconds

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,300
One hour, eight seconds

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,620
One hour, eight seconds

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,380
One hour, eight seconds

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,900
One hour, eight seconds

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,600
One hour, eight seconds

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,080
One hour, eight seconds

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,160
One hour, eight seconds

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,760
One hour, eight seconds

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,340
One hour, eight seconds

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,960
One hour, eight seconds

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,520
One hour, eight seconds

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,140
One hour, eight seconds

40
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,660
One hour, eight seconds

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,420
One hour, eight seconds

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,700
One hour, eight seconds

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:13,840
One hour, eight seconds

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,260
One hour, eight seconds

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,940
One hour, eight seconds

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,720
One hour, eight seconds

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,980
One hour, eight seconds

48
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,540
One hour, eight seconds

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,080
One hour, eight seconds

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,540
One hour, eight seconds

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,760
One hour, eight seconds

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not going to do it.

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,060
I understand.

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
I understand the position of the staff.

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,640
Yes, you two.

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm stressed at work.

57
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,500
Isn't it?

58
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,760
That's right.

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,980
I'm stressed.

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,980
The boss is a bastard.

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,800
Look at that face.

62
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,740
Tsukamoto-kun.

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,540
It's not good for the brain.

64
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,340
I told you.

65
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,500
If you're a brain,

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
It doesn't matter about quality.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
You bastard.

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,820
Right?

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,380
That's why I'm stressed.

70
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,560
How about a full-time job?

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,980
It's cute.

72
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,200
That's perfect.

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,140
I'll find you a good job.

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,340
A good job.

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,100
All right.

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Iketa-kun.

77
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,580
Tatsugi.

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,480
I'll be your friend.

79
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,600
Yes, sir.

80
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,440
Please come in.

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,120
Come in.

82
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,060
We have a guest.

83
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,000
Captain.

84
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,540
Captain.

85
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,060
You're here, too?

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,000
That's unexpected.

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,780
We're a parent business.

88
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,160
Please come in.

89
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,580
Stupid.

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm not here as a guest.

91
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm here to report that there's a person

92
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,780
wearing the police uniform and calling me.

93
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,160
Are you the one who came to see me?

94
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,720
What are you doing?

95
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,820
It's my part-time job.

96
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,760
Is it?

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,160
Why do you have a part-time job?

98
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,260
It's for the convenience of the people around here.

99
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,200
That's because you're using games and radicons,

100
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,780
don't you?

101
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,880
No.

102
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,260
My business is...

103
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,220
Captain.

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,320
If the director finds out about this,

105
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,280
my company will be in trouble.

106
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,220
Just come.

107
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,920
Just wait, I need to work for an hour or I won't be able to get a part-time job.

108
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,780
Shut up, you troublemaker!

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,680
What? He called a cabaret while he was working?

110
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,160
In this outfit?

111
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,280
Ryo-sama, I'm not the type of person to work in a place where there are so many girls!

112
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,100
Don't you have any self-awareness as a policeman?

113
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm not the type of person to work in a place where there are so many girls!

114
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm not the type of person to work in a place where there are so many girls!

115
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,840
Life is so hard.

116
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,540
I have no choice but to be happy!

117
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Ryo-sama, you're so pitiful.

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,100
I know, Maria.

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,220
But work is a violation of the rules.

120
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
If you continue, you'll be fired.

121
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,960
If you continue, you'll be fired.

122
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,540
If you don't work, you'll die, so it can't be helped!

123
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,460
If I continue, I'll be fired.

124
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,200
If you need that much money, why don't you work in a office?

125
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
If you need that much money, why don't you work in a office?

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,660
How about working on a part-time job or helping with the internal finances?

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
In the office?

128
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,540
But I can't go home without money.

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,660
I'll do it! Let me do it!

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,900
The chief is a true man of life!

131
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
That's too much!

132
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, that's much more reassuring for me!

133
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,840
I won't forget your kindness, Ryo and Kankichi!

134
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,480
No, not at all...

135
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:33,040
I won't forget your kindness, Ryo and Kankichi!

136
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,320
A part-time job is like buying a car,

137
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,220
but it costs 360 yen for one car.

138
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,380
I hate it.

139
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,840
I don't know. I need to fill up the gas tank.

140
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,760
It's a pain to move the car one by one.

141
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,280
Oh, right.

142
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm so smart.

143
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
Wait a minute!

144
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,940
Ryo-tsu! Kankichi!

145
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,580
It's dangerous! What's the matter?

146
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,420
Oh, you're being considerate.

147
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,700
I wonder if the number one man who was hated has changed his mind a little.

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,940
Here's a mixture of dried shiso and fruit.

149
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,480
Thank you!

150
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
It looks delicious!

151
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,840
I've finished eating.

152
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,260
Well, then, here's your bill.

153
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,180
Your bill?

154
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes, the consumption tax.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,660
It's 15,750 yen including tax.

156
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,640
What is this?

157
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,280
There's no way I can pay for this!

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh, you can't pay for this.

159
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,500
This is a problem, sir.

160
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm saying that you can't pay for this.

161
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,220
The ladies are doing a lot of service.

162
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,360
Isn't it too much to say that you don't pay?

163
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah.

164
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,900
Now, pay while you're being nice.

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,760
Idiot! You're the worst!

166
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,620
Don't joke around, you idiot!

167
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,840
You stinky shijin!

168
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,940
Don't play minicompo alone!

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
Damn it! I ran away!

170
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll remember that!

171
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,120
Huh?

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,880
Chief!

173
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Ryo-tsu! What were you doing?

174
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,360
Were you watching me?

175
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,220
Chief, you're a bad person.

176
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
If you're here, you're here.

177
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,180
Idiot!

178
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
You're the one who said that you're the catcher in the book!

179
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,540
You idiot!

180
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,660
But my life is worth one and a half hundred and sixty yen.

181
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,220
That's...

182
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,620
Shut up!

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,540
You're useless!

184
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,320
Oh, no!

185
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,360
The gas!

186
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,740
Ryo-tsu!

187
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,280
Hold the bird!

188
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
Damn it!

189
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,580
I'll do it myself!

190
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,460
I'll do it myself!

191
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,380
Ryo-tsu!

192
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,840
Go!

193
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Oh, dear!

194
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,640
You know, the other day...

195
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,360
Oh, dear!

196
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,200
Oh, dear!

197
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,000
Ryo-tsu!

198
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,120
Oh, dear!

199
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,220
Oh, dear!

200
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,220
Oh, dear!

201
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,960
Hello, Akashi!

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,580
I apologize!

203
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm sorry!

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,340
I'm truly sorry!

205
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,440
I won't!

206
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you for the trouble!

208
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Ohara, what's going on?

209
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,820
Ryozu did this...

210
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,140
What are you talking about?

211
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,240
The boss threw me out.

212
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,620
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,320
I did that because you did that.

214
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,080
What are you talking about?

215
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
The boss made me write the deadline.

216
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,180
I got a bonus.

217
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,800
You're not going to get a deadline because you don't do it.

218
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,300
You idiot.

219
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,300
Idiot, idiot.

220
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,300
That's one of the reasons why I'm an idiot.

221
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,520
Idiot, idiot.

222
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,440
Don't call me an idiot.

223
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,940
You're a guaranteed idiot.

224
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,380
Stop it, you idiot.

225
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,040
It's your responsibility.

226
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
You two will take responsibility for this.

227
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,140
What?

228
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,600
Ryo and Ohara?

229
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,600
The boss threw me out?

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
That's right.

231
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,160
The boss and Ryo will be transferred to Hirani.

232
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,940
They'll be transferred to a different place.

233
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm glad you're done with that.

234
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,900
I was worried you'd get fired.

235
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,220
I'll definitely go to see Ryo for lunch on my high school day.

236
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,700
That's impossible.

237
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,740
Why?

238
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,000
There's a problem with that transfer.

239
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,160
Problem?

240
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,440
If I had to go to that place, I'd rather get fired.

241
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,280
Where are you two going?

242
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,320
To the end of the world.

243
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,380
What?

244
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,300
To the end of the world?

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,520
That's right.

246
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,040
The end of the world is an island without a map, a legendary place on the island.

247
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,440
The island is surrounded by cliffs and you can't get close by boat.

248
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,960
It's a disaster.

249
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,460
Once you go there, you can't go back alive.

250
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,500
You're a fool.

251
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,260
You're a fool.

252
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,420
You're a fool.

253
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,080
There's no place to go.

254
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,700
Move.

255
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,440
Now.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,220
You

257
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,420
What was that?

258
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,880
Not now.

259
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,040
Tixie.

260
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,200
What is this place?

261
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,500
It's a jungle where no one has stepped on.

262
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,600
It doesn't matter if there are dinosaurs or birds on the ground.

263
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,400
This is the end.

264
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,720
It's a jungle where no one has stepped on.

265
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,780
It's like a dream.

266
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,420
Is this the place where people live?

267
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
It's so dusty.

268
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
Oh, it's the west.

269
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,640
The last date is...

270
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
10 years after the Great Shogunate.

271
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,300
The last date is...

272
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,520
No one's coming.

273
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,460
No one's coming.

274
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,440
I don't have time to play.

275
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,960
I need to get a pass.

276
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,420
Who's a pass?

277
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,480
Then I'll decide on patrol.

278
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,060
If you go out alone,

279
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,220
you might not be able to come back.

280
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,660
Then I'll go to the mayor.

281
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,180
Then I'll go to the mayor.

282
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,000
It's an island without people.

283
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,820
Only the two of us live here.

284
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
Oh, oh, oh.

285
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,380
Then what would the two of us do?

286
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,260
Then I'll tell you.

287
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,560
The first thing you should do in an islandless life is that...

288
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,080
That is?

289
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,100
That is to be sure of drinking water.

290
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,480
Drinking water?

291
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,200
For humans to live, water is first required.

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,080
If it's an island like this, there's a difference of spring and water.

293
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,560
The first thing is to find it.

294
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
That's the first thing.

295
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,500
I see.

296
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
That's very informative.

297
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,500
Okay, then, water.

298
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,060
Bring me some water, Ryotsu.

299
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,420
Huh?

300
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,440
No, I'm not saying "huh".

301
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm telling you, Ryotsu.

302
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,220
Bring me some water, now!

303
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,440
Chief, no, Ohara-kun.

304
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,780
O-Ohara-kun!

305
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,600
You've become a hira-junsa like me, Ohara-kun.

306
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,740
I hope you don't have to order me around.

307
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,260
We're on the same side, so we have to do everything equally, Ohara-kun.

308
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,520
Okay, let's go together.

309
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,000
Is this okay, Ryotsu-kun?

310
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,840
If you don't want to, you can go by yourself, Ohara-kun.

311
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,000
No, not at all.

312
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,380
Wait, don't go by yourself, Ryotsu.

313
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,540
No, Ryotsu-kun.

314
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,280
Wait, Ryotsu-kun.

315
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,540
Huh?

316
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
You're the one who's counting on me for survival.

317
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,180
You?

318
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,240
No, no, it's Ryotsu-kun.

319
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,600
You're counting on me, Ryotsu-kun.

320
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,720
What's wrong, Ryotsu-kun?

321
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,100
No, I can hear a faint sound of water from the other side of the bush.

322
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,460
Okay, let's go.

323
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
Wait, Ryotsu-kun!

324
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,600
Wait, Ryotsu-kun!

325
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,520
What's this place?

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,940
A lake.

327
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,080
But somehow, it's getting a little quiet.

328
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,340
It's like we're in a Nessie movie.

329
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Ryotsu-kun, something's coming out of there.

330
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,760
I knew it, Nessie.

331
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,760
No, it's the end of the island, so it's the end, right?

332
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,280
What a boring thing.

333
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,580
It's just a tree, isn't it?

334
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,300
Let's go back home with some water, Ohara-kun.

335
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's do that.

336
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,660
Ohara-kun, let's take this bucket.

337
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,360
If we lose at rock-paper-scissors, we'll have to hold it for 500 times.

338
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,080
What? Rock-paper-scissors?

339
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,340
No?

340
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,520
No, not like that.

341
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,200
497, 498, 499, 500.

342
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,280
Rock-paper-scissors!

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,420
Rock-paper-scissors!

344
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,380
We won again.

345
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,540
Let's go.

346
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,200
Wait, Ryotsu-kun.

347
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,640
Can you let us rest a little longer?

348
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,300
I can't help it.

349
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,540
Just a little longer.

350
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,660
Typhoon No. 17, which has a large and very strong force,

351
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,360
has changed its course from east to west,

352
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,060
and is approaching the Japanese archipelago.

353
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
If we keep going this way, the typhoon will hit the end of the island.

354
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,840
Will we be okay, Lord?

355
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,580
It seems to be a pretty strong typhoon.

356
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
Are we going to hold it in such a shabby house?

357
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,680
We've reinforced it anyway.

358
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,520
As expected of you, Ryotsu-kun.

359
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,080
You're so reliable.

360
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,660
But the problem is this.

361
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,740
There's only this much we can find and eat.

362
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,980
Come to think of it, I'm hungry.

363
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,500
I haven't eaten anything since I came to the island.

364
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,440
So if you eat it as you desire,

365
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,820
the food will soon be there.

366
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,020
R-right.

367
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
I think it's good to put together all the food we brought together,

368
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,640
and then share them a little by little.

369
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,060
I see. That's a good idea.

370
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,140
But I only have this much.

371
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,060
I only have this much.

372
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,120
What's this?

373
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
There's only manga and plastic.

374
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,920
How rude.

375
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,480
See? I have a can.

376
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,540
And...

377
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,640
a candy.

378
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,740
Only those two?

379
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,700
Yes.

380
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,060
Alright, now we have all the food we need.

381
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,020
That's almost all the food I brought.

382
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,160
For now, the disaster prevention equipment is okay.

383
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,540
And then...

384
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,120
And then?

385
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,240
To save our stamina and not make us hungry,

386
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,060
we have to sleep.

387
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,300
Sleep...

388
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,800
Let's do it!

389
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,160
That's annoying...

390
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,360
So!

391
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,300
Chief!

392
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,440
You really thought this was it?

393
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,000
No, I just want you to check the contents.

394
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,220
I just wanted to help.

395
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,080
You can't believe that!

396
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,860
This is the farthest place from you.

397
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,600
What the hell?

398
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,580
Be careful, Ryotsu!

399
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,440
Ryotsu!

400
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,760
Chief!

401
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,960
Half of this house is on the sea!

402
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,200
What?

403
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,180
It's not strange for it to fall into the sea after breaking the balance.

404
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,100
You don't have time to rest, Ryotsu!

405
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,020
Hurry over here!

406
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,520
Ryotsu!

407
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,940
Ryotsu!

408
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,100
Don't eat that!

409
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,600
Don't eat that!

410
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,540
What are you going to do now, Ryotsu?

411
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,740
Look, Chief.

412
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,520
The floor to the door is about four meters long.

413
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
It's a distance that can reach two people if you connect them vertically.

414
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,840
I see.

415
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,320
All right, come on!

416
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,160
Now!

417
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,720
Come on, I already got you.

418
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,780
Hurry on!

419
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,940
Hurry up!

420
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,820
I'll take care of it for you!

421
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,500
Okay!

422
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,040
It's with you!

423
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,000
What are you doing?

424
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,120
Hey!

425
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,740
Stop!

426
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,120
Wait, hey!

427
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
What are you doing?

428
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,240
Go ahead and do something!

429
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,520
Go take care of it.

430
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,100
Come on!

431
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:42,000
Crap, I'm going to получилось...

432
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,600
Yay!

433
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
Once more...

434
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:00,720
Once more...

435
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,240
Yay!

436
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:06,820
Ugh!

437
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,800
If two people go there at once, they'll turn around.

438
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,600
Let's go outside first.

439
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm sorry because you're going up.

440
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,940
I understand.

441
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,960
It seems to be fine.

442
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,940
What's wrong?

443
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,800
I can't go back.

444
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,500
This way.

445
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,300
What should I do?

446
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,960
Don't come here.

447
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,980
I don't need this bag.

448
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:47,980
No, sir.

449
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,340
I don't need it.

450
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,060
I don't need it.

451
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,020
It hurts.

452
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,740
I don't want to die.

453
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,280
Sir.

454
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:15,720
I'm so hungry because I moved so much.

455
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm dying of hunger.

456
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,280
Sir, let's eat.

457
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,660
I can't stand it anymore.

458
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
Idiot, go back.

459
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,900
Do you really want to die?

460
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,300
But if you can't move, you'll die of hunger.

461
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm hungry, too.

462
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
I want to eat.

463
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,100
Idiot, go back.

464
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,940
Let's do this.

465
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,040
Let's get closer to each other at the same time.

466
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,760
Then the balance won't fall.

467
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,220
Let's do this.

468
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,580
1...

469
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,080
2...

470
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,920
3...

471
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,000
4...

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,340
5...

473
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,540
15...

474
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,860
16...

475
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:53,940
18...

476
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,660
19...

477
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,020
I'm dead!

478
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:21,700
It's like yesterday was a lie.

479
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,460
It's a typhoon.

480
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,540
Ryo, are you okay?

481
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,580
It's a typhoon.

482
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,280
I caught it.

483
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,300
I caught it.

484
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,520
I caught it.

485
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:38,860
Don't say that.

486
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,380
I caught it.

487
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,160
It was a long time ago.

488
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,380
It was a long time ago.

489
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,000
The captain is a typhoon.

490
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,480
What?

491
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,420
You are my prey.

492
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,420
I'm hungry, so I'll stop.

493
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,420
I'm hungry, so I'll stop.

494
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,880
That's right.

495
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm hungry, so I'll stop.

496
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:58,960
Or else.

497
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm hungry, so I'll stop.

498
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
This is my brother's evil power.

499
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,100
This is my brother's evil power.

500
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,400
This is my brother's evil power.

501
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
This is my brother's evil power.

502
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,660
Will the captain's evil power stop?

503
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,000
I can't run.

504
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,580
It's not over yet!

505
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,500
What?

506
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,580
Next time, I'm the star!

507
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,720
Hoshi Touden, you bastard!

508
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:14,980
Next time, I'm the star!

509
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,780
Next time, I'm the star!
