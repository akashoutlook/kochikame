1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
When you watch TV

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,160
Make the room brighter and look away

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:21,340
It's like someone is calling

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,260
After the rain

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,080
I walked looking back

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,580
I held my mother's hand

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,060
As I walked home

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,720
I felt

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,580
A strange feeling

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,400
So I tried to walk

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,100
On the black tile of the arcade

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:55,420
I was a child once

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,060
But everyone was a child

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,280
I was a politician with a big face

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,300
And a blue aunt

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,300
Look around

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,280
At the corner

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,880
You can meet everyone

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,620
There's a wall over there

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,420
There must be a wall

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,360
Come on everyone

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,540
Let's go to our town

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,660
Thank you!

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,800
Good morning.

25
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,180
Good morning.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,340
Good morning.

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,380
What?

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,560
Did you drop the contact lens?

29
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm looking for the spine of number 52.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,480
What is that?

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,440
It's a dinosaur model.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,520
I need one.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,960
OK.

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,000
You guys

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,640
During work

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,660
This is

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,860
Ryo

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,000
Captain, just like that

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,140
I found it.

40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,040
This is it.

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,660
This is the spine of number 52.

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,660
This completes the Brontosaurus.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,700
Don't make such things during work.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,580
Captain

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,720
Senpai is a teacher at elementary school

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,860
I'm made by being asked.

47
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,580
What?

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,100
The number of parts is 148

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,360
Because it is a precise model.

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,920
I can't make it with an amateur.

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,540
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,020
To make it exactly

53
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
It's more difficult than jigsaw.

54
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,060
Moreover, Captain

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,620
This morning I separated the parts from the runner

56
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,860
When I painted and dried it

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,620
I was very surprised

58
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,240
I was surprised

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,260
I was surprised

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,100
I was surprised

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,140
I was surprised

62
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,480
I was surprised

63
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,600
I was surprised

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,300
I was surprised

65
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,880
I was surprised

66
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,440
There was a problem

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,000
I haven't seen you in a long time.

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,120
I have never seen it.

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,220
Thank you.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,240
I think it will be a bad expression.

71
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,300
I can't see it.

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,380
I've seen it in a long time.

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
I don't know the Death-Sword

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,420
I have never seen it.

75
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,940
The pain of Saraha

76
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:23,300
Kouji

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,220
Let's go to the tent.

78
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,820
It's too much to pay for it alone.

79
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,020
I thought you had a problem with the change of the mayor.

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
Of course not. It's the duty of the people.

81
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,040
-Okay? Pay it properly. -Okay.

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,420
Oh, that's right.

83
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,380
Senpai, our Nakagawa Enterprise is going to hold a dinosaur exhibition.

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,680
Do you want to come see it?

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,900
Really? I'll go.

86
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,800
Pay the tax and then go.

87
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,260
Okay, I understand.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,520
I don't want to be complained by the people of Chiba.

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,700
Did you say something?

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,740
No, nothing.

91
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm going to patrol Ryotsu Prefecture.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,160
That idiot.

93
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,800
After all, the real thing is different.

94
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,680
It's different.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,580
I want it.

96
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,020
What? You can't.

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,020
I'm not saying I want this.

98
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,720
I want a mold.

99
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,100
A mold?

100
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,120
Yes, a mold.

101
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,840
It's possible if you help me.

102
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,000
Let me have a look.

103
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,500
What?

104
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,920
I killed it.

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,540
Senpai, don't break it.

106
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,980
It's okay. Don't worry.

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
What would you do with a bone mold?

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,920
I want to make the same thing.

109
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,020
When I say that, I don't want to delay.

110
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,020
It's terrible.

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,140
That's the end of the Prontozaurus.

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,760
Let's go back.

113
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,920
What are you talking?

114
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,080
I'm still waiting for this.

115
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,280
Are you doing it?

116
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,900
Next is the Tyrannosaurus.

117
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,200
I'll never have a chance to take a mold from a real thing.

118
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,060
I'll take it all this time.

119
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,180
Yeah.

120
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,200
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,780
I go every night.

122
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,640
To the bone marrow.

123
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,380
It's been a while since I took a break.

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,420
I guess I'll go on a date with Nana-chan today.

125
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,400
Mr. Honda!

126
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,340
What's up with you since early in the morning?

127
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,880
I'm in the garden.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm in the garden.

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm in the garden.

130
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,460
Oh, Mr. Ryosu is building the skeleton of the dinosaurs.

131
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,040
Huh? Senpai is?

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
I really wanted to have this as an object in Ryo's garden.

133
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,260
With this size, I can decorate five or six bodies.

134
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,760
I see. You're like a senpai.

135
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,220
Hey, Honda.

136
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,880
You must be bored today. Help me.

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,860
No, I was thinking about dating Nana-chan today.

138
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,380
Hey, Honda.

139
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,120
Who was it that made you date Nana?

140
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,340
Oh, that's...

141
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,220
Who was it that comforted you when you were being dumped?

142
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
Senpai.

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,720
When humans are happy, they forget about the past.

144
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,640
I see. I'll help you.

145
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,380
I'll help you.

146
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,300
What? I'm sorry, Honda.

147
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,760
I'll bring you the biggest bone there.

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,320
All right. I'll bring you the biggest bone there. I'll bring you the biggest bone there.

149
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,920
I'll bring you the biggest bone there. I'll bring you the biggest bone there.

150
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,460
No, no. I can't carry myself all alone.

151
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,780
Your bones are huge. What are you talking about?

152
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,980
Oh, it looks light, but it's still light.

153
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,000
It's made of lightweight plastic. And it's got strong insides.

154
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,560
I see.

155
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,260
All right. Put it here.

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,800
Put this back on and hold it tightly.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,040
That's great.

158
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,180
I'm a model maker.

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,660
Can I bring my friends and show them?

160
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,040
Bring them here.

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,900
Bye!

162
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,580
The children will be happy.

163
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,800
Ryo, are you going to make money?

164
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,820
No, don't say that.

165
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,860
This is just a personal hobby.

166
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,020
I'm a model maker.

167
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,380
I have sharp insight.

168
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,480
Wow, you're really good.

169
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,520
You made not only the skeleton,

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,500
but also the skin around it.

171
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,700
How is it?

172
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,120
Isn't it amazing?

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,220
If you complete the Brontosaurus,

174
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,900
you can open it.

175
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,020
It's more powerful than our dinosaur store.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,220
It's because it's expensive.

177
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,440
I made it with the help of a model maker.

178
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,620
I don't pay for the tax,

179
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,540
but I had a lot of money.

180
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,280
No, it's all debt.

181
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,160
This is for the children to see their happy faces.

182
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,000
And it's not a profit.

183
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:28,920
It's not a profit.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,080
It's not a profit.

185
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,040
But it's like a real thing.

186
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,280
It's light for what it looks like.

187
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,560
It's hollow inside.

188
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,660
I see.

189
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,820
I made a mold based on the cast iron I took the other day.

190
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,860
If you have a mold,

191
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,180
you can make as many ponpon as you want.

192
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,820
You can make as many ponpon as you want.

193
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,980
You can make as many ponpon as you want.

194
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,560
As expected of Senpai.

195
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,720
Listen, this is a secret from the director.

196
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,960
Yes, sir.

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,580
Hey, what are you talking about?

198
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,380
Oh, no, it's nothing.

199
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,580
By the way, director,

200
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,480
please look down.

201
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,300
There is a wheel on the foot.

202
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,860
It can be moved when used widely.

203
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,260
I see. You have a lot of ideas.

204
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,640
I do it when I do it.

205
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,500
I do it when I do it.

206
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,180
Hey, Ryo!

207
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,460
Ryo!

208
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,600
The order is coming from all over the country.

209
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,520
More than 10 million black cards.

210
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,840
Oh, no.

211
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,920
He is weak in numbers.

212
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,580
He is mistaken.

213
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,720
He is a trouble.

214
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,760
Pay the public tax quickly.

215
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,280
Pay the public tax quickly.

216
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,060
Yes, sir.

217
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,660
Yes, sir.

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,200
Look,

219
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,380
he made lots of orders from all over the world.

220
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,520
He makes a lot of money.

221
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,520
Whether it's public tax or public tax,

222
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,420
I will pay it.

223
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,640
I will pay it.

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,780
The typhoon 55,

225
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,760
is approaching Kanto region

226
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,660
along the north-eastern route.

227
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,680
We need to be careful.

228
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,520
It's a strong wind.

229
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,820
It's not good to have typhoon in this season.

230
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,820
It's not good to have typhoon in this season.

231
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,100
It's not good to have typhoon in this season.

232
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,700
OK, I'll go out.

233
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,460
Are you patrolling in this wind?

234
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,080
No, I'm going to see the dinosaurs.

235
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,360
If they fall and break,

236
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,400
I'll be in trouble.

237
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,400
You are a person who is easy to be fooled by money.

238
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,500
You are a person who is easy to be fooled by money.

239
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm not going to lose to typhoon.

240
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm not going to lose to typhoon.

241
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,100
Damn it.

242
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,600
Damn it.

243
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,940
Ouch!

244
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,180
Ouch!

245
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,140
Ryo.

246
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,420
You came too.

247
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,600
I'm worried about the dinosaurs because of this wind.

248
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
OK, let's hurry.

249
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,040
Ouch!

250
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,180
Ryo.

251
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,700
What?

252
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,780
What?

253
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,060
What?

254
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,280
What?

255
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,120
It really flew away.

256
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,520
What?

257
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,020
Ouch!

258
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,000
It really flew away.

259
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,740
My design is great.

260
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,580
It's because I made the inside of the bone hollow and raised the cost.

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,780
It's because I made the inside of the bone hollow and raised the cost.

262
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,920
I'll raise the price of Pteranodon's replica.

263
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,520
I'll raise the price of Pteranodon's replica.

264
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,860
No, no, no.

265
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,400
It's not the time to say that.

266
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
It's not the time to say that.

267
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,040
Oh, no.

268
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,800
We're in trouble.

269
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,960
It got away with it.

270
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,620
Aww.

271
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:03,920
Oh, no.

272
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,740
Oh, no.

273
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,560
詠

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,920
Oh, no.

275
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,080
Oh, no.

276
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:23,440
-Azeo is stuck!-

277
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,640
This feels like a怪獣映画!

278
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,780
Here is the Tokyo suburb!

279
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,020
The typhoon 55 that is approaching Tokyo Bay

280
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,920
is even stronger than that!

281
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,520
Huh?

282
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,920
Mr. Camera, how far can you go?

283
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,040
Behind you!

284
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,600
Don't you know what happened?

285
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,840
The typhoon, no, the dinosaurs have landed!

286
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,980
This is bad!

287
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,740
What is it?

288
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,240
The city is in a panic because the dinosaurs have appeared in the suburb.

289
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,060
What?

290
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,000
Dinosaur?

291
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,260
I'm sorry!

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,220
I came to pay the public tax!

293
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,160
Due to the typhoon,

294
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,420
the dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park in Sumida were blown away,

295
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,620
and the suburb was hit by the typhoon.

296
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
The whole city is in trouble.

297
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,640
What happened to Ryotsu?

298
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,280
He got on the Pteranodon and ran into the suburb.

299
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,280
He made something terrible.

300
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,020
Hey, what are you doing?

301
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,520
The T-Rex has destroyed our roof!

302
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,960
We are Block Bay!

303
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,700
You should pay for it!

304
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,700
Because the typhoon is so powerful!

305
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,660
You guys are talking!

306
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,820
Give me the president!

307
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,120
The president is not here!

308
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,500
I won't forgive you!

309
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,000
I will bring the president here right now!

310
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,140
Damn it!

311
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,460
Hey, I'm in a pinch!

312
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,240
If we continue like this, we're going to be gone.

313
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,660
The order came from around the nation.

314
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,400
To get 100 million golj Merci, right?

315
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,340
So, with this incident,

316
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,680
We have cancelled everything.

317
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,780
What?

318
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,100
There is only one way.

319
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,420
We can manage the order if we take an order from all over the world.

320
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,640
But it's not a simple thing!

321
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,280
The debtmonitor is coming to our house!

322
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,900
Herro-san, please make something of it!

323
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,380
It can't be helped!

324
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,440
It was a mistake to calculate the typhoon.

325
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,440
When the sky turned red, you promised to hold half of it.

326
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,340
What is it?

327
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,920
Look at this!

328
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,000
"Discovered at the end of the century? There was a living dinosaur?"

329
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,380
"At the island of the surprised peach, the dinosaur's footprints were discovered?"

330
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,100
It's a lie!

331
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,100
It's the same as Nessie of Nesco, Cushy of Kushiroko and Ishii of Ikedako.

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,280
Look carefully!

333
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,860
Nessie was upset at the picture of the pinball, but this is different.

334
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,280
There are footprints and it's clearly in the picture.

335
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,560
What if it's real?

336
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,640
I'm going to catch this dinosaur.

337
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,280
If you capture a real dinosaur, you can become rich overnight.

338
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,680
Just by showing it, it will become popular like when the panda first came to Japan.

339
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,240
Next, I will make a gay into a circus flower.

340
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,760
Can't you make a gay into a dinosaur?

341
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,140
What are you talking about?

342
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,920
Godzilla also made a gay into a dinosaur.

343
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
I don't know about that.

344
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,580
What? It's a monster war.

345
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,700
You don't know about that?

346
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,200
That's a movie story.

347
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,100
My dictionary doesn't have the word "impossible".

348
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,100
In the end, I will use the current genetic science and increase the number of dinosaurs.

349
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,240
If I make a dinosaur park like Jurassic Park, I will become the richest person in the world.

350
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,240
I'm happy with it.

351
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,800
Senpai, are you seriously looking for a dinosaur?

352
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm not serious.

353
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,040
I can't move my neck because of debt.

354
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,360
I just want to make a fortune.

355
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,980
Why don't you take me too?

356
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,040
You surprised me.

357
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,160
"Nessie'sGANZIGRAPHY GENERATED"

358
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,720
"Nessie'sGANZIGRAPHY GENERATED"

359
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:33,900
"Nessie'sGANZIGRAPHY GENERATED"

360
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,120
"Nessie'sGANZIGRAPHY GENERATED"

361
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,580
It's not an island with dinosaurs, it's more of a tourist attraction.

362
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,480
Well, senpai, please contact me if you catch any dinosaurs.

363
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,740
I'll come pick you up.

364
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,480
They're pretty huge dinosaurs.

365
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,580
Please make a big boat when you come pick me up.

366
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,420
Understood.

367
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,520
I'll be waiting in the north!

368
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
That idiot, he doesn't believe me at all.

369
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,780
Alright, I'll catch anything and anything.

370
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,520
Hey, Honda!

371
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,140
I'm here to have a beach date with a Paskin gal and a Koora star.

372
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,480
Idiot! We're not here to go sightseeing!

373
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,100
We're here to catch dinosaurs!

374
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,040
Let's go!

375
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,800
Yes.

376
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,380
You're starting to get a little weird.

377
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,560
Well, how's that?

378
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,360
You're starting to get the hang of it, aren't you?

379
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,220
Huh?

380
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,000
What's with that crowd?

381
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,840
Oh, I don't think the dinosaurs have been caught by now.

382
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,520
We can't go in from here on.

383
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,240
What are they?

384
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,280
They're the inhabitants of this island.

385
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,600
Oh, you're Japanese?

386
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,280
Mitsurin is a sacred place on this island, so humans are in the way.

387
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,780
What?

388
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,360
I'm not kidding.

389
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,280
We're here to catch dinosaurs from Japan.

390
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
We'll let you in and catch anything and anything.

391
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,220
Hey, senpai.

392
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,220
Wait!

393
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,560
Shut up!

394
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,860
Let go of me, you-

395
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,780
What are you doing?

396
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,480
Let go of me!

397
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,500
What are you doing?

398
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,600
Let go of me!

399
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,140
Let go of me!

400
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,880
Senpai!

401
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
What's that?

402
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,940
Is this sound a dinosaur?

403
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,080
It's the sound of our queen!

404
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,040
It's the sound of our queen!

405
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,200
It's the sound of our queen!

406
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,740
Open the door!

407
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,320
Open the door!

408
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:19,880
Open the door!

409
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,840
What?

410
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,880
What the hell is that?

411
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,720
Listen carefully and remember!

412
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,480
I am the master of this island, Princess Onoroke.

413
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,560
Princess Onoroke?

414
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,620
Princess Onoroke?

415
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,540
You mean the relative of Princess Mononoke?

416
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,080
Whoever goes into this cave will surely get the wrath of the guardian god of this island.

417
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,940
They must not go in!

418
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,700
The guardian god?

419
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm Nusshi, the surprise prank.

420
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,940
What?

421
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,340
Nusshi?

422
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,700
Nusshi?

423
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,140
If you're going to say it, you should say it from the beginning.

424
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,960
So, what is that Nusshi?

425
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,400
What are we looking for?

426
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,420
I think this nell is the mysterious dragon!

427
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,120
You think so?

428
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,960
Then there is this dragon!

429
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,560
Right, more and more fights are starting now!

430
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Are you not listening to me?

431
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,080
Anyone from this island has finally entered this dungeon and returned safely.

432
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,440
Stop looking for dinosaurs and enjoy your vacation on this island!

433
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,700
Princess Onoroke Sisters!

434
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:24,760
What?

435
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,660
Princess Onoroke!

436
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,120
Princess Onoroke!

437
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,860
Queen Onoroke!

438
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,880
Wow!

439
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Let's enjoy our island life more than dinosaurs!

440
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,560
We are working for the hotel "Amazing Fruits".

441
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,340
Please come to stay with us!

442
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,320
Everyone, let's dance together!

443
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,340
Wow!

444
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,420
Hey, hey, hey!

445
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,660
What are you doing? You're stretching under the flowers.

446
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,700
You can't do that.

447
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,460
Let's find dinosaurs by ourselves!

448
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,560
Let's go!

449
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,520
Disgusting, Branders!

450
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,880
"Amazing Fruits".

451
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,200
How about "Dinosaur Dumplings and Dinosaur Sambal"?

452
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,460
The winners will get the chance to see the most beautiful sunset in the world.

453
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,300
I want to go!

454
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,500
You want to get my sambal?

455
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,300
Yes!

456
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,380
I want to get your "Dinosaur Dumplings".

457
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,220
Hey, don't you have any more?

458
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,820
Thank you.

459
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,580
What are they doing here?

460
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,220
Everyone, it's showtime!

461
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,440
Ah! That's "Digital Digger"!

462
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,040
Hey, "Digital Digger"!

463
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,740
Oh, it's Ryozu.

464
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,580
Long time no see.

465
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
What are you doing here?

466
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm on a vacation with the special police officers, the Dolphins and Moon Diggers.

467
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,340
I'm free, so I'm here with the Onoroke Brothers.

468
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
I knew they would come.

469
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,060
And why are you here?

470
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,220
I'm looking for dinosaurs, of course!

471
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,600
Unlike the free people on vacation, I'm busy.

472
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,180
Let's go, Honda!

473
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,080
Yes, sir.

474
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,440
See you!

475
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,960
Wait, Ryozu.

476
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,380
What?

477
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,240
I found something here.

478
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,060
Hey, hey, hey!

479
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,660
Take this.

480
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,520
What is this?

481
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,520
It's a shell.

482
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,860
Blow it when something happens.

483
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,940
It'll come running to you.

484
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
No, no, I...

485
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,700
Don't hold back.

486
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm not holding back!

487
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,640
See you later.

488
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,620
Hey, everyone, sorry to keep you waiting.

489
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,000
Say that again!

490
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,500
Damn it! Who's blowing this?

491
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,760
Oh, hey, hey!

492
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,920
Senpai, I don't know what's going on with the dinosaurs.

493
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,860
Shouldn't we have them?

494
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,500
Then you should have them!

495
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,640
Let's go!

496
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,100
Yes, sir.

497
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,160
Hey, princess!

498
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,700
We don't have money to play, so I'll help you find the dinosaurs!

499
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,140
Hey! Wait!

500
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,140
Owner!

501
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,980
Princess Onoroke...

502
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,560
Whatever.

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,720
If she finds out the horror of the jungle,

504
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,140
she'll wake up and come back right away.

505
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,460
Senpai, I'm starting to get scared of you.

506
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,820
What are you talking about?

507
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,080
You're a man, so you're pathetic.

508
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,220
Let's go back!

509
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,580
Let go of me!

510
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,280
You're a hopeless person.

511
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,560
But I'm hungry.

512
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,020
What's that?

513
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,120
It smells like food.

514
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,500
It's true.

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,200
It's over there.

516
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,660
It's food!

517
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,260
Look, Honda!

518
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,060
What's that?

519
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,540
I'm sure there's a party in this jungle

520
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,780
looking for dinosaurs other than us.

521
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,940
What?

522
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,620
That party was partying here.

523
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm sure this is that thing.

524
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,600
You're talking nonsense.

525
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,740
Senpai, this is too unnatural.

526
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,900
What?

527
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,700
This is usually called a trap.

528
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,020
A trap?

529
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,480
That's right.

530
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,460
You idiot!

531
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,660
Why didn't you tell me it was a trap?

532
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,180
If you thought it was a trap,

533
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,640
why didn't you tell me sooner?

534
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,060
I'm sorry.

535
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,100
Senpai, that's...

536
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,200
Huh?

537
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,140
Hey!

538
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,060
You guys got caught in a trap, too?

539
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,980
Damn it.

540
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,860
Who the hell is this guy doing this?

541
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,780
It's foolish to get caught in such a simple trap.

542
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:39,780
Huh?

543
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,080
You're the real Dad, aren't you?

544
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
You're Ryochi Kankichi?

545
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,440
You didn't come here to look for dinosaurs, did you?

546
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,720
That's right.

547
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,600
I'm going to use my Hon-dara-genpo as a bait to catch dinosaurs.

548
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
You have the same mentality as Senpai.

549
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,460
Shut up!

550
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,160
Hey, Hon-dara-daddy!

551
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,280
A dinosaur can't learn such a vulgar-genpo.

552
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
If you can't do it,

553
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,340
you'll have to pay a fine and make a profit.

554
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,020
See? It's the same.

555
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,640
Hey, you!

556
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,260
I'm going to catch the dinosaurs!

557
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,400
You're the one who's the one who's going to catch the dinosaurs!

558
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,180
You're the one who's going to catch the dinosaurs!

559
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,280
Shut up!

560
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,440
It's useless! It's useless!

561
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,300
Those knifes won't be able to cut iron!

562
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,780
We'll take care of the dinosaurs!

563
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,900
Let's go!

564
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,140
Okay!

565
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,220
Hey, hurry up!

566
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,480
Look at Hon-dara-daddy now!

567
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,920
It looks like he's having a hard time.

568
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,300
Well?

569
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,980
Shall we help him?

570
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,240
Hey! Come on!

571
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,580
It costs 50,000 yen a person.

572
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,420
What?!

573
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,640
What? 50,000 yen?

574
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,720
Please pay the cash first.

575
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,600
Don't joke around! Don't get involved in business if you're weak!

576
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,960
-Hey! I'll pay for it, so help me! -What?

577
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,740
Here! Since there are 4 of us, it'll be 200,000 yen!

578
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,940
-There's no other way. -Yes, for me.

579
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,420
Princess Onoroke, 200,000 yen has been added!

580
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,960
Okay, cut it up.

581
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,920
Yes!

582
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,540
-Please pay for this, too! -We'll pay for it, too!

583
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,840
Smile!

584
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,040
Go! Go!

585
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,040
Senpai, we don't have 100,000 yen, so are we going to stay like this forever?

586
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,640
If we do, we'll escape without a trace!

587
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,900
Honda, get the backpack over here!

588
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,280
-What? -Like this?

589
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:40,920
Yes.

590
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,420
-Okay. -Okay.

591
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,720
-Okay. -Okay.

592
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,860
What are you assembling?

593
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,420
The Takahida Kiryu I bought at the market the other day.

594
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,580
-It's a red-leafed cutting scissors. -A red-leafed cutting scissors.

595
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,300
Okay, I'm done.

596
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,600
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

597
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,480
With this, you can buy a high-priced branch.

598
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,480
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

599
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:57,960
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

600
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,760
Hey, how's it going?

601
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,340
The money you pay is worth nothing.

602
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,780
-Let's go, Honda! -Yes!

603
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,440
He's pretty good, that gorilla guy.

604
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,560
Honda! Don't let Mr. Hondara get ahead of you!

605
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,440
Yes!

606
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,380
Mr. Hondara, I'll pay you back for this!

607
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,080
I'll make sure you pay me back!

608
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,140
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

609
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,520
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

610
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,680
I found it!

611
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,160
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

612
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,340
This footprint is similar to Tyrannosaurus.

613
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,240
I wonder if there's a dinosaur after all.

614
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,780
I'm sure the tree was knocked down.

615
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,740
Honda! Don't let Mr. Hondara get ahead of you!

616
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,260
Yes!

617
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,320
"A Red-leafed Cutting Scissors"

618
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,320
Ah!

619
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,600
You're gonna get in trouble, Senpai!

620
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,860
Damn, you crossed a river, huh.

621
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,000
Senpai, what's that?

622
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,040
Hey, give me a hand.

623
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,340
Hey, Mr. Hondara!

624
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,500
Ryozu, you're out of here already?

625
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,740
I'll repay you for everything you did!

626
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,400
Let's go!

627
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,880
No!

628
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,520
Not at all!

629
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,300
Go!

630
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,780
"Ryokutsu Kankitsu"

631
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,840
"Ryokutsu Kankitsu"

632
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,260
"Ryokutsu Kankitsu"

633
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,720
Are you alright, Senpai?

634
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,120
That bastard!

635
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,460
Give up and go home!

636
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,520
Shut up!

637
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,160
I won't give up at this rate!

638
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,900
I have a trump card!

639
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,640
A trump card?

640
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:42,960
Where did you get that?

641
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,780
From you!

642
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,780
Me?

643
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,060
That's not it!

644
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,520
That's it!

645
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,660
That's it! Grab the stick!

646
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,020
That's not it!

647
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,620
This feeling is...

648
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,620
Alright!

649
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,480
That's it!

650
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,500
You're holding on tight!

651
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,180
Let's go!

652
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,880
Go!

653
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:12,780
Go!

654
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,420
You're all useless!

655
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,060
Speed up!

656
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,760
Sh-Shiga!

657
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,680
They're coming at a tremendous speed!

658
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,980
I won't let you!

659
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,460
Wanihameha!

660
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,440
Wanihameha!

661
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,180
What kind of special move is that?

662
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,760
What kind of special move is that?

663
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:38,940
What kind of special move is that?

664
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,760
What kind of special move is that?

665
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,980
Did you see that, Wanihameha, the sword of the Hon-Dara?

666
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,440
Did you see that, Wanihameha, the sword of the Hon-Dara?

667
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,280
What?

668
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,360
You're all useless!

669
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
What kind of special move is that?

670
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,980
I just threw a stone!

671
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,780
Senpai, you shouldn't say that.

672
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,320
What?

673
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,280
What?

674
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,260
This is the end, Ryotsukan!

675
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,200
Goodbye!

676
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,200
Senpai!

677
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,720
Damn it! Is there anything I can do?

678
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,780
Oh, yes.

679
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,460
What is it?

680
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,980
This is the thing!

681
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,780
A song about...

682
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:27,060
An unknown sea...

683
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,820
Senpai, what about this song?

684
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,180
He's here!

685
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,920
He's here!

686
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,080
I love the sea and protect justice.

687
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,280
Who read this?

688
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,200
Poseidon.

689
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,740
I'll put it in a tank.

690
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,520
I'll put it in a tank.

691
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,680
I'm the captain of the Marine Corps,

692
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,520
the sea's Do-dai-moon.

693
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
The boring Yashio Hikato is the trademark.

694
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,040
Dolby Moon!

695
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,740
It's a long factory as always.

696
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,280
Ryotsu, I'm tired of this, so it's all right.

697
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,040
You're showing off your art, Biker!

698
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,620
Well, I've been doing this lately,

699
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,860
and my subordinates don't listen to me.

700
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,680
That's enough, so help me.

701
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,320
Help me!

702
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,360
Oh.

703
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,260
Hahaha!

704
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Whoa!

705
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Whoa!

706
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Whoa!

707
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,140
Whoa!

708
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,060
Whoa!

709
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Whoa!

710
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,740
Whoa!

711
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:44,960
Whoa!

712
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,020
Whoa!

713
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,580
I'm going to die!

714
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,720
Hey, that's too rough!

715
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,360
I was able to help you.

716
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,200
Don't complain like that.

717
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,680
I've heard you're the best in the world.

718
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,100
Then, have a nice day!

719
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,020
Have a nice day!

720
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,180
Have a nice day!

721
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,260
Have a nice day!

722
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,160
Anyway, I was able to save you.

723
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,840
Honda, I'm going to follow your father!

724
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,960
Well, let's go home.

725
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,420
Idiot!

726
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,860
You can't come this far and quit.

727
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,340
Let's go!

728
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,400
I understand.

729
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm here.

730
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,980
I'm here.

731
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,520
Hmm?

732
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh?

733
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:26,880
What's this?

734
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,860
What's that sound?

735
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,380
It might be the sound of the dinosaurs' footsteps!

736
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,940
Right?

737
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,620
That's right!

738
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,020
It's definitely this way!

739
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:38,840
Let's go!

740
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,580
Oh, no...

741
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,860
Senpai, the desert...

742
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,920
What's going on on this island?

743
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,620
But the footsteps of the dinosaurs

744
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,360
are certainly going to the other side of the slope.

745
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,880
What's that sound like?

746
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,860
It's definitely the sound of the dinosaurs' footsteps.

747
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,800
It's definitely the sound of the dinosaurs' footsteps.

748
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:02,860
It's definitely the sound of the dinosaurs' footsteps.

749
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,600
Wasn't it prepared for the desert forest?

750
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,840
Wasn't it prepared for the desert forest?

751
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,540
If it's like that,

752
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,080
I'll be even more late!

753
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,900
Let's go, Honda!

754
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,380
What are you doing? Come on!

755
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,020
Yes, yes...

756
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,100
I can't stand the heat.

757
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,640
Damn it!

758
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,140
My body!

759
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,360
Hey!

760
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,020
Honda,

761
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,260
give me some water.

762
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,960
Senpai, give me some water.

763
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,380
What's going on?

764
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,020
Senpai, let's go back to Japan.

765
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,440
I can't go back by myself.

766
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,800
If we cross this slope,

767
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,240
there might be water.

768
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,520
Let's go!

769
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,180
Honda!

770
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,660
I'm the disciple of Hon-Dara-Oyaji!

771
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,140
It's Hon-Dara-Oyaji!

772
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,800
He's also a toho.

773
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,240
Alright, Honda,

774
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,640
let's catch up with him!

775
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,100
Huh?

776
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,820
Hey, Honda, what's wrong?

777
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,440
I can't walk even a step.

778
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,020
Hey, be strong!

779
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,240
Just a little more!

780
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,180
Hey!

781
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,200
Hon-Dara-Oyaji!

782
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,620
You're so strong!

783
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,660
You're so strong!

784
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,500
I'll catch you!

785
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,320
I won't lose!

786
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,340
You're so annoying!

787
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,940
You're a pervert gorilla!

788
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,020
You're so smart!

789
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,120
You're a perverted pervert!

790
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,660
I can't stand it anymore...

791
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,880
I can't stand it anymore...

792
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,020
I can't stand it anymore...

793
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,860
What?

794
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,700
I can't stand it anymore...

795
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,420
You again!

796
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,700
You seem to be tired.

797
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,980
There are mineral water, cola, juice, oolong tea,

798
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,900
and anything in my Oroki oasis.

799
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,140
There are mineral water, cola, juice, oolong tea,

800
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,020
Have a drink!

801
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,460
I'll drink!

802
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,240
I'll drink!

803
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,320
I'll drink!

804
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,800
What are you doing?

805
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,920
What are you doing?

806
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
It's 10,000 yen per cup.

807
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,460
It's 10,000 yen per cup.

808
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,820
10,000 yen?

809
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,580
Are you trying to trick me?

810
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,640
10,000 yen per cup.

811
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,440
Take it, thief!

812
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,460
Don't pay!

813
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,860
Don't pay!

814
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,140
Thank you.

815
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,260
Thank you.

816
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,520
Here you are.

817
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,680
Thank you.

818
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,100
Thank you.

819
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,640
I'm alive!

820
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,920
Look at this dangerous man!

821
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm alive!

822
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm alive!

823
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,180
I'm alive!

824
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,120
I'll drink it even if I have to.

825
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,120
I'll drink it even if I have to.

826
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,080
I'll drink it even if I have to.

827
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,480
Damn it!

828
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,220
It's dirty.

829
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,560
Honda!

830
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,100
Oh, I see.

831
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,960
There's a

832
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,820
There's a

833
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,240
There's a

834
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,320
There's a

835
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,120
There's a

836
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,040
Someone, bring it on!

837
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,620
Someone, bring it on!

838
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,680
Someone, bring it on!

839
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:35,700
Please!

840
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,620
Someone, bring it on!

841
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,460
Stop it!

842
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,160
I don't have that power!

843
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,920
Huh?

844
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,960
That's...

845
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,220
That's...

846
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,060
That's...

847
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:58,780
"The Great Barbecue"

848
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,600
It's not just about the barbecued fish.

849
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,100
When an incident happens on the land,

850
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,060
you can solve it with a single barbeque.

851
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,260
The Great Barbecue, Haraiwa, is here!

852
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,440
You came back well, the Great Barbecue!

853
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,480
What's wrong? What's the matter, Ryo-tsu?

854
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,360
As you can see, my throat is dry.

855
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,720
My stomach is dry.

856
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,400
I think Honda and I are going to die.

857
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,880
Help me!

858
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,400
The barbecued fish I made was useful.

859
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,760
All right.

860
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,680
Here.

861
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,560
Why can you make ramen from a place like that?

862
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,220
Don't worry about the details.

863
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,700
Now, eat.

864
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,180
It's a special seafood ramen made by Kaipan.

865
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,540
I wish it was a cold Chinese ramen.

866
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,600
Hot!

867
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,300
Hot, hot, hot!

868
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,840
It didn't suit your taste.

869
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,860
I see.

870
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,240
I've been studying the best ramen lately.

871
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,820
Don't eat the best ramen at a time like this!

872
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,560
Give me some water. Water!

873
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,820
You have a lot of orders.

874
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,360
Well, then...

875
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,940
Well, then...

876
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,160
Now, drink.

877
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,340
Drinking

878
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm not surprised what comes out of the bowl.

879
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,640
But even if you tell me to drink at the first place...

880
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,580
I told you not to worry about the details.

881
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,400
But...

882
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,180
Drinking

883
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,100
Now, drink.

884
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,040
Drinking

885
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,840
I'll eat it! I'll eat it!

886
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,480
Drinking

887
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,980
Drinking

888
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,080
I'll eat it!

889
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Drinking

890
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,640
Drinking

891
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:27,960
Drinking

892
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,620
Anyway, I'm saved.

893
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,880
Let me thank you, Kaipan.

894
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,860
Thank you.

895
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,200
If you have a problem, call me anytime.

896
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,520
Well then.

897
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,520
Farewell.

898
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,380
Drinking

899
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,620
Drinking

900
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,360
Senior, you really saved me.

901
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,100
Yeah.

902
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,820
He's a pervert, but he's a nice guy.

903
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,740
Yeah!

904
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,920
Let's find the owner once we get back.

905
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,760
Let's find the owner once we get back.

906
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:50,980
Yes!

907
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,660
The footprints are all over here.

908
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,600
Hmm... So you climbed up this cliff...

909
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,960
Hm?

910
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,540
Ah!

911
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:06,860
Huh?

912
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,860
Father Hondora!

913
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,100
Huh?

914
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,860
What's wrong?

915
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,380
You're so quiet!

916
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,940
Hey, you!

917
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,140
You're going to catch up, so get ready!

918
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,120
I won't let you!

919
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:16,880
Oh!

920
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,280
Honda, rope!

921
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:22,780
Yes!

922
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,120
I'm going to catch you!

923
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,080
I won't let you!

924
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,980
Hey!

925
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,600
Huh?

926
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,120
Oh!

927
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,920
You're caught!

928
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Let's go, Honda!

929
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:33,940
Yes!

930
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:45,660
You're such a stubborn guy!

931
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,220
Hey, what are you doing?

932
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,740
I'm going to fall!

933
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,040
You're going to die!

934
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,040
Stop!

935
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,340
You!

936
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,180
You're a loser!

937
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,180
You!

938
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,460
Ah!

939
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,940
Ah!

940
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,260
Ah!

941
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,260
Oh...

942
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,700
Oh, I'm saved.

943
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,340
What's this place?

944
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,100
A bird's nest?

945
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,800
Huh?

946
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,660
It's an egg.

947
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,420
Huh?

948
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,120
Okay.

949
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,380
I won't forgive you, Father Hondora!

950
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,560
Hey!

951
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

952
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,060
Oh!

953
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,700
This time, I won't let you go!

954
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,840
Ah!

955
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,860
Ah!

956
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,440
Ah!

957
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,740
Ah!

958
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,920
Oh, dear!

959
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,900
Ah!

960
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:25,780
Oh, dear!

961
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,000
Ah!

962
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,440
Ah!

963
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,100
Ah!

964
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,180
Oh, dear, I don't want to see you again!

965
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,340
Ah!

966
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,400
Ah!

967
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,020
Ah!

968
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,500
Oh, dear!

969
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:41,720
Ah!

970
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:41,860
Ow!

971
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:42,720
Ow!

972
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:42,920
Ouch!

973
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:42,940
Ouch!

974
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,240
Ouch!

975
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,320
Ouch!

976
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,340
Stop!

977
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:43,800
Eh?

978
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:45,680
Ah!

979
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,720
It hurts!

980
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,180
Okay!

981
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,060
Let go! Let go of me, you fool!

982
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,480
Now then...

983
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,220
Uangik, it's my turn.

984
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,560
That was close!

985
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Gasp!

986
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,380
Oh my.

987
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,140
Nice!

988
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,320
I can't believe you can self-destruct with your own sword.

989
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,800
Huh?

990
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,180
Man!

991
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,000
Thank you so much.

992
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,140
So where are you off to, mister?

993
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,080
Hey, cool guy?

994
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,840
-What? -It's Nus-C!

995
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,300
There's no mistake!

996
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,520
We finally caught up with Nus-C!

997
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,240
-Let's go! -Yes!

998
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,480
This music...

999
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,220
Long time no see, Ryotsu!

1000
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,160
So it's you, Captain Bugryu!

1001
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
Why are you here?

1002
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,720
I'm here to capture the dinosaurs by American policy.

1003
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm here to capture the dinosaurs by American policy.

1004
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,840
What? You must be joking!

1005
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,260
You've come all the way here to do this!

1006
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,620
No matter what happens, I won't let you have Nus-C!

1007
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,000
I can't help it.

1008
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,820
Then I'll take it with all my might.

1009
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,260
Stop, Bugryu!

1010
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,200
Give up and go home.

1011
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,020
No!

1012
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,060
No!

1013
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,600
Damn it!

1014
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,300
Honda, come here!

1015
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,260
Yes, sir.

1016
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,560
Yes, sir.

1017
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,640
I don't want to call you, but I'll call you the Specialist of the Sky!

1018
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,960
The moon's energy is in your back, and the sticks of justice are in the dark!

1019
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,260
If it's the case of the sky, I'll let you handle it!

1020
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,380
The Moon Giant is back!

1021
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,040
The same goes for Assistant Venus Giant!

1022
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,880
I'll take care of the rest!

1023
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,800
What's with them?

1024
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,700
They're in the way!

1025
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,560
Take this!

1026
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,320
They're useless!

1027
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,300
I'm going to die!

1028
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,460
Our moon is...

1029
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,700
It can't be helped.

1030
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,600
Transform, Big Venus!

1031
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,740
Yes, sir!

1032
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,780
Moonlight Power!

1033
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,700
Make up!

1034
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:39,440
Make up!

1035
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,740
Master Tetsumaru!

1036
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,880
By transforming the Moon Giant into a female mouse,

1037
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,500
he can run faster!

1038
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,460
He can run faster!

1039
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,540
He can run faster!

1040
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,060
He can run faster!

1041
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,760
Oh, he's gone.

1042
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,600
But even if a man dressed up as a female mouse,

1043
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,380
he's still just a mouse.

1044
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,860
He's just a mouse.

1045
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,120
Oh!

1046
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,280
No!

1047
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,140
I'm going to kill you!

1048
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,920
All right!

1049
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,180
I'll use the power of the Three-Sword Bear!

1050
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,100
Yes, sir!

1051
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,900
All right!

1052
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,880
We'll be dead before you know it.

1053
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,240
A forest is deep.

1054
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,880
I can see them.

1055
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,220
All right!

1056
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,200
All right!

1057
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,680
All right!

1058
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:28,840
All right!

1059
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,060
All right!

1060
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,520
All right!

1061
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,060
All right!

1062
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,080
All right!

1063
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,580
All right!

1064
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:31,860
What are you going to do?

1065
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,300
I'll make Captain Bugryu blow it up.

1066
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,080
Alright.

1067
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,200
Honda!

1068
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,880
Pull that rope as hard as you can!

1069
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,340
Alright, stop!

1070
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,700
Listen, Honda.

1071
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,260
When Captain's Apache comes back, release that rope!

1072
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,640
Now!

1073
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,600
Captain Bugryu!

1074
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,100
Captain Bugryu!

1075
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,980
Prepare yourself!

1076
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,280
What?

1077
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,700
Idiot!

1078
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,000
I cut another boring thing.

1079
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,600
Sto...

1080
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm going to crash into Nusshi!

1081
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,000
Senpai, this is bad!

1082
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,580
Captain's helicopter, Nusshi, is going to crash!

1083
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:28,740
It's going to explode!

1084
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,900
What?

1085
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:39,060
It's still alive?

1086
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,820
Captain!

1087
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,100
Hey!

1088
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,700
You ruined my Apache!

1089
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,020
W... What is this?

1090
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,140
She got scared!

1091
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,220
Did Nusshi make this?

1092
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,380
Hey you, you!

1093
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,980
What's going on here?

1094
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,340
I... I'm sorry.

1095
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,880
There are lots of things happening here.

1096
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,220
Well? Explain yourself!

1097
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,480
No! That's all.

1098
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,380
Oh, my God!

1099
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,800
What?

1100
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,960
A " vibration? " What

1101
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,540
did you say? You

1102
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,040
see, this isn't a twilight fairy but a twilight witch! Hey!

1103
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,400
What is the meaning of this? There's

1104
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,260
been a real increase in potential visitors to the island recently. That's

1105
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,100
why we're going to get some show-offs, and get

1106
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,300
everybody to join our plan. What?

1107
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,020
We're

1108
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,240
not going to let you get away without us!

1109
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,360
Abo-chan!

1110
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,840
Damn it! They're so fast at running away!

1111
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,100
Hey, Captain! Let's go too!

1112
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,440
What are you going to do after letting my Apache fall?

1113
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:10,820
B!

1114
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,600
Farewell!

1115
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,940
Hey, you! Stop!

1116
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,220
We're gone...

1117
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,060
Senpai, what are we going to do?

1118
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,760
What are we going to do?

1119
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,660
I don't know. Let's have Nakagawa come pick us up.

1120
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,480
Ryo-chan, what are you going to do?

1121
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:29,520
Let's go!

1122
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,500
That's why I'm not going anywhere right now.

1123
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,460
You shouldn't come back here right now.

1124
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
How about staying over there until the fire goes out?

1125
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,620
I can't help it. I'll live here for a while.

1126
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,240
Damn you!

1127
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,700
Damn you!

1128
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,900
Senpai, that voice...

1129
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,280
It was in the air, right?

1130
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,340
Let's go!

1131
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,860
That was a really long flight.

1132
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,920
As expected, a real dinosaur doesn't survive in this world.

1133
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,820
Let's try it again next time.
