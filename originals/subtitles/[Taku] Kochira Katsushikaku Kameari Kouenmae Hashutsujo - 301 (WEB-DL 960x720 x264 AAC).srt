A Little Long Ago

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
The city of Kameari has changed a lot.

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,280
When I graduated from the police school and became a member of the police,

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,160
there was no public transportation yet.

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,040
There was a big cargo control room.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,860
There were a few factories.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,680
The population increased and the anti-corruption world was expanding.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,240
There were five cinemas.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,120
If I remember correctly, there was a tobacco shop on this corner.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,820
Oh, I see. Yoko-chan's tobacco shop is gone too.

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,200
Yoko-chan?

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,160
Yes.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,180
There was a tobacco shop here, and Yoko-chan was the sign girl.

30
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,680
I wonder how many years it's been.

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,420
Grandma!

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Hey, grandma!

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,280
Grandma!

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
Oh, it's you, Lusca.

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,860
I guess I can't help it.

36
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,780
I'm sure it's always around here.

37
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
Thief!

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,900
I'm not a thief!

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,060
I'm a police officer!

40
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm a thief!

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,880
You're a thief pretending to be a police officer!

42
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,220
No, I'm not!

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,420
I just came to buy tobacco!

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
What are you doing, Ryo-san?

45
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,920
Grandma!

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,660
Grandma?

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,360
Let go of me, Yoko.

48
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,400
You're making that face, but you're a real police officer.

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,880
A real one?

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm sorry, I was just...

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,440
I was sorry for trying to take the tobacco on my own.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,640
But I was thrown away.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:17,900
I get it now.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,100
No one thinks you're a police officer.

55
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm afraid that my head is in danger.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,940
Mom, did Yoko ever tell you what happened to Yoko?

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,840
She just told me.

58
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, oh!

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,340
Mottl!

60
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,780
Sasaki!

61
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,220
Yoko!

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,860
You've been standing on the platform...

63
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,120
All of you didn't guess he had aBT, did you?

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,100
...to the platform?

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,400
Don't move!

66
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,980
That was good.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,540
You two, get up.

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,960
I thought we would go to the Olympics.

69
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,940
But now, I'm just a woman in the mountains.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,680
That's right.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,300
Go, go, go!

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,180
Go!

73
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Give me back my baby!

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,480
What's wrong, Terai?

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,580
When did you have a baby?

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
It's not my baby.

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,400
Hey, wait!

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,420
More importantly, Ryo-san,

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,720
A rare person is coming.

80
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,700
Hey!

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
A rare person?

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,020
Hey, it's a guest.

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,280
Guest?

84
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,140
To Ryo-chan?

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,180
Ryo-san.

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,740
Hey!

87
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,100
Long time no see.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
It's Ryouko-chan.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,460
It's been a while.

90
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,820
What? Ryouko-chan?

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,960
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,560
I was just passing by the tobacco shop and I heard a rumor.

93
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,220
It's completely changed.

94
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,500
What's wrong?

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,800
What?

96
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,740
Nothing.

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,300
I don't want to see the Kameari town for the first time in a long time.

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,460
I don't want to see the Kameari town for the first time in a long time.

99
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,740
You don't want to see the Kameari town for the first time in a long time.

100
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,480
I see.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,420
Your husband was a reputable man in Kasumegaseki.

102
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,500
Are you doing well?

103
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,080
Yeah...

104
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,100
What?

105
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,700
Perhaps, what's that now…

106
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah.

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,880
He is a twin.

108
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,960
He is four,

109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,140
but he's already playing tricks.

110
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,500
Is that so?

111
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,300
What's your name?

112
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
Koji on my name.

113
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Together, they are called Koji Ken.

114
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,180
It's Koji on Kenji.

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,500
That's nice.

116
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,720
I haven't seen you in a long time.

117
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,100
Hey, Nagagawa, Reiko,

118
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,640
Let's talk about when you were in high school, Ryoko-chan.

119
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,960
No, Ryo-san.

120
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,480
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

121
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,780
Back then, the office had me, the manager, and the old man.

122
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,580
Ah, Totsuka was there too.

123
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,600
What? Is that true, Totsuka?

124
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,840
Yeah, it's true. I saw it with my own eyes.

125
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,140
That tobacco shop's Ryoko-chan fell in love with him.

126
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,120
Haha, it's spring.

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,900
Here he comes. It's him.

128
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,180
He's the senior of the literature club.

129
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,740
There's not much connection between the literature club and judo club.

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,700
Yeah, that's why he hasn't even spoken to them yet.

131
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,680
He's always just staring at them until they pass by.

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
It's hard to say.

133
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,440
Yeah, let's have a date somehow.

134
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah, let's have a date somehow.

135
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,860
N-no, I just got here.

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,500
You're not even close to being a regular.

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
You're the gym guy, aren't you.

138
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,220
Don't you think the guilt that Raskolnikov has borne

139
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,020
will be applied to us high school students?

140
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,080
Y-yes.

141
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,680
What's going on?

142
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,980
I don't really get it.

143
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,960
Well, this is the first date.

144
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,220
Well, this is the first date.

145
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,320
That pretty girl is...

146
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,660
Kirimanjaro Yuki.

147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,220
Eh?

148
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,500
Akkyu Shoden.

149
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,180
Oh.

150
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,460
I wonder why.

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,540
I feel a little sick.

152
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,140
That's about a different world.

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,940
W-what's wrong?

154
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Ah...

155
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,700
That's...

156
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:11,080
A-a-a...

157
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,420
Is it an opportunity to tie her up or something?

158
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,240
Yes. Yes.

159
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
Ah-ah-ah!

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Help, Mama!

161
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,600
Ah-ah-ah!

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,540
Help, Mama, huh!

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,160
Help, Mama, huh!

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,540
Is that where Mama is?

165
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:21,580
You're the one who's the one who's the one to blame, huh?

166
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,420
You're the one who's the one to blame, huh?

167
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,780
He-he-he-he-heh.

168
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,520
He-he-he-he-heh.

169
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,060
He-he-he-heh.

170
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, Mama, you're going to have to go out with us.

171
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,240
He-he-he-heh.

172
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,520
Hey!

173
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,180
You're putting her in the wrong place!

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,180
You're putting her in the wrong place!

175
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,820
I'm going to go get her!

176
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,440
Totsuka!

177
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,360
Leave it to me!

178
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,280
Ryo! Totsuka!

179
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,140
I'll be on your side, Yoko!

180
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:04,600
You did it, Mama! Now there's no more bad guys around!

181
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,940
I'm sure there are no more bad guys around!

182
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,140
I'm sure there are no more bad guys around!

183
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm sure there are no more bad guys around!

184
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,660
Mother-Kon?

185
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,700
I don't know about that!

186
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,580
I now understand why only smart people can't do it.

187
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,000
That's true.

188
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,000
After that, the guy gave Yoko a massage,

189
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
and she kept chasing him around.

190
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,700
It's so frustrating.

191
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,380
If you're going to wait, then wait!

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,220
Don't write a prank on the handbook!

193
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,240
Give it back to me!

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,660
Geez, I won't listen no matter how much I say it.

195
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,500
Hey, Kenji! Koji!

196
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,460
Ha ha, it's no use scolding him.

197
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,980
He's so old now, he's always playing pranks.

198
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,640
Ah!

199
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,040
Geez!

200
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,480
Hey, Terai! Where's the key to the handbook?

201
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,780
That was also taken by the two of them.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,580
What?

203
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,780
Oh, right.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
You all went to the beach, didn't you?

205
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,380
On a trip to the Chounai Sea.

206
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeah, to the Chiba Sea.

207
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,060
Then, you two,

208
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,900
make sure you don't get any bad bugs on your first-born granddaughter.

209
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,160
And take good care of her.

210
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,500
It's okay, I'm not worried.

211
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,180
I'm counting on you, Yoko.

212
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,740
We both have work to do.

213
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,780
Please.

214
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Oh, yeah! Leave it to us!

215
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,040
We can't let any of us stay in our house!

216
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,100
I'm off.

217
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,500
"A

218
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,980
It seems like everyone's scared.

219
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,220
It's okay, it's okay.

220
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,420
We're trying not to let Yoko-chan get any bugs on her.

221
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,700
Since we're entrusted with this, we have a responsibility.

222
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,520
This is fun!

223
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,380
Right, Ryo-san?

224
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,260
I knew it. This is what you call the sea.

225
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,080
Ryo-tsu, the waves are coming this far!

226
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,700
That's enough!

227
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,340
Oh, it's a beauty contest.

228
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,540
Yoko-chan, you should try it.

229
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Eh? I don't think...

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,600
It's okay.

231
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,380
If we cheer for her, she'll win!

232
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:02,580
Next up is the entry.

233
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,620
Entry No. 25, Yoko-chan from Katsushika prefecture!

234
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,940
Huh?

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,200
I've been waiting for you, Yoko-chan!

236
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,420
The tobacco shop princess!

237
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah!

238
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,240
Why aren't you wearing your bikini?

239
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,940
Take it off!

240
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,240
Hey, hey, take it off!

241
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,580
Show me your boobs!

242
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,220
Show me your boobs!

243
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,640
Ryo-tsu, you're not going to do it?

244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,840
Please don't take that cheap yaji.

245
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,460
Shut up!

246
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,940
I don't need a man!

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,860
I'm going to pull it out!

248
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,520
Who are you?

249
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
What are you doing?

250
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,420
Quiet!

251
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,380
Don't throw dirty yajis!

252
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,560
What?

253
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,940
Where did you come from?

254
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,220
I was in the B class in junior high school.

255
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm in the C class.

256
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,100
You bastard.

257
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll beat you up!

258
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,180
Hey, I won't give in!

259
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm a sea net cleaner.

260
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,340
Ah, it always turns out like this.

261
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,300
Hey, don't get it wrong!

262
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,680
We're policemen!

263
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,720
Don't lie!

264
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,740
Where are policemen like you?

265
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm not lying!

266
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:27,920
Don't say that!

267
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
I got it, I got it.

268
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,740
Listen to me!

269
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,760
If you're a officer!

270
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,860
You haven't changed at all since then.

271
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,000
You're right, you're like a senior.

272
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,160
Okay, I got it.

273
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,160
You took a long time.

274
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,040
Shut up, this wire is dangerous.

275
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,860
It can't be in my hand.

276
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,940
I'm sorry, I'm really not good at this.

277
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,680
You're right, you're like your mom, not your dad.

278
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,780
That's right.

279
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,640
I don't want you to look like me,

280
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,580
and I want you to look like me in many different ways.

281
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,120
Takashi-san, you should spend some more time with your child.

282
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,920
By the way,

283
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,140
I've been thinking about

284
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,940
what you're going to say about the new Tetsu-san.

285
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,520
Senpai and Totsuka-san are the only ones I talk about,

286
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,320
and Terae-san hasn't appeared at all.

287
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,280
That's true.

288
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,120
Hey, Ryo-chan, do you have anything to say about Terae-san and Yoko-san?

289
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,960
No, there's nothing like that.

290
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,380
You have that?

291
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,220
The most important episode about Terae-san?

292
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,840
No, Ryo-san, don't talk about that.

293
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,460
What, what, Ryo-chan?

294
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,200
I'd like to hear it.

295
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,220
What about Terae-san?

296
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,720
Actually,

297
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,060
if it's no good,

298
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,900
It's fine, it's just a matter of time.

299
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,220
I'm not going to talk about it.

300
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,060
Welcome.

301
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,960
Can I have a cigarette?

302
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,680
Just one.

303
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,540
Yes, the usual.

304
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,100
Yes, the usual.

305
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,540
Thank you.

306
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,860
As expected of the super electromagnetic robot.

307
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,080
It's a powerful magnet.

308
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,180
Ryo-chan.

309
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,040
What about Terae?

310
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
If it's Terae,

311
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,020
I went to buy a cigarette.

312
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
A cigarette?

313
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,660
That's strange.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,180
You don't smoke, do you?

315
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,040
I don't smoke, but I went to buy one.

316
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,660
It's the fifth time today.

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,700
Fifth time?

318
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,780
Oh, Terae.

319
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,320
It's about the documents I left here.

320
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh.

321
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,820
Oh!

322
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
Terae.

323
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,180
Terae-san,

324
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,520
I am Terae-san.

325
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,560
I'm going to smoke a cigarette.

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,280
It was the first time.

327
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,400
Terae-san,

328
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,440
Terai-san,

329
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,380
did you come to the part-time job you wanted?

330
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,340
Wasn't it?

331
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,280
I was going to do it the last time.

332
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,000
I was about to do it the last time.

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,220
What's important is,

334
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,220
Kashimi's day off was an accident.

335
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,760
I realized that.

336
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:16,780
What happens?

337
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,260
What do you mean?

338
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,800
What's the point?

339
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,520
If you keep it up,

340
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,760
it's no good.

341
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,300
What do you mean?

342
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,460
and have a happy family life.

343
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,860
It's a quick thing to do.

344
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,600
Oh, right, Yoko-chan.

345
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,260
Do you remember the wedding?

346
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,320
Yes.

347
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,360
"Yoko's Wedding"

348
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,360
Oh, Yoko. What's up?

349
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,720
Grandma, I've been taking care of you since you were a little girl.

350
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,800
What's with the sudden greeting?

351
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,900
It's not good for your health to be greeted with such a stupid greeting.

352
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,820
That's right.

353
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,720
I wanted to do it once.

354
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,400
Something like a TV drama.

355
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,960
There were many people who wanted to get a man like you to be married.

357
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,060
A man like you is like a grandmother.

358
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,720
Your father and mother are quiet.

359
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,660
I was also told that I was gentle and good at smoking.

360
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,740
What?

361
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,780
No way.

362
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,640
I can't believe it.

363
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,940
What is this?

364
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,420
What is the daughter going to marry?

365
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,280
How do you hear that quiet mouth?

366
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,100
It's okay.

367
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,420
It's love and love with Takashi-san.

368
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
If you say that,

369
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,400
That's a big family.

370
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,740
The neighbors are different from the suburb.

371
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,080
It's a mountainous woman.

372
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,520
I see.

373
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,700
That's right.

374
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,460
I don't want to be a pain in the ass.

375
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,220
I'll stop getting married.

376
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,720
Say that again.

377
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,480
It's a lie.

378
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,700
I'm not lying.

379
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,840
I'll go to the wedding and do it well.

380
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't worry about it.

381
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,780
Really?

382
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah.

383
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,720
I can't believe I can see Yoko's bridegroom figure.

384
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,320
There is nothing left in this world.

385
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,480
You.

386
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,940
Kiss with Princess

387
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,040
Grandma, you know where we are?

388
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,960
It's the princess hotel with the turtle.

389
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,840
I know.

390
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,580
I'll be going later.

391
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,860
We are both Doppler-ians, but we're different.

392
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
He's safe, and we're better than the others.

393
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,800
Y- you look so pretty.

394
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,860
Oh, well, my gums are actually quite puffy.

395
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,500
Here, it's done.

396
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Hmm? That looks good.

397
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,380
Now then...

398
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,580
*crying*

399
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,060
Kouharu-san? Kouharu-san? Kouharu-san? Kouharu-san?

400
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
Yes, Sasaki speaking.

401
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,220
What did you say?

402
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
Is that true, father?

403
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,980
Yes. I got a call from the neighbor, Miyake-san.

404
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,820
Grandma...

405
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,580
I was so surprised. I was looking forward to seeing you as a bride.

406
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,240
Father...

407
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,160
Oh, you're here.

408
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,620
I'll make sure you don't steal my love.

409
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,920
Yoko-chan.

410
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,640
Ryo-san.

411
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,340
What's wrong? Did something happen?

412
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Grandma...

413
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,800
Grandma...

414
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,640
Grandma is at the hospital.

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,640
What?

416
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,160
I wanted to show her my wedding dress, but...

417
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,420
Let's go!

418
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,100
Huh?

419
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,580
Move, move, move, move!

420
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,420
Hey, move!

421
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,940
Here, take this.

422
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,220
Here you go.

423
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,040
Hurry up!

424
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,120
Ryo-san.

425
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,060
Don't be nervous! I'm going to show Grandma my wedding dress!

426
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,740
Okay.

427
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,700
Take this.

428
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
Having sixty boca...

429
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,220
Keep yourани ready.

430
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,320
Okay.

431
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:15,740
Ouch!

432
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,600
Ow!

433
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,920
Ow!

434
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,200
Ow!

435
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,760
Ow!

436
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,400
Ow!

437
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,220
Ow!

438
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,940
Ow!

439
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,680
Ow!

440
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,700
Ow!

441
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,220
Heave off!

442
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,900
Ow!

443
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,160
Go away!

444
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,380
It's at your mercy!

445
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,400
Get out!

446
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,460
"Screw you!"

447
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,580
"You cannot touch me anymore, old man!"

448
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,780
"Old man!"

449
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,840
"Grandma!"

450
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,620
"M- you're late, but...

451
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,960
Grandma!

452
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,180
Grandma! Stay still!

453
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,100
Open your eyes! It's Yoko!

454
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,360
Yoko came to see me!

455
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,480
She came to see the costume!

456
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,680
Yoko, look at her!

457
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,540
Don't die, Grandma!

458
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,160
Shut up, man.

459
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,040
What do you mean, "don't die"?

460
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,440
It's meaningless.

461
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Geez, can you die from the back of your head?

462
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,760
Can you die from the back of your head?

463
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,860
Huh? Back of my head?

464
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,100
What are you doing?

465
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,700
Is it your wedding?

466
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,420
Did Hanamiko run away?

467
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,360
No, no, no.

468
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,140
Don't worry.

469
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,060
I wanted to show this to you, Grandma.

470
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,880
So...

471
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,840
Yoko.

472
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm going to take you to the wedding.

473
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,840
It's a beautiful bride.

474
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,820
Yoko, I know you very well.

475
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,160
You chose her.

476
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,420
She is the best bride in the world.

477
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you understand?

478
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,680
You can't leave her no matter what.

479
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,040
Yes.

480
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,380
Go back! Hanamiko is waiting for you!

481
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,100
Yes! Ryo, please come again!

482
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,380
Yes!

483
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,820
Yes!

484
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,520
Come on!

485
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,680
Did she fight with her husband?

486
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,800
Perhaps, what's the cause?

487
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,480
What's the reason?

488
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
No matter what it is.

489
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,000
Even if the city of the turtle changes, people's hearts do not change.

490
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,720
Those two should have returned to the feelings when they met.

491
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,620
Grandma is also happy because of the grass.

492
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm still alive.

493
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,400
It's a joke. Grandma is still healthy.

494
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,180
Of course.

495
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,460
But the tobacco shop will retire.

496
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,000
Retire? It's not a joke.

497
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,500
What do you think will happen here?

498
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,840
I am the owner.

499
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,520
The first floor is a tobacco shop.

500
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,400
I will not die until my daughter-in-law gets married.

501
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,020
We were invited to an event to run the Orient Express in Japan.

502
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,020
But in the room where we ran,

503
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,380
Mrs. Christie was running.

504
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,540
The

505
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:57,800
The

506
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,420
The

00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,440
The

508
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:58,500
The

509
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,560
The

510
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:58,660
The

511
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
The The

512
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,740
The The

513
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,340
The The

514
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,660
The The

515
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:02,680
The The

516
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:02,760
The The

517
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,280
The The

518
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,340
The The

519
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,360
The The

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,100

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,200
The

525
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,100
Kameari

526
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,740
There is Kameari

527
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,840
Ah, surely Kameari

528
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,640
Everyone come to our town

529
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,720
Thank you!
