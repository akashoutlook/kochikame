Hmm...

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,420
That's good.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
Cleaning done!

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,340
Let's go!

37
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,500
No!

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm going to polish the windows from the morning, so I'm going to do this!

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,140
Ryou-chan, it's dirty!

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,940
Ryou-san!

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,700
Hey! I'm not a dog!

42
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,640
It's really cold!

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,560
The chief Oohara warned me that there would be a lot of important guests coming today.

44
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,540
How about me?

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,460
I'm the chief of the police, so I don't care about important guests.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm sure the chief Oohara was worried that you would be a bother if you told Ryou-san.

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,860
The police chief will be here today, senpai.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,440
Police?

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
They will give you a list of the national police stations.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,600
The police chief will give you a list of national police stations.

51
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,860
The police chief will give you a list of national police stations.

52
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,500
Bye-bye!

53
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,060
It's called "Michelan" and it's like a ticket for the police station.

54
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,760
Ryou-chan, you've heard of it, right?

55
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,820
Hmm...

56
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,980
I've been in a police station for five years and I got a test for a missing person.

57
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,060
Hey!

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,600
I knew you'd come!

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,720
It's like a visit to school.

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Anyway,

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,620
If you're in the top three class, you'll get a gold medal and a good reputation as a model police station.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,360
A gold medal?

63
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,020
Bye-bye!

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,420
Anyway, the gold medal is a great honor for the chief Oohara.

65
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,860
We want to help you.

66
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,840
The police station is a safe and secure place for citizens.

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,780
It's a safe and secure place for citizens.

68
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,180
I think it's a strong shield.

69
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,420
And I want the inspectors to see the efforts of the people who share the same thoughts as you do every day.

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,180
I want the police station members all over the country to know about it.

71
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,000
I strongly, strongly...

72
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,700
The chief said that.

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,460
So Ryou-chan has to be especially good at business.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Don't make me a fool!

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm not a bad person.

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,880
I'll do it if I have to.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,440
So, is the chief still there?

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,040
He said he'd come out early today, but he's late.

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,560
Oh, welcome.

80
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,460
You're late, chief!

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

83
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,600
Huh?

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,980
No, Ryou-chan.

85
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,160
The preparations are in full swing, chief Oohara.

86
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,420
I see, Hiromi.

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,220
You're a young lady, aren't you, chief?

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,240
Ah, thank you for your hard work, Rei-ko-kun.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,740
Everyone helped me.

90
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,920
I see, I see.

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,740
It's a priest.

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh, it's a priest.

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,960
Chief?

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,840
Nakagawa.

95
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,880
It's Nakagawa.

96
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,480
Nakagawa, thank you for your hard work.

97
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm nervous now.

98
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,380
What are you going to do?

99
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,920
Please be strong, chief.

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
It's dark.

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,000
Chief!

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
Are you all right, chief?

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,760
Please be strong.

104
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,120
Ryou-chan and I are violent.

105
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,200
Then I'll be light.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,160
What?

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,760
I just fell for it a little.

108
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,000
I forgot that I had something important to tell everyone.

109
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,320
Something's on your face, Ryotsu.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,500
You didn't wash your face?

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,900
You're such a pain.

112
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,020
Hey, are your eyebrows connected?

113
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
No, they're not, chief.

114
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Chief, you look weird.

115
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,880
Yeah, pretty weird.

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,720
What happened?

117
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,280
Chief!

118
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,100
What happened?

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,440
Chief!

120
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,160
You're so hot, chief!

121
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,420
It's alright. I'll just keep working.

122
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
Chief, you should lie down.

123
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,100
Yeah.

124
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm really fine.

125
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,620
Chief!

126
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,200
This is bad!

127
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,520
What's good for your fever?

128
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,360
Give me Nakagawa's coat and iron.

129
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,060
Okay.

130
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,040
Reiko, there's an actual futon...

131
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah, I'm going to get daikon!

132
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,800
Hey, why is he going to get some daikon?

133
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,460
Well then..

134
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
The hot pot...

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,560
That's where you put it, right?

136
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,580
No.

137
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,620
No.

138
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,440
That's the futon.

139
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay.

140
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,320
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,540
I have some medicine so, I should be in bed for a while.

142
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,220
I'm fine.

143
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,200
Why don't you rest here for a while,

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,320
and then send her home after you calm down?

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,960
Right.

146
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,460
I'm such a big boy.

147
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't know what you're talking about, so you don't have to talk, boss.

148
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,140
When the death comes, I'll greet you.

149
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Don't forget to wake me up.

150
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,960
Boss!

151
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,680
Boss!

152
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,620
Boss!

153
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,440
Boss!

154
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,460
Boss!

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Boss!

156
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,540
You're so clumsy!

157
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,460
Listen!

158
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,480
Now that you've gone to Daigo,

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
we'll have to get through this.

160
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,520
Yes, sir!

161
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,480
Excuse me!

162
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
Here they come!

163
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,500
Hello!

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,620
Hey!

165
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,200
What's up?

166
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,300
It's the day of the factory!

167
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,000
What's this plastic thing?

168
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,200
It's a figure from the Robodeca Banjo I ordered from the factory.

169
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,920
The Robodeca Banjo?

170
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,960
It's the character from the manga you were working on, right?

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,960
You can have it delivered to Nico Nico Ryo!

172
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,700
Yes, but the factory is a week late,

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,140
and if we don't paint it and send it to the customer,

174
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,580
it'll be a problem.

175
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,380
You're going to have a difficult time making it work.

176
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,220
You'll have to wait forever.

177
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,200
Let me go!

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,240
No wonder they get it so easy for now.

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,800
Oh!

180
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,400
No, no!

181
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,880
I hope the factory doesn't get shut down,

182
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,100
and we'll be able to get this done...

183
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,620
And so I hope the factory gets loud!

184
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,140
If we can't get things done,

185
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,780
I hope this won't turn into a nuisance!

186
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,820
You know what?

187
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm getting dizzy, but I'll go check on the chief.

188
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,720
Nakagawa.

189
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,600
Huh?

190
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,100
Look at this.

191
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,260
What's wrong with the website?

192
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,080
Here's the problem.

193
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,760
Why is my picture here?

194
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,560
Thanks to you, Roboteca Punch's figure has been ordered ten times more than it was supposed to.

195
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,140
This is a violation of the copyright!

196
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,380
I can't let this happen!

197
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,680
I can't let this happen!

198
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,780
So, if the figure's delivery is delayed, you'll be in trouble too.

199
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,340
Isn't that terrible, senpai?

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,980
Don't worry, Nakagawa. We'll take care of this.

201
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,400
I understand.

202
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
I'll help you.

203
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,380
I'll help you.

204
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,400
Then I'll have to hide this somewhere.

205
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,680
You're so honest.

206
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,560
Don't let it come out. We don't have any left.

207
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,820
I know.

208
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,600
See? It's sticking out.

209
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,700
You're so clumsy.

210
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,820
Reiko.

211
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,980
Yes?

212
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,460
What's sticking out?

213
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,900
The chief?

214
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
If the chief finds out, we'll be in trouble!

215
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,820
Shh!

216
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,080
Ryo and the others are so loud.

217
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,260
Reiko.

218
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,120
Yes?

219
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,020
What's sticking out?

220
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,340
The chief said that the fever is coming from the cold.

221
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,000
I took a shower, and my legs are numb from the unadjustable seat.

222
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,180
Please bear with it.

223
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm worse at cleaning up than you.

224
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,700
You're bragging about your long legs.

225
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,060
No, I'm not!

226
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,760
What's wrong, Reiko?

227
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,080
No, chief.

228
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,340
Whose legs are long, Reiko?

229
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,600
See? You can hear everything over there.

230
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,900
What can you hear, Reiko?

231
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,160
That's...

232
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,700
The senior is the one who's bad!

233
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,120
Which senior is bad, Reiko?

234
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,060
I'll do it to you, too.

235
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,840
What are you doing?

236
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
What are you doing?

237
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,720
What are you doing?

238
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,480
Reiko!

239
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,180
What are you doing? I don't know.

240
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,360
I can't hear you!

241
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,420
Reiko!

242
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,520
Yes, chief.

243
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,480
I think the inspector will be here soon.

244
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,480
No, chief.

245
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,620
You have to sleep.

246
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,500
I'll wake you up when he comes.

247
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,260
I'm sorry, Reiko.

248
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,840
Yes, chief.

249
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,120
You won't be able to sleep all day today.

250
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,120
It's not a problem.

251
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,720
It's a problem.

252
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,160
There is a problem.

253
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,500
There are only empty stations.

254
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,540
Who's next?

255
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,820
Kameari.

256
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,160
What's wrong?

257
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,260
You're here?

258
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,920
That's the security guard?

259
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,760
No, it's me!

260
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,780
What? What? What?

261
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:14,980
What's wrong?

262
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
What's wrong?

263
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,300
Ryo?

264
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,600
Senpai?

265
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,520
Don't look at them. Help me!

266
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
Father?

267
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,700
Ryo?

268
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,420
You're the one who did this?

269
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,480
I didn't do it!

270
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
If you collect things like that,

271
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,300
the security guard will be very surprised.

272
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,140
I can't be a doctor anymore!

273
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,280
Father?

274
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,420
I was wrong!

275
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,240
Hey! I'm not the one who did this!

276
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,680
What?

277
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,000
Then...

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,260
You're wrong!

279
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,840
I was wrong!

280
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,280
That was close.

281
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I hope the director's fever goes down.

282
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm sure it will.

283
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,020
I really am sorry.

285
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,160
I was wrong.

286
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,340
I was wrong.

287
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,020
I have a problem.

288
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,560
I don't know why.

289
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,920
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,720
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,260
If you need anything, you can call me.

295
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,860
Yes.

296
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,480
He's really sharp.

297
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,480
He's also a tough guy.

298
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
But he's a bit of a pain.

299
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,860
But the problem starts here!

300
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,500
Help me! I'm going to be eaten to death!

301
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,780
What is that voice you hear in the back?

302
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,340
Can anyone explain it?

303
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm not sure.

304
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,200
Emergency training begins!

305
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,100
Hey, wait! You're throwing away your weapons!

306
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,360
You guys, scream!

307
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,260
Please stop!

308
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,080
The villagers are sad!

309
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,520
Please stop!

310
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,180
Who the hell are they?

311
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,640
Like this, we, the first-class officers,

312
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,700
are prepared for emergency training with a sense of tension.

313
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,960
Training, huh?

314
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,940
Emergency training, first.

315
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,900
Emergency training, first.

316
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,200
Don't bite me!

317
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,920
Don't bite me!

318
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,580
So, who's in the back?

319
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,700
Hey, hey, hey!

320
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,480
You're going to die!

321
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
Help me!

322
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,460
Who's there?

323
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,460
Super Team, fight!

324
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,380
That's tape!

325
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,880
Tape?

326
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,980
Hey, you there!

327
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,880
You're not allowed to park here!

328
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,260
You're not allowed to park here!

329
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,320
You're not allowed to park here!

330
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Move the vehicle now!

331
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,600
I'll make the biggest move expensive!

332
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,140
See? It stopped.

333
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,280
It's tape.

334
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,800
Tape, huh?

335
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,500
It's either a good or a bad.

336
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,800
Thanks to you, the worst situation has been cleared.

337
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,100
Yeah.

338
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,640
Then, I'd like to ask the representative.

339
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,640
What?

340
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,600
Representative?

341
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,900
Please call the chief, Daijiro Ohara, the chief of the patrol.

342
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,320
What should I do?

343
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,820
Um, the chief is a little...

344
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,140
I see. The chief is a blood-related person.

345
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,480
Tape.

346
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,620
Wait a minute!

347
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,340
The chief of the patrol is here!

348
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,600
Reiko!

349
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,960
I said...

350
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Then, call him. Right now.

351
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,140
He's here, but...

352
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,640
He's here, but he can't show his face.

353
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,800
Is that so?

354
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,440
You're a arrogant, arrogant, and perverse chief.

355
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,080
Tape.

356
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,540
No!

357
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,900
Reiko!

358
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,980
Oh!

359
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,340
Don't write that!

360
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,940
I'm not even a police officer.

361
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm the chief of the patrol, Daijiro Ohara!

362
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,460
I'm not qualified to be the chief of the patrol!

363
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,840
I'm going to be punished!

364
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,140
What?

365
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,340
What are you doing?

366
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm going to be punished?

367
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,900
What do you think you're talking about?

368
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,540
I've just been here to check on the police.

369
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,260
Give it back!

370
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,640
I won't.

371
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,280
Reiko, calm down!

372
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,920
The enemy is bad, Reiko.

373
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,940
Who are you two on the side?

374
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,580
The police are really arrogant and even more.

375
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,960
My name is Reiko Akimoto.

376
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,900
Write it down here!

377
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,520
I'll call the chief right now, so please wait there.

378
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,520
Ryo!

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
Ryo, it's hard!

380
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,560
This is harder!

381
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,380
The police officer wants to see the chief.

382
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,200
What should we do, Ryo?

383
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,000
What do you mean, what do you mean?

384
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
This is...

385
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,240
I said I'd call him.

386
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,880
Why did you say that?

387
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,220
If you don't want to be punished, give it back!

388
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,240
Not now!

389
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,540
What do you want me to do?

390
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,320
I'll ask for your help.

391
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,440
You're late.

392
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,960
Thank you for waiting.

393
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm the chief!

394
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,440
Chief?

395
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,400
Thank you for waiting.

396
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,720
I'm the chief, Daijiro Ohara.

397
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,020
Ryo, you can't shake hands.

398
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,620
I see.

399
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,440
What can I do for you?

400
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,200
Then...

401
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,640
Then, I'll ask you some questions.

402
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,180
What questions?

403
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,560
Ryo, you're the chief.

404
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,200
Just an easy task!

405
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,820
As expected, Senpai, if you say "yes", you'll be dependable.

406
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,880
Y-Yes.

407
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,500
Then, please种 what kind of work you doing, What are the target objects

408
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,740
Within 5 seconds...

409
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,920
Within 1 seconds, 2 seconds, 3 seconds...

410
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,780
That's an easy one.

411
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,620
We're talking about convenience.

412
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,300
Within 3 seconds.

413
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,800
Within 1 second.

414
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,020
So, by improving the staff's health,

415
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,160
and by aiming for a fun and comfortable place to work,

416
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,900
everyone's morale will increase,

417
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,380
and it will lead to the safety of the citizens' lives and a peaceful life.

418
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,800
In other words, if you think about the future,

419
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,320
it will be desirable to introduce a single computer from now on.

420
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,920
There are double beds in the break room.

421
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,960
At night, it's troublesome to lay and raise the futon one by one.

422
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
If you keep laying it, your parents will scold you.

423
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,540
Ryo-chan...

424
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,960
He's getting better and better...

425
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:00,980
Ah!

426
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,680
Digital sun plasma TV!

427
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,160
It's super thin and big.

428
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,400
The break room is small.

429
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,880
Plasma?

430
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,180
And, of course, the bath.

431
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,580
The one that produces bubbles.

432
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,360
If possible, it can be used as a sauna.

433
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,940
And it's a mountain bike for private use.

434
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,480
This is bad!

435
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,560
They'll find out!

436
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,640
-Fish! -Fish!

437
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:23,940
It's coming again!

438
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,260
It's coming again!

439
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,080
Ah!

440
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,920
It's coming again!

441
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm not done yet!

442
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,520
Let's go!

443
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm not done yet!

444
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,960
Ah, no, no, no!

445
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm not done yet!

446
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm not done yet!

447
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,320
Ah, no, no, no!

448
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,280
I can't go on!

449
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,620
Eh?

450
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,580
Is that it?

451
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:49,780
What is the end?

452
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,820
Well, what would you like to hear?

453
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,000
Ah...

454
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm going to buy something to drink with you.

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,320
Why did you do that?

456
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,340
This is a statue of Buddha and Buddha.

457
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a statue of Buddha and Buddha.

458
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,680
It's a statue of Buddha and Buddha.

459
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,920
I used to do it well with color.

460
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,880
I used to do it well with color.

461
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,860
Hey!

462
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,360
It's not up to the color.

463
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,180
I explained that there is a color.

464
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,040
I explained that there is a color.

465
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,980
Is that so?

466
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,600
I didn't see the sample.

467
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,760
So I dyed it in my favorite color.

468
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,540
The color of the flesh is the back of the face.

469
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,600
Well, here is black.

470
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,360
I'm telling you that's the face, grandma.

471
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,640
I'm telling you that's the face, grandma.

472
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,580
You are helping me with all your effort.

473
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,020
You are helping me with all your effort.

474
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,720
You are the one who is in trouble.

475
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,400
You are the one who is in trouble.

476
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,660
Ryotsu sensei.

477
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,120
Please.

478
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,800
Listen carefully.

479
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,280
From here to here is the hair.

480
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,140
I can't see the boundary with my eyes.

481
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,080
So don't make it all black.

482
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,020
Hey!

483
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,900
Don't leave me alone.

484
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,080
The examination is not over yet.

485
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,260
The heat is going down.

486
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,040
The heat is going down.

487
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,040
The heat is going down.

488
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,260
I'm getting a fever.

489
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,320
The inspector wants to see the director again.

490
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,300
The inspector wants to see the director again.

491
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,700
What should I do, Ryo?

492
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,440
What should I do?

493
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,080
What should I do?

494
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,280
If this happens, I'll go.

495
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you still need anything from me?

496
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,740
Yes.

497
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,100
Yes.

498
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,700
What are you doing?

499
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
What are you?

500
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,320
Where is Ryotsu Kankichi?

501
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
Where is Ryotsu Kankichi?

502
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,520
Where are you, the commander?

503
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,020
Where are you, the commander?

504
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Where are you, the commander?

505
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,280
Ryotsu!

506
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,120
Ryotsu!

507
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,980
Help me, senior!

508
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
You are...

509
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,440
What are you talking about?

510
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm the director!

511
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,940
You are so mean.

512
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm here, Ryotsu!

513
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,100
I'm here, Ryotsu!

514
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,660
Ryotsu!

515
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,720
Sorry I have to go back to work.

516
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm sorry...

517
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,140
Figure! Figure! Figure!

518
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I'll shoot a figure!

519
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,000
Monkey?

520
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,820
Figure?

521
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,200
Give me the money.

522
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Figure!

523
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,080
Oh no!

524
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,320
What color was this, Ryotsu?

525
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,020
I'm a big flower!

526
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,780
Ryotsu!

527
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,880
Don't say that!

528
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,660
I think you need to be strong to protect your safety and safety at home.

529
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,780
And I want you to watch the hard work of the police officers who are doing the same.

530
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,280
I strongly want the police officers to know.

531
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,860
On rainy days, windy days, and snowy days,

532
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,040
there are still many things to do before the Kamenari Park.

533
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,080
I'll explain it to you.

534
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,540
This is...

535
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,880
Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!

536
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,200
Rain Bad!

537
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,940
Oh my!

538
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh my!

539
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,860
Five people work for the police officers before the Kamenari Park.

540
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,680
They are going to the Pyozan office.

541
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,840
What should I do here?

542
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,620
On rainy days, windy days, and snowy days,

543
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,960
there are still many things to do before the Kamenari Park.

544
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm glad there are many things to do before the Kamenari Park.

545
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm glad there are many things to do before the Kamenari Park.

546
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,800
I can say this!

547
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,420
Thank you!

548
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,300
The evening after the rain

549
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,580
like someone's calling

550
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,720
Looked back while walking

551
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,780
in the morning, pulling my mom's hand

552
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,380
At that time, I felt

553
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,460
a mysterious feeling

554
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,300
So, I walked around Ake-dogai's yard

555
