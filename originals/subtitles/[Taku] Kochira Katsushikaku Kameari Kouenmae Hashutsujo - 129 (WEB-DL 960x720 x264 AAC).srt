1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,380
When you watch TV,

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,080
Make the room brighter and try to look away.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,820
I look at the sunset floating on the river.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,760
I look at the sunset floating on the river.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,400
I throw a stone, and it flies to the shoe.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,960
I wonder if it's a joke.

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,760
I was laughed at as it was.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160
I wonder if it's a joke.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:51,760
I wonder if it's a joke.

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,780
Even as a little boy, a child with no age

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,880
The cityscape of a cat purring won't change.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,940
It's so kind.

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,680
From the floodgates of the cat's hat

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,440
From the floodgates of the cat's hat

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,400
To Kaishakuten

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,420
The sunset falls.

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,480
Falling

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,760
Tomorrow will end like this

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,200
But I realized that I lost happiness again

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,620
Because I'm stupid

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,560
Because I'm stupid

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,700
Kanrui! The first sight of the Terai

23
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,480
It's about noon.

24
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,240
Do you want to have some katsudon?

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,860
Ryo-san, please have mine too.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,900
What is it, Terai?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Isn't today lunch?

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,600
Then you have some katsudon too.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,620
No, it's Morisoba.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,980
What? Morisoba?

31
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,360
You just got paid.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
The loan is too tight.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,740
I can only get 5,000 yen a month.

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,740
It's a good idea to get married.

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,760
Mr. Omawari!

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,820
What's wrong?

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,100
I forgot my wallet.

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm in a hurry, Mr. Omawari.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,320
Can you lend me 5,000 yen?

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
5,000 yen?

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,480
Please.

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,600
Kanada!

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll pay it back.

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,320
I'll be in a hurry.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,420
I beg you!

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,140
I'm sorry!

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,900
I'll get it back.

48
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,460
I don't have time.

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,600
That's right.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,300
We can have a katsudon and a morisoba at the branch.

51
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,720
Ryo-san, tanma!

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
Can you take out my morisoba?

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,480
What?

54
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,700
Didn't you ask for 5,000 yen?

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,060
You didn't even ask for a name or address?

56
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,240
Yeah, it's not someone around here.

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,580
I didn't see him.

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,100
You're an idiot.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,080
Then he must have spent 5000 yen on something.

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,300
He won't come back for sure.

61
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,780
I wonder.

62
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,280
Come on.

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,540
In this harsh world,

64
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,240
if you see people, you think they're thieves.

65
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,700
That's the way modern people are.

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,620
I can't help it.

67
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,140
If you can't help it, you don't need the police.

68
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,660
I'm telling you, I won't let you do my job.

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,240
Okay.

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Hey!

71
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,380
Hey.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,420
Oh, this is Mr. Terai and Mr. Ryo.

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Good work on the patrol.

74
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,720
You're on a diet and you don't have a job?

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,540
You're taking a dog walk?

76
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,380
You're so nice.

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,580
I'm not on a diet.

78
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,080
I'm on a job.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
Oh, really?

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,880
I always see you at the pachinko place.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,640
Don't worry.

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm the same when I don't have a job.

83
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,020
Right, Pochi?

84
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,300
What?

85
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm John.

86
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,440
Right, John?

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,120
You're so annoying, John.

88
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm so attached to Mr. Terai.

89
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,080
Dogs and cats are popular with Terai.

90
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,780
Hey, Grandpa, Grandma, how are you?

91
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,840
Hi, Matsui.

92
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,680
Hi, Kiyohara.

93
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,460
How's your back?

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
Oh, Mr. Terai.

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,320
Oh, Mr. Takahashi.

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,660
Did you find the missing number?

97
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,060
Yes.

98
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,440
I found it.

99
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
I found it.

100
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,460
Oh, I see.

101
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,760
Bye.

102
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,600
Hey, do you know the address of that old woman?

103
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,700
Well, yeah.

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,720
Communication with local residents is important.

105
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
It's for when the time comes.

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
When the time comes?

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,960
What kind of when the time comes can you find the address?

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, there's a dog barking right ahead of here.

109
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,100
Let's go from here.

110
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,880
That dog has been in the hospital for a day because of the cold.

111
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,620
Yeah.

112
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,420
Grandma, watch out!

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,700
I'll do it for you.

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,320
Oh, Mr. Terai, I'm sorry.

115
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,800
Hey, Mr. Terai, we're patrolling.

116
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
I think it's better than a pachinko.

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,600
What do you think, Grandma?

118
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,740
After your grandpa died,

119
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,140
you're all alone and lonely, aren't you?

120
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,540
That's not true.

121
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,220
Recently, Genjiro, the third-born, has made a tea-octopus friend.

122
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,840
He's going to karaoke.

123
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,720
Right, Grandma?

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,580
I don't want to, Mr. Terai.

125
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,020
I know everything.

126
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,960
Speaking of the third-born,

127
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,320
you know Mr. Kawata, the tofu shop's owner, right?

128
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,280
Oh, the one with the big, big belly?

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,120
Oh, dear.

130
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,820
I'm tired of it.

131
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,600
It took me three hours just to go around there.

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,520
It took me three hours just to go around there.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,220
Mr. Terai is a local-based guy.

134
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
Mr. Terai is a local-based guy.

135
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,520
He always calls people who come to him.

136
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
He always calls people who come to him.

137
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,360
He always calls people who come to him.

138
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,000
It's like he has to do a sent-out banter

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,920
whenever there's a runner in baseball.

140
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,340
He always does a sent-out banter.

141
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,680
He's a life-saving guy.

142
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,720
He's a life-saving guy.

143
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,580
But that's important for a police officer.

144
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,920
Yeah, I don't know what's so funny about it

145
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,480
that I became a police officer.

146
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,080
The police officer's charm is

147
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
when he's caught a criminal.

148
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,060
When he's caught a criminal.

149
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,000
By the way,

150
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,720
have you ever been caught by a police officer?

151
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,800
I don't remember that.

152
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,020
I don't remember that either.

153
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,260
I don't know, either.

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,560
Perhaps he's never been caught

155
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
by a police officer since he was found out.

156
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,400
Perhaps he's never been caught by a police officer since he was found out.

157
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,600
Action!

158
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
Did I catch a cold?

159
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,260
Hey, that's cheating!

160
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,200
What's with the later?

161
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,380
You should've done it earlier.

162
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,380
I don't care.

163
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,480
I don't care!

164
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,880
Ouch!

165
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,780
Please be quiet!

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Huh?

167
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,960
A game where you become a detective and catch a criminal?

168
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,980
Yeah.

169
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,380
It's pretty difficult.

170
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
I see.

171
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,880
So there's a criminal in here.

172
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,020
Everyone's got a scary face.

173
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,200
By the way,

174
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,000
your dad was a police officer, too, right?

175
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,420
Yeah, by the way.

176
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,800
By the way?

177
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,040
Yeah, by the way.

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,260
I've been a police officer since you were born.

179
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,580
So, Dad,

180
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,380
you've caught a thief, right?

181
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah, I've caught a thief, right?

182
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,920
What do you feel when you catch a criminal?

183
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,880
Huh?

184
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,840
A criminal?

185
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,640
Yeah.

186
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,060
Even if you say that,

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,300
I've never had any experience.

188
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,380
What?

189
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,460
Not even once?

190
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,500
What?

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,760
Not even once?

192
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,200
I can't play games or watch a crime drama.

193
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,560
Well, if I have a chance.

194
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,020
Well, if I have a chance.

195
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,780
Well, if I have a chance.

196
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,860
Sure, sure.

197
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,460
However,

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
so if you can't play video games,

199
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,980
then I'll have to teach you a lesson.

200
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,680
deze is a story from the time

201
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,820
you haven't played a game.

202
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,720
Is the entertainment related to a game?

203
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,540
Yes, it is.

204
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh, I see.

205
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,000
Well,

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
then you go and play video games,

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,220
and learn how to play a game.

208
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll be there right away.

209
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,080
Really?

210
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,760
Yes, please.

211
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,580
We're going to arrest the culprit.

212
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,380
Reiko and Nakagawa, head south, Ryotsu and Terai, head north.

213
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,080
Yes, sir!

214
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,380
Hey, chief!

215
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,400
What is it, Ryotsu?

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,480
If you arrest the culprit, will you get a reward?

217
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,380
A reward?

218
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,420
If you do a home run, you get a home run prize.

219
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,080
If you play double, you get a double play prize.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,020
Idiot! This isn't a game!

221
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,460
Oh, I don't want to!

222
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,740
I'm just yelling at you, so I don't feel motivated.

223
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,820
If you arrest the culprit, I'll treat you to a drink.

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
Right, chief?

225
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,920
All right.

226
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,840
If you arrest the culprit, I'll treat you to a drink.

227
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,280
No, chief! I like it!

228
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,820
Let's go, Terai!

229
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,060
Let's start with the basic rules of the investigation, Ryo.

230
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,000
This is...

231
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,660
Ryo, you're going to hit me one by one?

232
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,440
The chief often advises us to pile up small things.

233
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,260
That's like sending a bandit without a runner.

234
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,380
There should be a faster way.

235
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,420
This is the Chirigami Port, as usual.

236
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,520
First, from that block.

237
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,620
That's it!

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,440
What?

239
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,640
This is the Kouenbai Post Office, as usual.

240
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes, sir.

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,140
We ask for your cooperation.

242
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,640
All residents please show your faces.

243
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,900
This is how you'll investigate, Ryo?

244
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,000
Shut up. Leave it to me.

245
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,660
Those who don't show their faces will be considered guilty as the culprit

246
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,920
and be arrested.

247
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,660
Huh?

248
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,420
What's going on?

249
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,440
Is there anyone here, Terai?

250
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,320
Well...

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,160
Well...

252
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
Oh, are you there?

253
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Saito-san from the 4th floor has retired.

254
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,700
What?

255
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,120
No, that's not it. We're looking for the culprit.

256
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,500
The culprit isn't here.

257
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm so glad.

258
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,820
You're so glad, aren't you?

259
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,220
I have a good idea.

260
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,680
What?

261
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,520
How about this?

262
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,140
Call the people there to arrest them all.

263
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,560
The culprit must be the one who runs away in a hurry.

264
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,680
Will it work?

265
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,080
I'll throw a sword ball at them.

266
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,160
Is there anyone around?

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,020
You're a suspicious man!

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
Hey, don't arrest me!

269
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,640
Ryo-san, you ran away!

270
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,720
I'm going to arrest you right now!

271
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,120
I'm going to arrest you!

272
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,400
Wait!

273
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,180
This way is the shortcut!

274
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,380
Motoki-san's precious flower!

275
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,460
This is good.

276
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,460
What?

277
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,240
Ryo-san?

278
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,420
I'm in trouble!

279
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,440
You're in trouble!

280
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,240
Get a hold of yourself!

281
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,440
Take care!

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Tsu-no 0075!

283
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,980
We're going to make a witness!

284
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,820
All right!

285
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,800
I got you!

286
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,480
Ryo-san, I'll take charge!

287
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,620
Seori!

288
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,340
Hey!

289
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,180
Seori!

290
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,060
Seori!

291
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,120
Come out!

292
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,920
Sorry, it didn't hurt.

293
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,560
Why? You're a fool!

294
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,840
You idiot! Why did you run away?

295
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,320
No, I thought if I found Saori's figure,

296
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
I would be told something again.

297
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,720
You're such a troublemaker.

298
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,300
Let's go, Terai.

299
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,940
Ryo, where are you going?

300
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,680
That naughty dog is in the hospital because of the cold.

301
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,780
Ryo! Ryo! Ryo!

302
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,460
The police is here!

303
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
You idiot! Hurry up and say that!

304
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,620
In this case, we'll have to arrest him first and then find out who the culprit is.

305
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,500
Is it really okay to do something like this, Ryo?

306
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,980
It's okay. The police officer's job is to arrest the culprit.

307
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,020
We'll have to do it a little forcefully.

308
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,860
I-I guess so...

309
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,640
Let's go!

310
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,700
We're going to arrest him!

311
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,980
What's going on, Ryo? Is the culprit here?

312
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,240
Um...um...

313
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,300
He's not here, Ryo.

314
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,420
Okay, next!

315
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,980
Why are we the ones being arrested?

316
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,060
That's too much.

317
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,540
Let's ask him about it, Ryo.

318
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,760
That old lady knows a lot about people around here.

319
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,920
I'll go ask her.

320
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,460
Yeah, hey!

321
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,820
Terai!

322
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,520
This is getting a little annoying.

323
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,360
Hm?

324
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,300
Is this a new store today?

325
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,340
We've got to go.

326
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,680
Ryo! Ryo!

327
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,800
I heard something nice!

328
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,360
What?

329
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,420
Where did he go?

330
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,840
I've been trying to get information about people who moved here lately.

331
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,080
I can hear his heart beating.

332
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,700
He's got a sweet taste.

333
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,860
Why is the police here?

334
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,180
I don't know.

335
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,920
That's not good, isn't it?

336
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,840
What?

337
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,000
No good.

338
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,380
I knew it.

339
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,600
This line is more...

340
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,080
No, that's it.

341
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,400
No good.

342
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,160
I-I'm in a bad mood right now.

343
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,740
I'm in a bad mood...

344
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,400
Hey, wait!

345
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,120
Huh?

346
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
There's still some bullets left.

347
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,800
What?

348
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,740
No...

349
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,280
I went to the bathroom...

350
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,420
Hey, you!

351
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,160
It's time for the 0075!

352
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,280
Get outta here!

353
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,220
Hey, wait!

354
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,140
You're going to die!

355
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,660
Ugh!

356
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,360
Where did Ryo-san go?

357
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,780
Hm?

358
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,240
What the...?

359
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,780
Wait!

360
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,700
I'm not waiting!

361
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,240
Get him!

362
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,080
What are you doing?!

363
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,640
Wait!

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,680
Wait!

365
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,440
Damn it! You got away!

366
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,660
It was only a little while ago.

367
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,100
But now...

368
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,800
It's all because you're so slow.

369
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,600
That's why you can't catch the culprit.

370
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,840
What do you feel when you catch the culprit?

371
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,540
Even if you say that, I don't have any experience.

372
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,520
What? You don't have any experience?

373
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,240
I don't think I can do it.

374
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,620
I can't...

375
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,220
What?!

376
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,640
Ryo, look at this!

377
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,960
What? What's wrong with the 10-yen coin?

378
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,160
This 10-yen coin was dropped by the culprit.

379
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,060
This 10-yen coin with the scratches is...

380
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,400
Hey, old lady.

381
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,900
I wonder if anyone has moved here recently.

382
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,640
Recently?

383
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,540
Oh, there's a turtle over there.

384
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,680
Two of them.

385
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,400
Over there...

386
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,440
Three of them in Okatsushika.

387
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,220
And two in Okirasou in Nichome.

388
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,200
You're really knowledgeable.

389
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,780
I wonder if you know anything else about them.

390
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,120
I wonder...

391
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,840
Oh, right.

392
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,940
There's a new person who moved to Okirasou.

393
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,940
I think his name is Tsuruta.

394
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,320
He has a 10-yen coin with the old horror and Giza-giza.

395
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,680
He has a 10-yen coin with Giza-giza written on it.

396
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,740
He likes saving it as his hobby.

397
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,880
When he gets the continuation, he said...

398
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,100
No way!

399
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
What are you thinking about?

400
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,280
Go away morons!

401
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,480
That's the 007!

402
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,800
This is it.

403
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,480
Great, you go around you.

404
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,220
You!

405
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,020
Tsuruta-san, this is your delivery.

406
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,720
Here, I'll open it now.

407
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,580
You're the one!

408
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,140
The one from before!

409
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,480
Arrest him!

410
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,380
I told you, Terai!

411
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,260
I-I'll arrest him!

412
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,940
Tsuruta!

413
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,440
What are you doing?

414
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,920
Stop!

415
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,760
Wait!

416
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,320
Stop!

417
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,360
Wait for the chief!

418
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,880
Wait!

419
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,880
What?

420
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,880
Give me the alcohol!

421
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,140
What is this?

422
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,080
Wait!

423
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,000
I told you to wait!

424
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,040
I can't do this.

425
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,180
Damn it, did you lose sight of me?

426
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,340
I'm slow and I'm not good at fighting.

427
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,100
I'm not good at fighting either.

428
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm not good at arresting criminals.

429
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,960
Oh...

430
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,940
That's why you can't arrest a criminal!

431
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,480
You better hold on.

432
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,240
I'm not going to let you down!

433
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,100
That's right!

434
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,740
Oh...

435
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
"I'm not going to let you down"

436
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:22,940
"I'm not going to let you down"

437
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm not going to let you down!

438
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,360
Look at this one.

439
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,080
This guy is...

440
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,540
It hurts!

441
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,980
Terai, arrest him!

442
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,020
I-I'm not going to let the one from before!

443
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,800
I'm arresting him!

444
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,320
I'm not going to let you down!

445
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,220
Even if you're dead...

446
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm not giving you away!

447
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,660
All right.

448
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm going to kill you!

449
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,360
Calm down, Terai!

450
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,040
What are you talking about, Maruka?

451
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,000
It's the first time I've ever arrested a criminal.

452
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,600
I'll do it, I'll do it!

453
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,180
I'm going to run away! I'm going to run away!

454
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,740
Calm down, Terai.

455
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,720
You're not a chicken.

456
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,300
Don't tighten your neck like that.

457
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,900
Put your hands on your head.

458
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,260
Hands...

459
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,020
Don't put your hands on your neck!

460
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,160
Hands...

461
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,460
I see.

462
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,600
It's the first time.

463
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,940
Hurry up! You're going to die!

464
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,200
The serial killer of the year!

465
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,320
The national police station!

466
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
The prison cell 007!

467
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,900
We're arresting you!

468
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,960
This feeling is a free feeling as a policeman.

469
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,360
I feel like I'll never have another chance.

470
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,840
I want to feel this excitement again.

471
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
The serial killer of the year!

472
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
The national police station!

473
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,780
The prison cell 007!

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,740
We're arresting you!

475
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,580
The serial killer of the year!

476
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,640
The national police station!

477
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:00,680
The prison cell 007!

478
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,700
This refreshing feeling that permeates deep into my heart.

479
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,060
Terai Yoichi, this is the biggest feeling in my life.

480
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,980
Okay, I'm going to burn this feeling in my heart for 10 more times.

481
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,220
Stop it!

482
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,420
That's enough!

483
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,460
Anyway, I'll go to the station.

484
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,840
I'll go to the station.

485
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,540
I did it, Terai!

486
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,400
Ryo-san...

487
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,380
Yeah.

488
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,840
This is the captain's treat for today.

489
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Wait, Ryo-san.

490
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,060
What?

491
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,820
Since we're here...

492
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,540
Huh?

493
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,420
It's done, Ryo-san!

494
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,260
You're already feeling it?

495
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,920
Okay, then.

496
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,820
Oh, by the way...

497
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,160
Please sign this to commemorate your arrest.

498
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,080
What?

499
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,940
What is this?

500
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,200
One...

501
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,460
Two...

502
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,240
Four...

503
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,120
Seven...

504
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,700
Eight...

505
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:01,720
Ten...

506
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,280
Four...

507
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,300
Seven...

508
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,320
Eight...

509
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,440
Nine...

510
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,820
Fif...

511
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,340
Ten...

512
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,620
Eleven...

513
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,560
Ten...

514
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,700
Twelve...

515
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,160
Three...

516
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,280
Four...

517
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,960
I was able to arrest the culprit because of the patrol.

518
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,820
I want to be watched closely by some of you.

519
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
Well, well, Chief.

520
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,660
It's a happy day today.

521
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,900
Let's go as promised.

522
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,720
With the chief's permission.

523
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,120
I'm sorry.

524
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,220
Oh, the last time.

525
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,220
Thank you for the other day.

526
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,880
No...

527
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,960
Here.

528
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,920
Please eat this with the 5,000 yen you borrowed.

529
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
What do you mean?

530
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,480
I didn't know you were really coming to return it.

531
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,120
I see.

532
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm glad I could help you.

533
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,120
Please come anytime if you have any trouble.

534
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,660
No, I was in a hurry because of my wife.

535
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,020
I was really helped.

536
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,340
So, you were born safely?

537
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,560
Thanks to you, I have a healthy boy.

538
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,660
And he is a twin.

539
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,320
That's great.

540
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,140
And what's your name?

541
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,900
My name is...

542
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,200
What do you live in?

543
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,160
I live in Koji and Kenji.

544
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
The address is the next corner of the second intersection.

545
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
It's the house on the corner to the left.

546
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,300
It's good to arrest three people.

547
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,360
After all, that kind of figure suits the temple priest the best.

548
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:19,940
Really?

549
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,100
Well, sometimes it's a farewell or a final destination.

550
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,020
But I'm going to go with the life of a manly home run.

551
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,960
You have more three-dimensional.

552
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,120
Oh, oh, oh.

553
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm from Kobe.

554
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,520
Beef is delicious.

555
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,320
Did something good happen to you?

556
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,200
No, nothing.

557
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,660
Come on, let's eat.

558
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,760
Yes.

559
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,660
Here, have a meal.

560
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm hungry.

561
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,980
Oh, I have dinner too.

562
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,800
We did.

563
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:25,900
It's a become-lady.

564
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,560
See ya, baby.

565
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,640
Hello, Oh.

566
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,000
You didn't believe it, did you?

567
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,520
Yes, what's the matter, boss?

568
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,640
What's your name?

569
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,320
It's Umi.

570
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,740
I want to make friends with you

571
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:47,300
I want to be loved by you

572
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,260
The more we say it, the more we feel like we're melting

573
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:02,020
I want to break up with you

574
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,880
For some reason, love is cowardly

575
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,460
Don't hide all the strong things

576
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,260
Don't hide all the strong things

577
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:43,720
Don't hide all the strong things
