I'll take care of it.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's take the luggage.

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,320
I'll help you.

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,300
Chief Ohara, I'll take you to the public place.

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,980
That's the true police officer.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,680
What about you, Ryo-tsu?

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,340
I went out on patrol, but I was with Honda-san at 10 o'clock last night.

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,960
It's bad. The chief's order is already on.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
It's not good.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I went too far with the center of gravity.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,940
I can't believe you want to see me.

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,860
I thought you'd come back by dawn.

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:46,540
It's a nuisance to say that we're in trouble.

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,700
Let's get rid of them at all costs.

39
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,100
Leave it to me.

40
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,920
You're coming, aren't you?

41
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,640
Why are you playing hard to get alone on that wide square?

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,680
That's what I'm after, you sons of bitches.

43
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,780
The island of the violence special.

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,720
I'm not letting any huge annoying thing get inside the square.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,660
You think you can compete with us?

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
That's not true.

47
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,740
"Honda Hayato"

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,240
They're a tough bunch.

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,800
They're 10 years ahead of us.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,880
They're strong.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,180
Who are you?

52
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm Honda Hayato from the Aircraft Division.

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
I'm a later Honda.

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm Ryo-tsu from the Kamiyari Park.

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,980
If you have a problem, I'll be your opponent anytime!

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,020
You remember that, right?

57
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,500
Honda Ryo-tsu.

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm sure the director will give us good reviews this morning.

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,400
The garrison has crushed two of them.

60
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,460
I should beat them up with this.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm hurt.

62
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,520
Don't worry.

63
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,420
You're going to be fine.

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Really?

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,020
I'm glad it happened.

66
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,500
Good morning.

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,780
Sorry for being late.

68
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,840
Ryo-tsu!

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,360
Honda!

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,620
I'm going to be your opponent.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,360
What the hell did you do?

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,880
I just got a call from the office.

73
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,820
Uh...

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,140
What?

75
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,600
You're banning me from going home?

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,920
No...

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,600
What?

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,540
What the hell is going on?

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,180
Nothing at all!

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,900
I've figured it out!

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,900
Thanks to you, the phone's been ringing since a while ago!

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,260
I-I'm really sorry.

83
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,940
This is my director, Fuyuki Todoki.

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,000
Ugh, you guys!

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,260
Lower your heads!

86
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

87
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,160
Wait, wait, wait!

88
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,160
We were the ones who defeated the tyrants!

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,820
Why do you have to punish us?

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
You guys!

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,840
You're all the general public!

92
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,720
What?

93
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,720
We're all in shock, everyone!

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,400
Ryotsu!

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,820
This month is the month of the intercourse with the local people!

96
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,420
And yet, you...

97
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,960
You've just ruined the trust of the citizens!

98
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,840
I'll punish you again!

99
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,380
I'll tell you the truth.

100
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,080
I'll ban Ryotsu Honda for a week from today.

101
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,200
And I'll reflect on my actions.

102
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,880
What? Banning at home is the same as getting a vacation.

103
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,580
I'll make a plumber.

104
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,700
What a annoying guy.

105
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,380
You didn't get a single penny, but you got a week off.

106
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,940
You should be happier.

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,080
But I can't ride a motorcycle for a while.

108
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,460
What should I do?

109
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,480
Do what you want.

110
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,440
Don't you have any hobbies?

111
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,740
I don't have any hobbies other than motorcycles.

112
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,620
By the way, I don't think you're doing anything.

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
If you don't have anything to do, just sleep in your room.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,780
Two weeks is too short.

115
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,060
What?

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
What?

117
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,260
What was that?

118
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,420
A motorcycle.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,180
Honda, where are you?

120
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,220
My motorcycle.

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,300
Where is my motorcycle?

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
My motorcycle.

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,100
I haven't made a plumber yet.

124
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,900
My motorcycle is here.

125
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,020
Stop it.

126
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,620
Stop it.

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,040
I bought it from America.

128
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,020
Yamaha V-Largo XV 400.

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
It's a real-type model.

130
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,240
I paid 500 dollars.

131
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,600
It's a small motorcycle.

132
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,260
I can't get it anymore because it's on sale.

133
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,660
Where is my motorcycle?

134
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,280
Stop.

135
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,640
As long as he's here, I can't live a happy life.

136
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,120
I have to do something.

137
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,420
Ryo, are you there?

139
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm waiting.

140
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,860
I brought a lot of things.

141
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
What will you use them for?

142
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,780
Let Honda have hobbies.

143
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,540
Hobbies other than motorcycle?

144
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,820
Yes.

145
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,540
Look at that.

146
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,140
Honda.

147
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480
Are you okay?

148
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,120
Ouch. Why am I here?

149
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,080
I just didn't ride a bike for a day.

150
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,220
This is serious.

151
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,360
Honda is like a jobless employee.

152
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,340
A jobless man is married to a jobless woman.

153
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,640
Especially a boss. That's the worst.

154
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,660
What did I do?

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,680
What?

156
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,040
Chief! Why are you here?

157
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm responsible for your management.

158
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,420
I came to see you so that you don't cause trouble during your break.

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,440
The problem has already occurred.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,240
Idiot! What are you thinking?

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,520
Break is a time of reflection.

163
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,120
You can't take it as a hobby.

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,820
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,020
Chief, look at this.

166
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,340
Where is my bike?

167
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,720
You haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

168
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,480
You'll get sick if you keep this up.

169
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,580
You may never be able to return to work.

170
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,520
No way.

171
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
Honda is a capable company.

172
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,440
Of course, you will be responsible for it.

173
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,600
You are fired from the management department.

174
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,380
And your rent will be reduced to zero.

175
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,540
That's why you are abandoned.

176
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,560
Let's go.

177
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
The police will concentrate on your family.

178
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,160
Maybe you should consider your service after you leave the esto.

179
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,700
So you will be given more attention and more time.

180
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,600
There are no job opportunities.

181
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,860
I know it.

182
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,220
However.

183
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,500
The canvas you wear is important.

184
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,520
It will make your life easier.

185
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,360
Do you understand?

186
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,340
Eh?

187
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,580
Do you understand?

188
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,240
Hmm...

189
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,780
I-I got it. I'll give you a special permission.

190
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,460
Thank you very much.

191
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,500
That is the reason why I am the head of the club.

192
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,620
Because I'm good at putting people on the line.

193
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,720
Ryo-chan's unique skill.

194
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,980
A hobby is as good as being away from work.

195
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,700
A job is like that, and the words of a human who only does hobbies are very convincing.

196
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,820
Don't be so mean!

197
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,360
In the case of women, they are as far away from the motorcycle as possible.

198
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,440
How about collecting coins?

199
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,080
Collecting coins...

200
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah, we can start from today.

201
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,420
It's the effect of Japan.

202
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,460
5 yen, 10 yen, 100 yen, 500 yen.

203
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,200
The 10 yen coin in the Showa 26 is worth more than 100 yen.

204
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,640
I see. Collecting coins.

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh, this is like a motorcycle wheel.

206
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,680
I see.

207
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,140
It's perfect for you.

208
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
How about a real motorcycle wheel?

209
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,980
Chief, you can't do that.

210
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,380
You should say something that makes me think of a motorcycle.

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

212
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,820
That's right. How about a knitting machine?

213
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,120
I'm sure it's perfect for Mr. Honda.

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,900
Knitting machine?

215
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,020
That's right. I think we can easily make a muffler.

216
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,780
Muffler...

217
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,940
Muffler...

218
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,340
Dance is popular now.

219
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,500
It's a folk dance.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,140
Folk...

221
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,860
Folk...

222
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,800
That's right.

223
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm reading it.

224
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,620
The story of the Trap family of the Trap Dan Shaku is moving.

225
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,120
Dan Shaku, Dan Shaku, Tan Shaku, Tan Shaku...

226
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,540
I like the dubbing the most.

227
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,100
Chief, you should do it quietly.

228
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,560
You should be quiet and dance.

229
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,100
Muffler...

231
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,460
Muffler...

232
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,600
Muffler...

233
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,740
Muffler...

234
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:12,780
Muffler...

235
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm going to go.

236
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,700
You're the owner.

237
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
Let's go, Mr. Honda.

238
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,200
I'll be waiting for you.

239
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,540
Good morning, senpai.

240
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,160
Are you awake, Ryo-chan?

241
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,560
Hey, you came. Come in without me.

242
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,460
Excuse me.

243
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,520
It'll be over soon, so wait.

244
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:55,600
Wait.

245
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,780
Were you playing games at night?

246
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,000
I couldn't sleep because of him.

247
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:21,780
What are you doing?

248
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,000
You know, I'm going to crush him one by one every second.

249
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,960
I can ride the bike with 430,922 pieces of crushed bones.

250
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,640
Do you plan to continue that work during your rest?

251
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,380
It'll be a silver-diamond picture.

252
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,560
All right, I'm done.

253
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,060
Well, Honda, let's start.

254
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,680
What do you mean, start?

255
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,320
You can tell by looking at Nakagawa and Reiko's clothes.

256
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,000
It's tennis.

257
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,680
It's tennis.

258
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,720
It's tennis.

259
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,080
It's a great hobby.

260
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,640
It's popular regardless of age.

261
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,000
And Japanese women's tennis is world-class.

262
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,540
If you don't play tennis now, you can't be called Japanese.

263
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,100
I failed in the cultural field yesterday.

264
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,440
I decided to go in the sports field today.

265
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,780
It's before work, so I can't be with you for too long.

266
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,140
Let's move your body a little.

267
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,440
You can refresh yourself.

268
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,420
It's okay. I'm doing this.

269
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,660
If you do that, you'll feel bad.

270
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,160
Get ready for the race.

271
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,080
Go on.

272
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,200
Oh, my God!

273
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,940
If I play tennis, my body will break.

274
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,340
What the hell does a bike ride mean?

275
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,080
Ryozu, are you there?

276
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,280
Ryozu, Honda, you're in trouble.

277
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,480
I won't allow it anymore.

278
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,420
Trouble?

279
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,000
What's wrong, Chief?

280
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
It's not about what's wrong.

281
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,280
They went to work last night.

282
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,240
They had a big scene at the Kanna.

283
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,060
What?

284
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,180
At around 2:00 last night,

285
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,180
two groups of people who are known as the "Ryotsu" of the Kouki Honda Kameari Park,

286
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,560
appeared in Kanna-na-dori.

287
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,340
They were arrested and were forced to wear many cars.

288
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,200
The Honda and Ryotsu are here!

289
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,940
There are a lot of police officers!

290
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,120
The Kouki army is on the way, so it's a big mess!

291
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
That's not us!

292
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,640
Shut up!

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,480
Then, do you think you're fake?

294
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,960
According to the witnesses, you two are sure about it.

295
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
No way!

296
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,760
The official statement will be released in a few days,

297
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,960
but the Honda is probably a "choukai menshoku" with a license and a license plate.

298
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,280
Choukai... Choukai menshoku!

299
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,480
Ryotsu is no doubt a "choukai menshoku"!

300
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,140
Until the conclusion is made, stay quiet in the dorm.

301
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Okay? Don't go outside!

302
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,060
Anyway, I don't believe that you're just ignoring the police and going around outside!

303
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,560
You're right.

304
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,180
It's natural for you to think that someone is talking about you and going around.

305
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,880
You think I'm not trusting you because you believe in me?

306
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
No, that's not it.

307
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,840
If you think like that, you'll...

308
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,720
Huh? He was here a while ago!

309
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,420
What?

310
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,960
Honda!

311
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,740
That guy!

312
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,740
No way!

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,840
Honda!

314
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
Nakagawa!

315
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,180
Yes!

316
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,960
Renko!

317
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,420
Yes!

318
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,020
Mr. Honda!

319
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,760
Mr. Honda!

320
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,200
Honda!

321
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,260
Honda!

322
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,660
Stop it, you idiot!

323
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,180
What are you going to do when you die?

324
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,540
What are you doing?

325
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,260
Mr. Honda!

326
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,560
Calm down.

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
I'm sure the truth will be revealed soon.

328
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,620
And we'll be able to solve the problem.

329
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,680
That's right.

330
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,680
You have to be careful, Mr. Honda!

331
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,880
If you die, your father, your mother, your sister, and your brother will be sad!

332
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,000
What are you talking about?

333
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm just...

334
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm just looking at the motorcycle.

335
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,460
What?

336
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,680
Don't do anything stupid!

337
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,760
Mr. Honda!

338
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,320
Ryo!

339
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,700
Ouch!

340
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,140
You're not moving, Ryo.

341
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm the one who got the scratch.

343
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,540
If I were a normal person, I'd be in big trouble.

344
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,100
I had to do everything myself.

345
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
I did everything for my mother.

346
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,620
Anyway, there's nothing you can do now.

347
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,480
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,540
Ryo, you're no good.

350
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,200
You're miserable.

351
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,220
You're not even a normal person.

352
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,600
However, You saved me.

353
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,580
Someone has to pay for your death.

354
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,720
I'll fix it.

355
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,160
Next, it's your turn!

356
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,220
You have to do it together with me.

357
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,260
Ryo.

358
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,520
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,620
The police are making a scene!

360
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,540
If we cause trouble today, Toyomi's neck will be cut off!

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,860
Oh, now it's Honda's turn!

362
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,820
Let's go, Ryochi's boss!

363
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,260
Yeah!

364
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,140
Hey, hey!

365
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,400
Clear the road!

366
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,500
To Kouki's Honda!

367
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,680
There's a ryochi from Poemai Hashijyo who has no money!

368
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,980
What are you doing!?

369
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,840
I hate red cars!

370
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,840
You can pay 50,000 yen if you like them!

371
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,420
No, no!

372
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,320
Don't hesitate!

373
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,480
I'll give you!

374
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,500
This is Kouki's Honda!

375
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
It's a ryochi from Poemai Hashijyo!

376
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,860
If you really have it, come on and get it!

377
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,700
Yeah!

378
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,440
What's that?

379
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,960
Don't let him get away!

380
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,780
I'll clear the road!

381
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,640
Let's go, Honda!

382
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,040
But...

383
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,100
How do we get down from here?

384
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
I don't know!

385
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,620
What's that?

386
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,460
You don't have to say it!

387
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,200
Get on!

388
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,960
Get off quickly!

389
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,980
Hey you freaks!

390
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,060
Get ready!

391
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,120
Let's go, Ryochi's boss!

392
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,720
Yeah!

393
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,120
Let's go!

394
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,720
Yaaay!

395
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,380
Let's go!

396
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,500
Yaaay!

397
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Wh- what's that?

398
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
You really did tell us our names!

399
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,120
You guys are not getting away with this!

400
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,720
It's the real thing!

401
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,400
I'll catch you!

402
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,780
Don't let him get away!

403
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,760
I don't care!

404
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,460
Ran right through them!

405
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,420
I'm fine!

406
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,500
I knew it.

407
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,720
Move!

408
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,020
Don't come here!

409
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,840
It's a souvenir!

410
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,420
It's 736 yen.

411
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:37,960
Welcome.

412
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,840
UNDERSTOOD!

413
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,500
What the...?

414
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,120
Show him your true colors!

415
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,560
Show me your power!

416
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,020
Who are you?

417
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
You're the head of the Violence Special!

418
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm the leader of Sigma!

419
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,380
I-I've been exposed!

420
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,520
I see. So the two of us were killed in the Sakagura Mission's crime!

421
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,480
What the?!

422
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,960
I'm going to die!

423
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,040
Action!

424
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,820
Damn it. What if I get fired because of Ryotsu?

425
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,700
I don't know how far I'll get!

426
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
You bastard!

427
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,940
You're the only one who didn't do anything!

428
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,460
You made me angry!

429
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,020
Go to hell, you bastards!

430
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,920
A-alright, ta-ta!

431
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,660
Let's do it.

432
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,180
We'll prove it was not our idea!

433
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
I'm gonna be able to ride my motorcycle again!

434
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,000
Gah!

435
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Y- just wait.

436
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,600
Ryo-chan, Honza, as I thought it was your job.

437
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,680
There's no reason to be so...

438
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,360
I won't forgive you. You're fired! You're fired!

439
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,560
I said you're fired! You're fired!

440
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,600
Takagawa, act more emotionally!

441
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
This is the scene of the reunion of the mother and her child who had been separated for a long time!

442
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,620
The ratings will definitely go up!

We have a good thing!

463
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,260
Outside the door

464
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,000
A sunbeam is calling us!
