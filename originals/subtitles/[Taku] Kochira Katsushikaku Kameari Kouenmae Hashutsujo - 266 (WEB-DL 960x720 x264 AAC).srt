00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,600
By statistical european

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,380
When you watch the tv, please bright up the room and look away!

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,820
Don't have money? Come to where I am!

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,420
I also don't have money, and I worry

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:27,900
Don't worry

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,740
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,860
White clouds

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,400
Sooner or later it will be somehow

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,800
I know! I know! I know!

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,120
If you understand, shut up and follow me!

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,640
I know! I know! I know!

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,420
Ryo-tsu's Prank!

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,840
Here it comes! Make it more intense!

14
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,680
Yes!

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,740
A policeman with thick eyebrows tied up with sandalwood!

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,940
It's definitely the person I heard from the viewers!

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,760
It's Mr. Omari, Ryo-tsu!

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,980
Are the traps okay?

19
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,640
Perfect!

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,660
I brought the fake

21
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,120
I saw it!

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,480
Good! Keep it as it is!

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,820
Huh?

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,520
I went too far

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,600
That's strange

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,760
Why didn't you pick up the fake?

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,940
There's no fake!

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
When did you...

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,920
No way!

30
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,460
Here it is!

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:14,960
Stop!

32
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,320
There's nothing suspicious

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,800
I'll play it slowly this time

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll play it slowly this time

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,220
I can't see anything unusual

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,100
Next, I'll try to send it in pieces

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,500
I'll try to send it in pieces

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,100
I'll try to send it in pieces

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,540
I'll try to send it in pieces

40
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,020
I'll try to send it in pieces

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,620
I'll try to send it in pieces

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:37,920
I'll try to send it in pieces

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,440
What?!

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,800
I can only see this one piece!

45
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,720
How fast!

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,420
It's not the time to be impressed!

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Hurry up and follow me!

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,320
Bring out the placard and take the final picture!

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,620
Hey!

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,920
Hey!

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
I found something good!

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,120
I got a reward from the God of the Placard!

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,520
That's right!

54
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,020
That's right!

55
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,740
That's right!

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,940
What a pain in the ass!

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
There's something good about living as a human

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,600
Thank you, God!

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,540
What are you doing, Ryo-san?

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,020
What is it, Terai-kun?

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
It looks fun

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,680
Did something good happen?

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,680
What are you talking about?

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,560
What a strange Terai-kun

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,600
Is that so?

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,020
Oh, that's right

67
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,540
Ryo-san, do you want to eat this?

68
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,880
What is this?

69
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,820
It's a small-sized fried pork

70
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,300
What?

71
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,220
It's a small-sized fried pork!

72
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,180
It's a bite-sized fried pork

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
So it's a small-sized fried pork

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,460
How about one?

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,300
What is this strange development?

76
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,640
I can't believe he knows about the small-sized fried pork

77
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,140
I'm sure the Terai still has the reward

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,160
I know it!

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,180
Give me the small-sized fried pork!

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
It doesn't fit in your hand!

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Even if you change it, it won't fit in your hand!

82
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,740
What?

83
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,160
Ryo-san, you are so strange

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,720
That was close

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,360
Although I'm his colleague, I'm not talking about money

86
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,600
I have to be careful

87
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,540
Who is looking at me?

88
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,360
Is it my imagination?

89
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,600
No, I feel it

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,640
I bet I'm a small-sized fried pork!

91
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,080
Small-sized?

92
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,400
Yes, a small-sized fried pork!

93
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,680
Small-sized?

94
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
Small-sized!

95
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,120
Small-sized is a big job!

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,240
Small-sized?

97
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,100
I want to do it!

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,460
Small-sized fried pork for a cat?

99
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,120
Don't tell me they are...

100
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,360
I can't believe it

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm rich anyway

102
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,840
Ouch!

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Alright, let's go to the Kimegose River!

104
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,400
Yes!

105
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,320
Too bad!

106
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,820
It was a surprise camera!

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,980
We made such a decisive moment

108
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,340
If we don't show this, the show will not end

109
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,240
Damn it!

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
We'll catch it no matter what!

111
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,480
Hurry up!

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,940
There it is!

113
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,260
I'll protect the small-sized fried pork!

114
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,200
There it is!

115
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,220
Too bad!

116
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,200
Was it a surprise?

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
Oh no!

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Damn it! Where did it go?

119
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,040
Over there!

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
Too bad!

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,640
Wait for me!

122
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,660
Where did it go?

123
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,980
Over there!

124
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,880
Alright, we can do this this time!

125
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,680
Then, let's go!

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,560
Too bad!

127
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,140
It was a surprise camera!

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,300
Go away!

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,520
OMG!

130
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,320
I can make it count!

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,320
Wait for me alright?

132
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,640
I'll give you this fried pork no matter what!!

133
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,460
We will give you a little something!

134
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,640
What?

135
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,080
So, you made a surprise film for Ryo-chan?

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Yes

137
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
I received a note from the audience

138
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,940
that said that there is a crazy...

139
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,960
No, no, no, a very unique police officer

140
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,480
I was wondering what would happen if I found a fake koban.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,060
I thought I'd film it, but Ryotsu-san took it away in a flash.

142
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,900
If I don't show this, the show won't end. Please catch him somehow.

143
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,620
But did Ryotsu really take away the koban?

144
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,000
Certainly he is an idiot, a mess, and a poor and poor police officer.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
But he was a cat, so he would have fallen.

146
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,340
Or maybe...

147
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,040
There's a definitive evidence.

148
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,720
This is it.

149
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,120
I expected it, but...

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,620
I can't believe he was really a cat.

151
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,100
Damn it, Ryotsu!

152
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,240
I'll make my heart empty, which I tried to believe just a little bit.

153
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go!

154
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,400
Where are you going?

155
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm looking forward to seeing where Ryotsu, who got the koban, is going.

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,760
He looks like he has given up on the people.

157
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Well, let's see if I can change the koban into money.

158
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,960
I have no choice.

159
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,860
Wait!

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
Hey, Ryotsu!

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,900
What are you doing here?

162
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,280
Nothing serious...

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,980
What do you need it for?

164
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,880
There was a kottouhin-ya here.

165
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,700
I didn't know about it.

166
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,920
I heard that there are some people who sell the food they picked up in the army.

167
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,420
Especially, there are those who pick up the bowls and try to sell them.

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,280
That's right. The chief is right.

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,660
Are you hiding something from me?

170
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,880
No, nothing at all.

171
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,720
If you apologize now, I won't forgive you.

172
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,240
What are you talking about? I don't mind.

173
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,300
Really? You really don't do anything.

174
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,120
Of course. I'm the one who is the most powerful and most wise.

175
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,180
Don't be stupid. I've already checked the bowls you picked up.

176
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,480
What?

177
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,640
Look.

178
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,960
That's too bad.

179
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,580
It's a surprise camera.

180
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,340
So, what are these bowls?

181
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,580
They are all fake.

182
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,520
Fake?

183
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes.

184
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,060
What? You're so mean.

185
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,180
You did a good job of making me fall for you.

186
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,460
You idiot.

187
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,960
You're the one who tried to make me fall for you.

188
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,960
And you were the one who was beaten to the end.

189
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,440
You won't forgive me today.

190
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,360
Ouch.

191
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,680
Shit. I'll run away as soon as I can.

192
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,280
Thank you.

193
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,340
I'll definitely get my score.

194
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,460
But...

195
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't think we should broadcast this.

196
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,180
What?

197
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,900
If this is broadcasted, the whole country will be ashamed of the book.

198
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,320
But we'll definitely get your score.

199
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,660
I'll put a mosaic on your face. It'll be fine.

200
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Excuse me.

201
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,220
Hello?

202
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,620
What?

203
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,260
What?

204
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,100
What?

205
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,220
No way.

206
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,080
What's wrong?

207
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,340
The bowls you brought are real.

208
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,620
What?

209
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,600
I was going to check them next week at the treasure inspection program.

210
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
I was going to check them next week at the treasure inspection program.

211
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,740
I was going to check them next week at the treasure inspection program.

212
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,640
But my phone just...

213
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,160
What?

214
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,060
What?

215
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,400
What?

216
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,820
Are these all fake?

217
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,040
If they're real, I'll...

218
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,820
Ryo.

219
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, it's you guys.

220
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,620
Hey, what's that?

221
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:52,880
This is...

222
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,200
Well, it's a fake of the bowl.

223
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,860
A fake of the bowl?

224
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,540
I'll do it because I want to.

225
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,220
Yay!

226
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,220
There you go.

227
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,780
Yay!

228
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,700
Wow!

229
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,280
Awesome!

230
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,500
That's great.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,180
All right, me too.

232
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,560
Wow, that's Ryo!

233
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,660
If you're going to do this, leave it to me.

234
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,620
If you're going to do this, leave it to me.

235
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,260
See?

236
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,180
All right.

237
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,380
Come on.

238
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,520
Hey!

239
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,840
Where did Ryo-tsu go?

240
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm not kidding! If we lose the real one, we're done for!

241
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,260
I don't want that! I still have my car loan!

242
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,140
I still have my house loan for 32 years!

243
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,920
Ouch! Ryo-tsu! Where's the one from before?!

244
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,500
Yaaah!

245
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,460
This is good. The old one is scraped and the gold powder comes out.

246
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,940
Ryo-tsu, that's...

247
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,420
Hey, it's a fake old one!

248
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,160
You can play with it even if it's fake!

249
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
If you give it to the kids, they'll be so happy!

250
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,640
N-no way! The old one you picked was the real one!

251
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,760
I don't want that, chief! Are you going to use the camera again?

252
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
I can't use it anymore!

253
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,740
No!

254
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,900
That's not real! It's genuine!

255
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,320
What? It's real? It's true!

256
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,540
The real one is worth $11,000,000!

257
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,360
Hold it!

258
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,640
What did he do?!

259
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,560
Good grief!

260
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,500
Stop it!

261
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
You idiot! You should reflect on yourself for a while!

262
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,200
No way! I'm not in the wrong!

263
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,460
The TV station people are the ones who made a mistake with the real thing!

264
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,080
Idiot! It's your fault that you got caught in the camera!

265
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
The fact that you made a mistake with the little board and the children...

266
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
It's all your fault!

267
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,020
No way!

268
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,980
I'm so embarrassed because of you today!

269
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,060
I never thought you would do something like that!

270
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,440
But I don't think there's anyone who would make a mistake with the little board!

271
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,380
So I thought it was a gift from God!

272
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,040
Idiot! You should rest!

273
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,760
I can't believe you got caught in the TV show!

274
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,780
You're the idiot who got caught in that kind of thing!

275
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,580
So you're saying that the director is not caught in the camera?

276
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,380
Of course!

277
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,860
A man who is always calm like me...

278
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,900
He's not like that!

279
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,860
He's not caught in such a obvious trick!

280
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,980
Unlike you!

281
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,080
Huh?

282
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,760
If you had acted with pride as a police officer like me...

283
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,560
You wouldn't have been so caught!

284
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,740
You'd better be careful!

285
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,160
I see. I understand, sir.

286
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,180
Welcome!

287
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,320
Hmm?

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,080
Hmm?

289
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,860
Huh?

290
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,700
Hey, is this pot also 500 yen?

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,580
This one?

292
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Well...

293
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm in trouble.

294
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,260
Grandpa hasn't come home yet.

295
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,720
Well, whatever.

296
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,100
Then, I'll take 500 yen.

297
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,060
Okay, here.

298
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,860
This is good.

299
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,660
Please wait, sir.

300
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,780
Good morning, everyone!

301
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,640
Good morning!

302
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,160
Ryo-chan hasn't come yet?

303
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,600
He's in trouble.

304
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,460
Good morning.

305
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,780
Thank you, sir.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,420
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,820
Please pass the bill.

308
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:48,880
Here you go.

309
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
What's that?

310
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,200
It's a pot I got from my grandpa in Tsukuda Island.

311
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,560
Here you go.

312
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,000
Hmm...

313
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,480
It's a strange pot.

314
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,260
Huh?

315
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,400
I knew you wouldn't take it seriously.

316
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,920
This pot is made in the Ming Dynasty.

317
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
It's a Chinese-style pot.

318
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,800
Oh, I see.

319
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,480
It doesn't look like it, though.

320
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,980
But why did you take it?

321
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,560
I was worried that I might be stolen if I leave it at home.

322
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,240
But if I leave it at home, I'm afraid I'll break it.

323
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,460
I see.

324
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,640
So, sir, would you like to take it?

325
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,600
What?

326
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,260
You mean me?

327
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,040
Anyway, you're a gentleman.

328
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,680
If you're as sharp-eyed as the chief, you know how valuable this pot is, right?

329
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,580
If you break a precious asset, both historically and culturally, I'm sorry, sir.

330
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,540
And this pot is as sharp-eyed as the chief.

331
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,680
I think it would be better if you were by my side.

332
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,580
I'm leaving it to you, sir!

333
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,460
I'll leave it to you!

334
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,580
Oh...

335
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,520
Ah...

336
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,680
It can't be helped to be told that.

337
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,900
I'll keep it at home.

338
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,560
Really?

339
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,680
Thank you!

340
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,400
The first step was successful.

341
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,740
Well then, everyone.

342
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,340
Thank you.

343
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,880
Thank you very much!

344
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh?

345
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,800
Who is it?

346
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,240
No matter how many times I look at it, it doesn't look like such an expensive pot.

347
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,220
Could it be that Ryotsu is trying to trick me?

348
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
What a surprise! This pot costs 1 billion yen!

349
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040
It's a wonderful pot!

350
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,020
It's the same as this pot!

351
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,040
This pot was made in the Ming Dynasty in China,

352
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,080
and it is said to be the only pot that the emperor used at that time.

353
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,880
Therefore, if it is in existence, it will cost 1 billion yen for sure.

354
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,100
1 billion yen?

355
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
1 billion yen.

356
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,520
This pot is 1 billion yen.

357
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,520
You!

358
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
You idiot!

359
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,480
Don't talk to me before you get in!

360
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,020
You idiot!

361
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,140
It's because a professional inspector said so, so there's no doubt.

363
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,520
This pot is real.

364
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,460
The second stage has succeeded.

365
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,840
Well then, I'm going.

366
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,560
Yes, have a good trip.

367
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,820
No way.

368
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,660
It's 1 billion yen.

369
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,900
N-no way.

370
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,900
What's wrong with you?

371
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,340
You!

372
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,960
Well then, I'm going.

373
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,780
Yes, have a good trip.

374
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,320
This is good.

375
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,220
No way.

376
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,840
I feel like everyone is aiming at this pot.

377
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,080
And so, my pot is...

378
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Pot?

379
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,120
Ah, pot, pot!

380
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:07,960
Pot?

381
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,220
Two buttons?

382
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:09,860
Pot!

383
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,820
Isn't it one button?

384
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,400
Pot.

385
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,740
Pot!

386
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,380
I thought that you would put it in a pot, so I took it out.

387
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,140
Why are you all looking at me?

388
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,780
Why!

389
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,380
Ryo-tsu, Ryo-tsu, are you there?

390
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,940
What's wrong, my daddy?

391
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,380
What's wrong or do you have to do this?

392
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,720
I couldn't hear the line "1 billion yen?

393
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,740
There are some suspicious people wandering around from the house, and I don't want

394
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,440
to be in touch with such ugly things.

395
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,940
I'll give it back, right now.

396
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,380
Give it back now.

397
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,000
No way.

398
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,800
I have no one to count on than the chief.

399
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,300
I believe that the chief will protect the pot no matter what happens.

400
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,300
I know that the chief is not a person who betrays his subordinates.

401
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,740
I know very well that he is not a person who breaks the promise of taking over once.

402
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,800
That's right. I will always keep my promise.

403
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,420
That's right, that's right, that's right.

404
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,920
As expected of the chief. No, the best in Japan, no, the best in the world.

405
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah ...

406
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,380
Ah, stupid!

407
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh! Ah, ah!

408
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,980
Emergency! Who put a banana peel in such a place?

409
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,800
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm a little hungry.

410
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,680
Ryotsu, you ...

411
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,720
No, no, no, I don't think I did it on purpose.

412
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,760
I can't do that.

413
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,700
If you get caught, you can't get a pension even if you pay one life.

414
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Ah, ah ...

415
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,060
I know.

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,580
The chief is taking good care of the old man on Tsukuda Island,

417
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
so I told him to rest assured.

418
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,160
Please take good care of him.

419
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,700
Yeah, you're so loud.

420
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,200
What's going on, Cheshirikun?

421
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,580
The pot! What's going on?

422
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,080
Alright, let's get out of here!

423
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,640
Hey, what are you doing?

424
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm asking you what you're doing!

425
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,380
You can tell by looking at me.

426
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm building a road.

427
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,880
That's why I'm asking you why you're building in front of the station.

428
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,540
Hey, there's a pot! A pot!

429
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,780
We're not allowed to build!

430
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,840
Move quickly!

431
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
You don't have to say that...

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,560
Hey, there's a pot again!

433
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,580
Anyway, don't build here!

434
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,760
Hey!

435
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:33,960
Hey, stop!

436
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,720
Hey, hello?

437
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,680
What?

438
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I made a mistake?

439
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,340
Yes, I understand.

440
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,580
I'm sorry.

441
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,120
I think I made a mistake.

442
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,720
Look at that.

443
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,740
If you understand, go away!

444
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,880
Yes, sir.

445
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,940
You've been chased quite a bit.

446
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,360
Now, it's time to finish.

447
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,920
Today was a rough day.

448
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,580
I'm in a bad mood these days.

449
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,380
Well, I guess you are still in a good mood.

450
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,180
I heard you were not able to beat it.

451
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,640
And I don't see what kind of world he has steps up his sleeve.

452
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,700
Okay, okay, bye, bye.

453
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,300
Siyu, what are you doing?

454
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,000
Hurry up!

455
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,460
Hurry up!

456
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,480
This is too much for me.

457
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,580
If it's a glue, then...

458
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,200
This should be the original.

459
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,140
Why are there some parts left?

460
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,780
I'm back! I'm back from the patrol!

461
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,740
Chief Oya, what are you doing here?

462
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,220
Oh, no, it's nothing...

463
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,920
Chief, what did you use the glue for?

464
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
Why is there glue here?

465
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,640
It seems that there are more adults who can't apologize for their mistakes these days.

466
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,980
Is that so? That's a good thing.

467
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,800
Especially the worst thing to do is to break things that people have taken from you and give them away.

468
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
That's right.

469
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I hope everyone is as honest and honest as the chief.

470
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,200
Chief, did you hide something from me?

471
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,640
No, I didn't.

472
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
If you want to apologize, you can do it now.

473
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,000
You can forgive me in private.

474
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,980
What are you talking about? I don't have to do it.

475
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,520
Really? You really didn't do anything?

476
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,380
Oh, no! The jar is broken!

477
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,740
I can't do this anymore!

478
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,860
My life is over!

479
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,760
Chief.

480
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,160
What?

481
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,400
Ta-da!

482
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,040
It's a great success!

483
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,120
It's a surprise camera!

484
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,320
What?

485
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,980
That's why it's a surprise camera!

486
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,960
The jar is all messy!

487
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
What? Then what is this jar?

488
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,140
It's a 500-yen jar that I bought for free.

489
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,900
So you're talking about 10 billion yen?

490
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,160
Yes! It's a video I made for that TV show.

491
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,000
The shadow around the house...

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,880
That's me, too.

493
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,720
The jar suddenly broke.

494
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,700
I broke it in advance and after a while I put it together with a detachable adhesive.

495
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
I see.

496
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,700
Is that so?

497
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,500
Yes, that's right.

498
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,980
Ryozu!

499
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,480
You're a...

500
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,160
Hey, hey, hey!

501
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
Why are you getting angry?

502
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
The chief said it's worse to get caught.

503
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,300
That's why you're doing too much!

504
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,360
No way!

505
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,300
Senior!

506
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,380
Hey, Nagagawa Reiko!

507
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,380
You sold me a jar, didn't you?

508
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,940
Yes, Ryo-chan.

509
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,660
It's a big deal.

510
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,480
The jar you bought was a big deal!

511
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm sorry.

512
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:51,860
What?

513
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,560
When I asked my grandpa, that jar wasn't for sale.

514
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,680
I bought it by mistake.

515
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,740
What? Is that so?

516
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,740
That's not all.

517
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,720
Actually, that jar...

518
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,100
What?

519
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,520
China has an illusionary jar from the Song Dynasty.

520
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,080
Apparently it will make 500 billion.

521
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:10,800
Huh?

522
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,280
500 billion?

523
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,500
That's right!

524
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,720
It's not just 100 billion, but 500 billion!

525
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,940
It's a high-class jar!

526
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,660
So where's the jar?

527
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,760
Where is that jar now?

528
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,780
Huh?

529
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,460
Huh?

530
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,580
The illusionary jar is 500 billion...

531
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,660
Please be patient!

532
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,400
Wait!

533
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,740
Hey!

534
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,500
Th-This is 500 billion?

535
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,060
Does that mean I've broken 500 billion by myself?

536
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,420
No way!

537
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,340
Nagagawa Reiko!

538
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
Unfortunately...

539
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,000
It's all true!

540
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,820
You're so selfish!

541
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,340
N-No way!

542
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,680
N-No way!

543
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,100
Somebody, tell me this is also a surprise camera!

574
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,340
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

575
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:00,700
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt on top of his eyes

576
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,120
Turn around and look at that corner

577
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,900
You can meet everyone

578
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,740
You can meet everyone

579
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,340
There is Kameari

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,780
There must be Kameari

581
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,440
Come to our town

582
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,500
Thank you!

583
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,740
Bonus season has come again this year!

584
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,220
After being chased by a group of shoppers, I escaped from Kameari before the deadline!

585
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
I can get money anywhere!

586
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,620
However, the village deep in the mountains was a terrible village where poor livestock rampaged!

587
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,360
Next time, Bonus Soudatsu 7!

588
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,540
Thank you!

589
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,800
There is Kameari

590
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,160
There must be Kameari

591
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,820
Come to our town

592
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you!
