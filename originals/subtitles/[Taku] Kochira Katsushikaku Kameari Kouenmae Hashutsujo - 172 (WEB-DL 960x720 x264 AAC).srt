1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,600
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,660
Make the room brighter and try to look away

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:25,080
It's after the rain that someone is calling

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,140
It's after the rain that someone is calling

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,300
I walked looking back

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,180
My mom was holding my hand

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,760
I felt that strange feeling at that time

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,400
So I tried to walk on the black tile of the Akegogai

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:55,020
I tried to walk on the black tile of the Akegogai

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,320
Everyone was a child once

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,660
But everyone forgets

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,200
The politician with a great face

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,740
And the blue lady above her eyes

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,180
Turn around and look at that corner

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,800
You can meet everyone

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,340
There is a wall there

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,600
There is a wall there

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,760
There is a wall there

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,900
Come, everyone

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,500
To our town

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,500
The day of strike at Hita Town

23
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,660
Deadly by a미

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,960
The whole body is covered in blood.

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,540
He looks like a wild animal.

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,920
Is he really a police officer?

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,620
He's the chief of the police, Kanagawa Ryotsu.

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,760
He comes to our station for temporary work.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,980
So the chief came to pick you up?

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,780
I met him at the east exit at 3:00, but he hasn't come yet.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,760
Then he might be waiting at the upper exit.

32
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,100
There are two exits at the east exit.

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,020
Can I take a look?

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,200
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,660
What's wrong with you?

36
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,520
Watch out! Stop him!

37
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,040
Run up the stairs!

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,120
Stop him, Taro!

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,660
Midori!

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
Shut up!

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,360
The police stopped him!

42
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,080
Watch out! Run up the stairs!

43
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,740
Sir, could it be...

44
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,660
He's an outsider, a wild animal, and a fool.

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,460
Then he's Ryotsu!

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,700
Ouch!

47
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,820
What a heavy cow!

48
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,040
Are you okay?

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,760
Ryotsu, let me treat your wound.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,900
It'll heal if you look at it.

51
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,360
Huh?

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,420
Who do you know my name?

53
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,780
Who?

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,260
The chief of the 5th exit of the lower house, Ban Isoroku.

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,740
I'm glad to see you. I'm Ryotsu. Nice to meet you.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,220
I was a good man as soon as I got here.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,420
If you're okay with the wound, I'll go now.

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,460
Huh? Isn't this the exit?

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah. I'll show you around, so follow me.

60
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,460
Okay.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,020
It seems that the land around here is bright.

62
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah, because my house is close.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,160
It used to be a playground.

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,120
By the way, what's that cow?

65
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,240
Tarou, who lives in a dry- béchic-terrain area.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,940
He lives in a dry- béchic-terrain area?

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,140
He's usually peaceful.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,620
No, I'm not talking about that.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,760
It's Ryo-san!

70
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,500
It's been a while.

71
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,640
That's your father. He looks healthy.

72
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,820
Only his health is important.

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,260
Are you his acquaintance?

74
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,820
My friend from junior high school.

75
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,620
I heard that Dagashiya was a great success in the hit-and-match boom.

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,000
That's not true.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,380
No problem. There are not many dagashi shops in Tokyo.

78
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,260
My neighbor stopped selling last year.

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,020
When I was in my early 30s, I used to come all the way from Tokyo to buy snacks in Nippori.

80
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,800
There were over 60 dagashi shops at that time. Now there are less than 10 of them.

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,420
I'm going to work hard and do business.

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,920
Cheer up, old man. I'll buy two bags of snacks.

83
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,520
I'll buy them all at the next book fair.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,700
I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

85
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,320
Is this the 5th and 8th store?

86
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes. It's like a museum.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,820
What are you doing?

88
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,660
Stop, Ryo-san. I asked for a towel.

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,100
For the dog?

90
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,280
Good job, Kanikichi.

91
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,320
You call that dog Kanikichi?

92
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,640
You're Kanikichi, too. Don't mind me. It's a coincidence.

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
Good job, everyone.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
Are there more?

95
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,860
Yes. From the end. Reiko, Keiichi and Daijiro.

96
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,500
They're the same as the kameyari.

97
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,040
Do you like animals?

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,260
Yes. As I picked up stray dogs, they grew up.

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,700
What? You picked them all up?

100
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,760
It's like a zoo.

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,540
Chief, did you pick up the children?

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Idiot. The children in the neighborhood came to play.

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,200
Then, Ryo-san will be in charge of feeding.

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,200
I knew it.

105
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,320
Who will feed us?

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,600
Don't worry about that.

107
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,180
Good evening, old man.

108
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,900
Tonight we'll have oden.

109
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,020
Please, if you like.

110
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,240
Mr. Tanaka, you're always so kind.

111
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,960
The children are always taking care of us.

112
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,500
With the Japanese sweets from the rabbit shop.

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,700
Hey, let's go home. Ichiro, Jiro.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Yes.

116
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,800
We always have a lot of things from the neighborhood.

117
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,920
I see.

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,540
Well, then, take care.

119
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,980
Bye-bye.

120
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,840
See you.

121
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,340
I used to be afraid of the court.

122
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,320
But now I'm not afraid of it.

123
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,160
In the court, the parents and children are safe.

124
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,480
Oh, no.

125
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,160
Mr. Gin and Mr. Segare.

126
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,800
The old lady from the shop in the middle.

127
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,300
Did you become Ueno's maid?

128
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,740
No. I'm here for a temporary job.

129
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,260
I see. I have to inform Mr. Gin immediately.

130
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,040
Hey, don't do unnecessary things.

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,280
I'll leave some for Monaka.

132
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,680
This is really delicious.

133
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,980
I'm not good at sweets.

134
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,980
I'm in trouble.

135
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
If you think about it, you have a lot of acquaintances.

136
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,700
In this area,

137
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,220
If you have a lot of acquaintances, you can't act poorly.

138
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,140
I was born the same way, and I have only acquaintances.

139
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,000
It feels like I'm working at home.

140
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,840
It's hard to do something.

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,600
Let's eat!

142
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,480
Why are they together?

143
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,240
It's better to have many meals.

144
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,600
That's not the problem.

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,500
Hey, that's mine.

146
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,880
Ryotsu, don't bully animals.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
I took my snack!

148
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,740
Then you should share Kankichi's dog food.

149
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm a human!

150
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,640
You're so stubborn.

151
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,980
There's no human who likes dog food!

152
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,620
This may be a bit awkward, but please bear with it.

153
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,520
It's fine if you can sleep in a good bed like this.

154
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,580
That's Kankichi's bed.

155
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,660
Sorry, but yours is this way.

156
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,500
You sleep in the same room as these guys?

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,840
Of course!

158
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,020
I'll wake you up when it's time to change.

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,620
What kind of station is this?

160
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,580
What?

161
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,960
Are you going to the station under Ueno to be hospitalized?

162
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,140
That's right.

163
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,440
Five of the six staff were hospitalized due to a cold.

164
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,420
They were hospitalized due to a cold.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
The police officer who never gets cold,

166
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,260
who knows the details of the Ueno area,

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,640
found out that you're the only one who can be hospitalized.

168
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,120
He's the selected dispatch officer.

169
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,140
He's amazing!

170
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,520
He's meeting with the head of the Daigo Expressway at the east exit of Nippori Station at 3:00 today.

171
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,440
What? Now?

172
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,160
That's right.

173
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,120
They say that a cute child should be knocked down by the former.

174
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,300
Let him travel!

175
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,860
What?

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

177
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,800
What's going on?

178
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
Ryotsu, it's time.

179
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,820
It's still dark.

180
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,580
It's time for the birds to eat at 5:00 in the morning.

181
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,080
I think I know why the officers were hospitalized.

182
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:23,220
What are you making, Ryotsu?

183
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,020
This is a hut for them.

184
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
A hut?

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,080
Do you want to lock them up in a place like this?

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,780
This is normal in the world.

187
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,860
The chief is too sweet for animals.

188
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,880
They can't survive through the 21st century.

189
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm going to take care of them.

190
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,920
What if the chief is hospitalized due to illness or injury?

191
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,580
What if he gets a stroke?

192
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,380
Nobody will take care of them.

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,520
That's...

194
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,120
On that day, I'm going to tell them

195
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,020
what it's like to be a normal pet.

196
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,140
I'm going to tell them what it's like to be a normal pet.

197
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,340
What about the way you've been walking?

198
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,540
I'm going to let the animals do it on their own.

199
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,460
That's why...

200
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,120
Look at the belly of the big bird.

201
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,020
It's a complete middle age.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,300
You don't know what it's like to be a diabetes.

203
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,320
I will train them thoroughly from today.

204
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,760
The middle age, huh?

205
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,180
It's been a long time.

206
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,780
When I was a kid, I used to have a lot of competition here.

207
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,580
What?

208
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey!

209
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,740
Don't be so weak for a dog.

210
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,800
Chief!

211
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,220
It's not easy.

212
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,560
You guys.

213
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,740
I can't talk to you.

214
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm so weak.

215
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,100
I don't have much stamina.

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,680
When we patrol,

217
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll take you with me for a walk.

218
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,500
Here's your meal.

219
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,980
From today on,

220
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,100
that's your bed.

221
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
Take your time.

222
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,600
I'll eat it.

223
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,260
How about I feed you a little more?

224
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,300
I've exercised today.

225
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,120
No!

226
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,880
They're just fat.

227
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,740
They're just fat.

228
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,920
I'll have to go on a diet.

229
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,040
Liu Zifeng,

230
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,040
it's time for their discharge.

231
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,220
What time is it? How long are you going to sleep?

232
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,680
Wake up!

233
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,840
Hey, you guys!

234
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,820
Ryotsu!

235
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,240
Hey, Ryotsu!

236
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,140
What the...

237
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,580
Why are you here?

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,040
You should have slept in the futon!

239
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,620
To be continued

240
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,860
Well, how ridiculous they are.

241
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,720
Speed has decrease.

242
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,060
Get more energy!

243
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,240
Hey!

244
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,120
Hey! Where are you going?

245
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,900
Damn. They are so disaster.

246
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,420
*panting*

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
*panting*

248
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,860
*panting*

249
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm back.

250
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,940
Hey, I've been waiting.

251
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,020
Do you know the escape route under the Yushima Tenshin?

252
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,560
Yeah, the one that stands at the intersection.

253
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,260
Yeah, sorry for coming back so late, but can you go return the gun to me?

254
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,820
You're like a servant to a child.

255
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,140
You two go with me. I'm going to lose weight.

256
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,200
*slurp*

257
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,840
There are many temples in Yanaka.

258
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,220
After all, the mountains of Ueno are not for the rich.

259
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
Oh, Ryo!

260
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,560
Huh?

261
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,800
Hey, Ichiro, Jiro!

262
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,760
I was going to go to the escape route, but I couldn't clear this game.

263
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm just going to use it for a while, so wait at the escape route.

264
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,660
Yeah!

265
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,060
You're Ryo, huh?

266
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,700
I thought you were.

267
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,340
Are you that famous?

268
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,940
I'm a three-faced man walking.

269
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm not a police officer.

270
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,860
There's no one I don't know here.

271
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,120
Here you go.

272
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,780
Thank you.

273
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,540
Oh, I got it.

274
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,500
It's just a little.

275
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,840
I'll gain some weight again.

276
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,160
*slurp*

277
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,540
This place is close to Shinobazu Lake.

278
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,960
It's a good environment.

279
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,340
I used to come here often as a child.

280
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
I came here many times at Yushima Tenshin.

281
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,280
It's a long slope when you go to Hongo.

282
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,000
There's a making shop near here.

283
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,460
I think it was around the beginning of the Showa era.

284
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,140
It was a time when cars were scarce and people carried luggage in the eighth car.

285
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,740
I picked up a sake bottle at this place in Sakashita and climbed up this Kirido Shizaka at once.

286
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,140
The eighth car's luggage is heavy, so I'm trying to show off my strength so I don't stop on the way.

287
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,260
I'm not sure if you know, but where were you born?

288
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,380
It's a prefectural clan.

289
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,900
It's right next to Yoshihara Daimon.

290
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Kanda Myojin is close, so it's good here.

291
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,500
Didn't you wear a miko-shi at the Kanda Festival?

292
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,440
I go to the Kanda Festival every time, but I feel like a man who always causes trouble.

293
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,060
Huh?

294
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,100
Oh, that's right.

295
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,940
Aren't you the police officer who always tries to catch me?

296
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,840
Yeah, that's a misunderstanding.

297
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,420
You sound like one.

298
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,860
I'm from Asakusa, so I only wear miko-shi when it's cold.

299
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,260
Well, I'm going home soon.

300
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,880
Wait a minute!

301
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,800
What?

302
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,480
What?

303
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,360
What is it?

304
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,960
Can you deliver this pot to the Hongo Toadai-mae Exhibition Room?

305
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

306
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,340
I have a job to go to Hongo.

307
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,900
I'll go up with you.

308
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,620
What's the matter with you guys?

309
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,360
You still don't have enough training.

310
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Huh?

311
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,940
Don't be so hard on yourself, Kankichi.

312
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,980
As expected of someone with the same name as me.

313
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,560
You're the one who's calling me the Toadai-mae of the Katsushika Office, aren't you?

314
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
I've heard a lot of rumors.

315
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,820
What kind of rumors?

316
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,200
A lot.

317
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,760
Like beating up the chief, or destroying the 20-car train.

318
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
That's what people say after all.

319
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,380
Are you home?

320
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,220
Huh?

321
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,720
He came to deliver the pot.

322
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,920
He's the toadai-mae of the Toadai-mae Exhibition Room.

323
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,680
Huh?

324
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,020
That famous...

325
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,800
The guy who set fire to the Exhibition Room.

326
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,160
You know him well.

327
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,980
No, I don't.

328
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,420
He was famous for destroying the main office.

329
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,100
That's the issue of the Katsushika Office.

330
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,740
He destroyed the main office...

331
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,580
Well, the main office.

332
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,860
We'll leave it at that.

333
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,740
Oh, right.

334
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
You seem to know a lot about the Chiri area.

335
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,100
It's like a garden.

336
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,780
When I was a kid, I used to fish in the Sanjiro Pond in the Toadai.

337
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,280
I used to run around the Yasuda Highland.

338
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,980
My employees are very fond of Chiri.

339
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,860
I have to learn it myself.

340
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,100
Do you know that there is an Exhibition Room on the slope of the Yayoi Crossroad?

341
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,760
Of course.

342
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,440
Go there to return the Sukiyaki pot.

343
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
We're going home anyway.

344
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,860
That's right.

345
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,000
The TV we borrowed from the southern Exhibition Room in Dangozaka, Sendagi...

346
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,620
Oh, that's right.

347
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,820
It's a little far, but it's a bicycle, so it's OK.

348
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,660
You mistook me for a delivery.

349
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,260
I'll give you four souvenirs.

350
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,200
All right, Machido.

351
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,740
You have to chill yourself and eat.

352
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,480
I know.

353
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,480
Thank you.

354
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,380
It's a little late, so I'm going to give them souvenirs.

355
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,020
You're going.

356
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,500
What can I do?

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,100
Maybe they're in here.

358
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,000
Drink this.

359
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,560
You'll feel better.

360
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,200
This is your first time at Lamune, isn't it?

361
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,040
I got it. I'll give you a drink.

362
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,860
When you're done, we'll leave.

363
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,820
You're late, Ryotsu.

364
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,520
We have to go to the meeting soon.

365
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,200
I can't help it.

366
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,420
I'll leave the rest to you.

367
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,900
The suspect is heading to the upper side of the road.

368
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,100
The suspect is heading to the upper side of the road.

369
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,200
Damn it!

370
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,340
What? Why is there a cow?

371
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,840
What's with this sound?

372
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,180
It's a cow!

373
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,700
It's over here!

374
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,480
The identity card is here.

375
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,480
Yes.

376
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,500
The suspect is heading to the 5th exhaust of Kitaya.

377
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
That's your exhaust.

378
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,660
...

379
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,680
W-Wait, what should we do? What's the situation?

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,540
The culprit is asking for a helicopter for escape.

381
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,860
If he doesn't obey, he'll get the children injured.

382
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,460
This is bad. We should have returned the children to our house first.

383
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,420
What's with this fuss?

384
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,800
Senpai!

385
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,440
Ryo!

386
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,240
Why are you here?

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,080
The culprit who attacked the bank with a turtle is running away.

388
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,260
He's holding the children hostage in the exit.

389
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,640
What? Then Ichiro and Jiro are...

390
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
They're being taken hostage.

391
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,640
What's going on?

392
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,940
Are you ready?

393
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,820
We're ready. Just wait a little longer.

394
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,560
If we don't hurry, the kids won't know what's going on.

395
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,980
Ichiro! Jiro! Someone, save them!

396
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,160
Okay, I'll hurry.

397
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,880
They were waiting for me.

398
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,420
Huh?

399
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,100
Huh?

400
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,760
Huh?

401
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Tabards?

402
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,180
Where?

403
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,400
This is terrible.

404
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
There's a monitor!

405
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:24,660
You can't run away.

406
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:24,820
This is where...

407
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,240
I didn't know there was such a place.

408
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,080
This is the area.

409
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,980
Take the car up to the exit.

410
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't stop the engine.

411
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,680
No matter what, the host's life is the most important thing.

412
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,800
I can't let them escape like this.

413
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,840
Don't tell me you guys...

414
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,940
I got it.

415
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,740
Hey, stand up!

416
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,560
Who's there?!

417
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,700
What is it? A dog?

418
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't make me laugh!

419
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:12,940
Oh no!

420
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,340
Are you alright, Ichiro, Jiro?

421
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,040
Ryo!

422
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,680
Don't let them escape!

423
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:26,920
Ryo!

424
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,520
Yes!

425
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,480
Oh no!

426
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,760
Hey!

427
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,300
Who's there?!

428
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,440
Taro, it's Nakagawa.

429
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:53,040
Thank you, Kankichi.

430
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,800
Hey.

431
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,160
1 hour later

432
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,800
It was a short time, but...

433
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,060
1 hour later

434
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,760
Thank you very much.

435
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,140
I had a lot of fun.

436
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,700
You guys should join us.

437
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
Senpai, it's about time.

438
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,460
Yeah.

439
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,520
Well then, excuse me.

440
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,800
How was your work in your hometown, senpai?

441
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,560
Yeah.

442
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,380
I've been going to many places now.

443
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,800
I'll try to go home now.

444
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,000
You can call me here.

445
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,460
Thanks, senpai.

446
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:48,840
Do you still think about my mother?

447
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm aware of that.

448
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,180
I'm sure she'll be happy to get a son.

449
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,780
I wish I could have a wonderful son.

450
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,780
But, it's my fault.

451
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,540
Even if we are separated

452
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,340
Didn't it hurt a little more?

453
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm sorry for that smelly animal.

454
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,320
Kankichi!

455
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,080
Kankichi!

456
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,100
Kankichi!

457
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,000
Take care! I'll come back again!

458
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,920
Senpai...

459
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,500
Let's go back! Kami-Ani is waiting for me!

460
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,280
Yes!

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,620
What?

487
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,880
You're going to battle at Ganryu-yama?

488
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,820
Interesting!

489
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,780
