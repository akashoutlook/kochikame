Are you sure you forgot all that?

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,420
Yes.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,140
Yes.

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,620
I already told you so much!

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,660
Ugh! I'm so tired!

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,400
Boss, stay still!

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,920
You're getting better blood pressure again.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,200
I just said that.

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
What did you say?

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,400
I was kidding!

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,040
Boss!

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,660
What's wrong?

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,340
I'm sorry! Medicine and water.

44
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,300
Here!

45
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,520
Hmm.

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,380
Ryo-chan, what did you forget?

47
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,100
-What did you say? -The resident's report.

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,320
The resident's report?

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,580
In the resident's report, only Ryotsu didn't submit the resident's report.

50
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,780
He said he would bring it a month ago.

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,660
A month ago?

52
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,140
What's wrong with you guys?

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,680
Chief, I'll bring it tomorrow.

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,660
Really?

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,180
Yes, I've been forgetting things lately, but I'll bring it tomorrow.

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,060
A man, Ryotsu Kankiji, doesn't have a second word.

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,040
Not just a second word, but a third or a fourth word.

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,080
What are you talking about? I'll definitely bring it tomorrow!

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,360
Ryo.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Huh?

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,440
What's wrong?

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,020
Can I talk to you?

63
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,780
Sure.

64
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,340
I bought the pre-sale of the Naitakeba four days ago, but then I had an urgent job and went to the countryside.

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,980
I came home last night.

66
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,080
I thought you might know the results.

67
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,840
Oh, I see.

68
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,720
Which race is it?

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,700
I'll ask you for the 10th race.

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,420
The 10th race is where the number 8 Bakunyu Gal ran away and became Manpa-gen.

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,020
Is that so?

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,200
Really?

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,760
I bought it at the store.

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,480
What about the second one?

75
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,660
It's the father gag order that Horiguchi, who came to chase me, took.

76
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,760
It's 82 and it's 18,000 yen.

77
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,080
Oh, is that so?

78
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,560
Yeah, by the way, I took 10,000 yen.

79
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,140
Oh, really?

80
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,640
It's 1.8 million yen.

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,320
Well, yeah.

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,740
Then, what about the 11th race?

83
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,460
Yeah, the main race is...

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,720
Ryo, I remember the result.

85
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,500
I'll ask you for the results of the main race again.

86
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,860
See you.

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
What a weird guy.

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,320
I want to do some work.

89
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,800
I want to do some work.

90
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Ryotsu, where's the sense of forgetting?

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
You can forget about me right away.

92
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,960
What does that mean that you remember the result of the race perfectly?

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,220
Chief.

94
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,980
Chief, why don't you take a break?

95
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,220
That's right.

96
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,420
Ryo, if you forget the census tomorrow, you'll be fired.

97
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,260
Yes, it's fine.

98
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,540
Look after yourself.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,360
Over there.

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,080
Mrs.

101
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,440
I'm glad that I could make a cup ramen with a pachinko.

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,220
It's really helpful when you don't have money.

103
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,900
Boss, are you done?

104
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,780
Yeah, it's much better.

105
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Boss, what do you want for lunch?

106
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,220
We're thinking of going to a new restaurant on the third floor.

107
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,200
I think it's better to make soba today, so I'll take it.

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,440
How about you, senior?

109
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,740
I want cup ramen.

110
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,200
You're pretty shy.

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,520
Thank you very much.

112
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,440
I don't have to ask rich people like you for a meal.

113
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,640
But you got a loan four or five days ago.

114
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,540
Yeah, it's about 1.8 million yen.

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Yeah, it's all a bar if you have four days.

116
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,300
Only four days?

117
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,640
Where are the rich people?

118
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,960
But today...

119
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,020
Reiko, I forgot that today is my payday.

120
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,900
I guess so.

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,180
Right.

122
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,200
If you tell him, he'll use it all up.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,940
You can keep quiet until you remember for him.

124
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Yes, sir.

125
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,720
Thank you for your hard work.

126
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,320
Thank you for your hard work.

127
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh, you're getting married. Congratulations.

128
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,980
Yes, Mr. Ohara.

129
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,460
Mr. Manager.

130
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm glad I made it in time.

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
What can I get you?

132
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,420
Can you give this to Ryotsu?

133
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,020
It's a salary bag.

134
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,800
I was going to deposit Ryotsu's salary, but I couldn't because the account was gone.

135
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,900
It can't be helped.

136
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,120
I see.

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
I'll give it to him.

138
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,460
By the way, I need proof that he received it.

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,960
Please tell him that I'll bring the money tomorrow.

140
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,160
Yes, sir.

141
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,920
Oh, Mr. Manager.

142
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,060
Ryo, it's a phone call.

143
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,020
Hello.

144
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,180
I'm already out of time. What's up?

145
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,700
Shut up.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,720
You're always out of time.

147
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,440
Don't talk about the past.

148
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,140
Mr. Manager, if you get too excited, you'll lose your blood vessels.

149
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,280
Shut up.

150
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,180
Tomorrow, bring me a bank note in addition to the resident's card.

151
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
A bank note?

152
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,560
Why is it a bank note?

153
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,580
It's important to you.

154
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,900
Don't forget it.

155
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,920
You're such a good boy.

156
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,040
It was a good night.

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,260
Father, I'll make you a beer.

158
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,660
Sure.

159
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,200
Here you are.

160
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,900
Thank you for your hard work today.

161
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
Thank you.

162
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,240
After all, beer after sunset is delicious.

163
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,280
Father, you really look delicious.

164
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,320
No, the beer I drink at my mother's house is special.

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,880
Father, you're just...

166
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,220
What's wrong?

167
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,540
I feel like I've forgotten something important.

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,720
Oh, no, father.

169
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't you have a lot of things to forget these days?

170
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,660
No, it's not that.

171
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,380
It's not Ryotsu.

172
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, right.

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,980
It's probably Ryotsu.

174
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,240
Yay, it's Ryotsu!

175
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,500
Why do I have to remember such a guy until I get home?

176
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,660
The beer is getting worse.

177
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,800
You can't remember it, so it's not a big deal.

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,620
Yeah, I remember it well in the bathroom.

179
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,840
Okay.

180
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:32,920
Okay.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll go to the bathroom again and remember it.

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,320
Huh?

183
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,400
Are you okay even though you drank beer?

184
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
I'm okay.

185
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,500
You're too serious.

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Ryo, that is to say, money, money.

187
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,420
Oh, I remember.

188
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,660
It's a salary bag.

189
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,860
Damn it.

190
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,180
I'm going to make a great feeling.

191
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm going to make a great feeling.

192
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,760
I'm going to make a great feeling.

193
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,660
I'm going to make a great feeling.

194
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,620
I'm going to make a great feeling.

195
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm going to make a great feeling.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,140
It's a very small bag.

197
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,740
Is that so?

198
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,480
You can eat ramen well in the morning.

199
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,240
Moreover, I've been eating three meals a day for a week.

200
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Shut up.

201
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,280
It's the day before the holiday, so it can't be helped.

202
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,240
What are you talking about?

203
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,980
Don't come out of there suddenly.

204
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,640
Ouch!

205
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,820
Ouch!

206
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,320
What a man who's been so nosy since morning.

207
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
Senior, are you alright?

208
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,440
Ryotsu, did you bring your residence card?

209
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,220
No, I'm sorry. I forgot again.

210
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Then where's your passport?

211
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,760
Passport? It's my first time hearing it.

212
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,160
You called me yesterday afternoon, right?

213
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,560
Was I?

214
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,280
Why do you always forget things like that?

215
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,740
I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll definitely...

216
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,260
Wait.

217
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
I'll write it on paper so don't forget.

218
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,860
But it's about Ryo-chan, so I'm going to lose my hair.

219
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,960
Oh, I see.

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
It's okay. I'll never lose it.

221
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,480
I can trust you.

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,640
No way.

223
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,800
That's right.

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,560
What?

225
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,360
Stay still.

226
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,180
What are you doing? Please stop.

227
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,400
Shut up and stay still.

228
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,780
It hurts. It hurts.

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,860
Alright, that's enough.

230
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,900
What are you doing?

231
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,400
What are you doing?

232
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,380
There's a staircase like this.

233
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,340
But I wonder if there's a mirror in Ryo-chan's room.

234
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,880
Even if there is, I don't think he'll see it.

235
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,020
Oh, is that so?

236
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,760
Alright, I'll write it here too.

237
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,820
This is good.

238
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,420
If you wash it in the bath, it'll fall.

239
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,220
It's okay. I won't go to the bath for about a week.

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,140
I see.

241
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,800
Shut up. Leave it alone.

242
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm still worried.

243
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,540
That's right. This is the forget-me-not prevention machine.

244
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,920
What machine is this?

245
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,220
My granddaughter made it in kindergarten.

246
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,120
I'll lend it to you. Use it well.

247
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,980
What?

248
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,520
I don't want to use such an important thing.

249
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,580
Don't say that.

250
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,120
Write down things you might forget.

251
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,400
If you check them one by one, you can press them.

252
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,320
If you press all of them, you won't forget anything.

253
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,840
It's easy, right?

254
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,880
It's a perfect machine for you.

255
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,780
I see.

256
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,300
You can change the place where the handkerchief is written into a bank account or a resident's card.

257
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,560
What? I see.

258
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,100
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

259
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,060
Huh? What?

260
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,020
Chief, what's wrong?

261
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,320
I think there's something important today.

262
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,420
Look. You forgot, too.

263
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
If you're asking me, I'll lend you this machine.

264
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,220
Shut up! Don't do that with you.

265
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,440
Mine is just a forget-me-not.

266
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,120
I remember when I entered the waste disposal.

267
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,180
Then, we can do the same thing when we entered the waste disposal.

268
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,760
That's right.

269
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,300
It might help you to remember.

270
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,140
Maybe it will bring back memories.

271
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,440
By the way, I remembered that yesterday.

272
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,900
Then let's recreate it.

273
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,920
I think I was putting out a map from the beginning.

274
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,540
I was carrying tea, and Ryo-chan was eating cup ramen.

275
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,840
Hey, do you want to eat again?

276
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,560
You can't do it in the same situation.

277
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,500
I'll make it. Ryo-chan, get on your seat.

278
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,620
Good grief.

279
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,240
Ready.

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Then let's start.

281
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,140
Good.

282
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,620
I can eat ramen from the morning.

283
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,820
You said you can eat it.

284
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,140
Ryo-chan, don't forget the play.

285
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,360
I got it.

286
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,980
When I came to this position, Ryo-chan put out ramen.

287
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,860
Senpai, please put it out.

288
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,080
Can you put it out so easily?

289
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,720
Ryo-chan.

290
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,820
Yes.

291
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,320
If you put this much pepper in it, you can put it out.

292
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,920
Remember, Ryo-chan.

293
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Then, once again.

294
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,560
You can eat it if you eat it.

295
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm going to be happy.

296
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,820
Wow!

297
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,020
Due to the color, this is wrong.

298
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,380
Why?

299
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,160
Oooh.

300
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,440
Ryo, you can't eat it.

301
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,600
Ryo-chan, just ...

302
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You can only eat soup.

303
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
I don't want to eat it.

304
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,380
No!

305
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,600
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

306
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,900
Congratulations!

307
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
That's great, Chief.

308
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,240
So, what is it?

309
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,420
Actually...

310
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,040
You guys are just wasting your time!

311
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,520
Ryo-tsu!

312
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,840
Huh?

313
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,840
Actually, I got your salary from the Manager yesterday.

314
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,900
Salary?

315
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,220
Yes.

316
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,520
Salary?

317
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,600
It was yesterday!

318
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,440
He's still thinking about it.

319
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,720
What an idiot.

320
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,440
Ryo!

321
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,800
Please give me back my salary, Chief!

322
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:48,980
Ryo!

323
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,660
Okay!

324
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,040
Don't be so excited.

325
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll give it to you now.

326
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,280
Don't be so impatient.

327
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,380
Huh?

328
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,100
N-No!

329
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,100
It was there before I arrived at the office!

330
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,960
Chief, what's wrong?

331
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,300
Please give me my salary!

332
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,940
Oh...

333
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,120
I have a lot of money I want to give you,

334
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,620
but I need a bank account as proof of receiving it.

335
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,600
So you said it was a bank account.

336
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,400
Uh, yeah.

337
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,320
Okay, I'll bring it right away!

338
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,020
Oh no...

339
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,400
What should I do?

340
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,180
Salary! Salary!

341
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh, it was in my book.

342
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,540
Oh, right.

343
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,420
It might be my pocket.

344
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,380
I just remembered something.

345
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I'll go to the office, so please take care of it.

346
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,460
Okay.

347
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,860
Chief, what's the matter?

348
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,580
I don't know.

349
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm sorry.

350
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,400
I'll call you back.

351
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,680
It's nothing...

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,140
It's nothing...

353
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,820
It's nothing...

354
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,280
Uh...

355
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,820
It's nothing...

356
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,120
So I dropped it when I went to the office.

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,060
Oh, right.

358
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,920
I'll ask the time check.

359
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,700
Chief!

360
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,720
That was pretty quick.

361
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,560
Would you like to have lunch with me?

362
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,180
More importantly, your salary!

363
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,800
We're not good friends, Ryo!

364
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,560
I'm going to eat eel because I'm angry.

365
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,240
Didn't you eat soba because you were sick?

366
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,620
No, I'm already healed.

367
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,900
I'm suspicious.

368
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,800
When the chief suddenly becomes kind, he always has something in mind.

369
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,940
What are you talking about?

370
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,860
I invited you because I saw you eating ramen every day.

371
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,580
I eat ramen every month before my payday.

372
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,400
Sometimes it was only water.

373
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,580
But the chief once...

374
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,580
What are you talking about?

375
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,740
I'm inviting you because I'm aware of your health.

376
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Let's go.

377
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,620
Have you decided your order?

378
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,200
Eel Nami.

379
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I want to eat special.

380
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,460
What?

381
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,400
If you don't want to, you don't have to pay.

382
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,940
I'll pay from my salary.

383
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,220
Please pay.

384
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,460
I didn't say it because I didn't want to treat you.

385
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,260
I ate ramen so much that it was a mess.

386
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,200
I just thought it would be just right.

387
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,320
What's your order?

388
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,780
One special eel and ramen.

389
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,580
I understand.

390
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,580
It was a big treat.

391
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,700
It's more suspicious.

392
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,040
It's good to be luxurious sometimes.

393
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,020
Did he use my salary?

394
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,680
No, the chief is only serious.

395
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,980
Then, did you forget your salary bag at home?

396
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,300
Did you drop it?

397
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,020
What are you talking about?

398
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,740
Did you see my face?

399
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,320
No, the chief has got wrinkles lately and has gotten old.

400
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,220
If you have a subordinate like you, you can get older by hard work.

401
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,880
I think so.

402
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,340
But if you get old, you'll have many forgotten things and dropped things.

403
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,480
What are you talking about?

404
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,380
It's not like that.

405
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,060
Thank you for waiting.

406
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,000
You're welcome.

407
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,600
Let's eat.

408
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,640
Let's eat.

409
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,740
Yeah, let's eat.

410
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,100
It looks like a pot.

411
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,460
Thank you for the meal, sir.

412
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,660
Look, there's a cafe here.

413
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,680
I want to drink coffee.

414
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,760
I don't need it.

415
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,640
Oh, really?

416
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Then I'll drink it by myself.

417
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,980
Please pay me, sir.

418
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,160
Oh, I want to drink coffee, too.

419
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,400
I want to drink coffee.

420
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,980
There's no doubt about it.

421
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,320
Two Blue Mountains, the most expensive.

422
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,060
I'll have a blend.

423
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,560
I'll treat you, sir.

424
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
Two Blue Mountains, please.

425
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,020
Yes, sir.

426
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,700
I realized I don't have a salary.

427
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,440
Sir.

428
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,160
Oh, Reiko.

429
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,820
Sir.

430
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,280
Hey, didn't you have a meal at a new restaurant today?

431
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,200
I was in a hurry, so I gave up.

432
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
That's too bad.

433
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,720
Okay, I'll pay you for this.

434
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,340
What?

435
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,800
What are you surprised about?

436
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm taking care of them every day, so I have to pay you sometimes as a senior.

437
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,240
It's kind of creepy.

438
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,640
I'm afraid of the consequences, so I'll hold back.

439
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,320
It's okay, it's okay.

440
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,100
I'll accept your kindness.

441
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,840
Then, sir, please pay me for my salary.

442
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,660
I'll pay you for this.

443
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,260
I'll pay you for this.

444
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,740
I'll pay you for this.

445
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,780
I'll pay you for this.

446
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,440
It's too bad.

447
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,360
That's it.

448
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,680
Reiko, Nakagawa, I'll treat you to a Blue Mountain, too.

449
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,200
Don't hold back and enjoy it.

450
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,380
I'll pay you for the pay, but I'll definitely ask for your rent.

451
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,640
You don't have my salary, do you?

452
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,700
What are you saying?

453
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,080
I've got it.

454
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,680
What, what's this confident attitude?

455
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,780
Damn it.

456
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,000
I got it.

457
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,340
I did. Then please give me the pay.

458
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,140
I will. If you want to buy something, write down the price, the reason and the reason in the form.

459
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,000
Then I will give it to you.

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,060
What are you talking about?

461
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,600
Why do you have to do that?

462
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,100
From today, I will take care of your pay.

463
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,820
This is not a joke.

464
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,460
Shut up.

465
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,640
It's bad that you lost your account.

466
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,540
If I manage it, the balance of the account will be zero on the payment date of public funds.

467
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,260
That's a good idea.

468
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,800
If the director manages it, we can also save money.

469
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Don't say unnecessary things.

470
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,700
Damn it.

471
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,120
I did it. I'm done.

472
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,360
This is what I want now.

473
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,440
Which one?

474
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,280
The engine of the Radicon plane is 20,000 yen.

475
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,620
The Pachinko is 50,000 yen.

476
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,060
The

477
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,080
No. I can't accept this.

478
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,100
What are you doing?

479
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,540
Buy something that will be useful to you.

480
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,300
Let's start over.

481
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,260
If you write it properly, I will give you all the money.

482
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,020
Then please.

483
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
This time, I wrote it properly.

484
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,040
Yes, that's it.

485
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,160
Bentsu, the apartment, the land.

486
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,900
What are you thinking?

487
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,060
You're thinking about something that will be useful for the future.

488
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,880
Where do you get 32 million yen?

489
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
It's a pre-paid salary.

490
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,860
Until about 10 years later.

491
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,620
Don't mess with me.

492
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,200
Make it useful for your life.

493
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,860
Damn it.

494
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,660
Okay.

495
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,200
What?

496
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,380
I've rewritten it.

497
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,020
Is it this much?

498
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,440
It's just a stupid thing.

499
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,440
It's a sacred book.

500
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,860
What are you going to do?

501
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,100
Of course, I'm going to read it.

502
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,080
Liar!

503
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,540
You can't read it.

504
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,040
That's a prejudice.

505
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,500
There are no prejudices in Shimura or Takakura prefecture.

506
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,920
Please calm down, director.

507
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,860
It's a pity to judge by appearance.

508
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,000
That's right.

509
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,640
If it's a sacred book, I don't think it will be lost.

510
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
You're a smart guy.

511
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,580
What is this Amida Nyorai?

512
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm interested in the heart of the Buddha.

513
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,300
Please tell me.

514
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,400
There is no God.

515
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,100
There is no God.

516
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,540
I believe in the Buddha.

517
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,920
Anyway, it's expensive.

518
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,620
What?

519
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,300
8,000 yen for three times?

520
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,400
The contents of the head are about 30 yen.

521
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,520
Isn't it too expensive?

522
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,400
I want to buy it from a charismatic user.

523
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,560
What's charismatic?

524
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,960
Your head is enough for my barricade.

525
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,540
This is no good.

526
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,400
This is no good.

527
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,320
This is no good.

528
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,140
This is no good.

529
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,460
I've seen everything.

530
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,520
Bring it over there.

531
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
Everything is okay.

532
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,260
Don't say stupid things.

533
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,020
This is all I can admit.

534
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,340
What?

535
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,560
Take it.

536
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,760
What is this?

537
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,880
This is the amount I've paid.

538
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,680
I can't buy a sacred book with this.

539
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,560
I won't read it anyway.

540
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,280
Look for it in an old bookstore.

541
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,900
It costs about 200,000 yen.

542
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,040
Buy it with your personal plastic model.

543
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
There is no plastic model for Amida Nyorai.

544
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,360
You must do it yourself.

545
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:06,960
That's all.

546
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm in school.

547
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,920
What can I do with 1000 yen now?

548
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm saying that I'm going to complain.

549
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,360
If you ask me, it's because of this bank.

550
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,340
I'm going to complain.

551
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,500
Recommendation of the general course?

552
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,440
Oh, dear.

553
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,200
Today's the end of the day.

554
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,280
Gyo-tsu!

555
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,980
Mujo!

556
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,620
What's this, Soudou?

557
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,480
Did you buy the Bible?

558
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,340
More importantly, look at this.

559
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,580
Recommendation of the general course?

560
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,940
If you join the general course, you can get a monthly deposit.

561
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,160
And if you don't have a public budget, you can get a refund from the deposit.

562
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,260
That's convenient.

563
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm joining the general course.

564
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,120
So you don't have to manage the club.

565
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,580
Oh, I see.

566
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,540
Gyo-tsu, let's have a drink tonight.

567
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,180
That's fine.

568
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,460
Gyo-tsu, let's have a drink tonight.

569
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,980
Don't say harsh things.

570
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,600
Let's talk slowly.

571
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Gyo-tsu, let's have a drink tonight.

572
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,860
Something happened today.

573
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,040
How about sushi?

574
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,200
Gyo-tsu, let's have a drink tonight.

575
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,180
Don't say harsh things.

576
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,260
Gyo-tsu, let's have a drink tonight.

577
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:23,540
Don't say harsh things.

578
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,260
Senpai.

579
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,740
Hey, Honda.

580
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,400
Hey, Honda.

581
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
What's wrong, Chief Ohara?

582
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm asking for your help.

583
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,360
No, I have to be considerate of my subordinates.

584
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,760
You're a good guy.

585
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,300
I'm saying that I'm going to hold back, but you don't listen.

586
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,640
I don't listen.

587
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,540
Senpai, are you going to hold back?

588
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh, right.

589
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,860
Senpai, you can't do that.

590
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,720
You'll forget your important pay bag.

591
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,340
What?

592
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,480
My pay bag?

593
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,880
My pay bag?

594
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,820
Gyo-tsu, you're wrong.

595
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:50,940
Gyo-tsu, you're wrong.

596
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,120
Gyo-tsu, you're wrong.

597
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,220
Why do you have my pay bag?

598
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,060
I was told that I can deliver it to you.

599
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,100
Your staff?

600
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,340
Yes.

601
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,920
I heard that it was on the table in the locker room this morning.

602
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,300
The table in the locker room?

603
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,500
On the table?

604
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,240
Yes.

605
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,180
I took out my pay bag in the locker room this morning, put it next to my bag, and changed it.

606
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,020
Oh, I forgot to put it on the table.

607
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,740
Gyo-tsu.

608
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,540
I used your pay for the research experiment of the rate of recovery of the raw materials in the book.

609
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,200
After all, my staff was honest.

610
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,560
Oh, good.

611
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,180
I think it's just a forgotten item.

612
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,600
Gyo-tsu, what are you talking about?

613
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,620
What?

614
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,180
Gyo-tsu.

615
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,200
It's kind of dangerous.

616
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,400
You two should use this.

617
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,260
Really.

618
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,480
What is this?

619
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,800
Well, see you tomorrow.

620
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,140
Chief!

621
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,400
Chief!

622
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,580
What happened to Sushi and Sake!

623
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,280
Because the pay is back, live alone!

624
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,480
Until you pay us, we will chase you to the end of the earth!

625
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,700
Are you been waiting for the end of the earth?

626
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,080
Dashi Dashi Dashi

627
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,060
I'm going to get my eyebrows done

628
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,260
and then I'll be on my way to the station

629
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,820

and then I'll be on my way to the station

632
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,420
I'll sleep on my dad's back

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
I'll sleep on my dad's back

I'll sleep on my dad's back

I'll sleep on my dad's back

I'll sleep on my dad's back

It's これからの I'm going to get my eyebrows done

641

I have no problem every day!

653
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,640
My heart is beating!

654

Monday!

655

Monday! Monday!

656

No problem!

657
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,420
You want me to monitor your new toys?

658
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,460
What's this?

659
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,060
A hero transformation set?

660
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,260
What? What?

661
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,860
You can react to voices and pose?

662
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh, this sounds fun!

663
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,340
Hey, everyone!
