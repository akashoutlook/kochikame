00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,100
Please turn on captions for the sake of the video.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,420
Please turn on subtitles for the sake of the video.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,440
When you're watching TV, make the room bright and look away.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to me if you don't have money.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,440
I don't have any money, but I worry.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,980
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,080
I wonder what will happen in the meantime.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:57,820
Come to me if you don't have any work.

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,940
Come to me.

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,060
I don't have any money, but I worry.

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,920
Look at the red cloud burning.

12
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,600
I wonder what will happen in the meantime.

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,540
Come to me if you don't have any work.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,540
Come to me if you don't have any work.

15
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,740
See you at dawn.

16
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,580
I know you don't have any work, but I worry.

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,460
I don't have any work, but I worry.

18
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,520
The sky is blue and the sun is shining.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,720
I know nothing happened on this day.

20
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,260
I don't know what you have done on this day.

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,940
There's nothing to be ashamed.

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,980
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,540
"Hara-heeey!"

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,060
"Drink some water and let that Harana-mushi stay quiet, you idiot!"

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,500
"Ah, sir!"

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
"Good morning!"

27
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,900
"Good morning."

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,900
"Sir..."

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,100
"I don't know anything!"

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,660
"Huh?"

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,880
"You're telling me to use my salary as a marketer and to borrow money from you, right?"

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,180
"Amazing! I'm seeing through everything!"

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,580
"As expected of you, sir."

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,940
"Huh! Everything is written on your face, you idiot!"

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,440
"Idiot..."

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,720
"Ah, that's right! Listen, Ryotsu!"

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,740
"With the salary you're receiving as a police officer, you should be able to eat enough!"

38
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,900
"Don't just do your job and spend money on stupid things, and save it!"

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,400
"You're asking me what I'm going to use my money for, right? That's too much!"

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,100
"That's no use!"

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,720
"I'm hungry, I'm hungry..."

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,360
"I'm hungry, I'm hungry..."

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
"Aah! It's the blessing of God!"

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,220
"Wait, wait, sir."

45
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:08,980
"Huh?"

46
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,560
"I dropped it, you know."

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,300
"What?!"

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
"I can't help it..."

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,480
"Ugh..."

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,780
"Oh, you're hungry?"

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,460
"Uh, yeah..."

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
"Then come over here!"

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,300
"Huh?"

54
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,140
"Huh?"

55
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
"Huh?"

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,300
"Huh?!"

57
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,140
"Huh?!"

58
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:37,640
"Huh?!"

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,980
"Huh?! I finally feel comfortable!"

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,880
"Aah..."

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,680
"Even so, it's a big garden..."

62
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,780
"Even so, we're the most popular neighborhood around here."

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
"Huh..."

64
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,520
"If it's this big, cleaning alone alone is a lot of work."

65
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,780
"What are you going to do with that?"

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,540
"A trash bin in the backyard..."

67
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,240
"I'll just throw it away."

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
"Okay, thanks for warning me."

69
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,500
"What's your name, sir?"

70
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,320
"Are you Shogun?"

71
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,100
"Your name is Shogun. Are you a Shogun, too?"

72
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,780
"You're a Shogun, too, aren't you?"

73
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,980
"No. What's your name?"

74
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,040
"I'm a Shogun. I don't know why I am..."

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,560
"Oh, I'm Shogun, too."

76
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,040
"Ah..."

77
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:23,660
"I have one too!"

78
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,480
*Dogs barking*

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,020
Hm?

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,680
Hm?

81
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,980
What is this?

82
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,480
Ah!

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,420
It's a...

84
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,160
It's a bat!

85
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,440
I mean, it's a toy anyway.

86
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,660
It's not that sweet in the world.

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,800
*Gasp*

88
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,080
Huh?

89
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,700
*Growls*

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,220
*Groans*

91
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
*Bite*

92
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Is this...

93
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,800
Is this real?

94
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,800
*Groans*

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,280
Hey, Tomari!

96
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,920
Good work!

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,160
Your tea's ready.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,260
Come over here and take a break.

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,840
N-No!

100
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,360
Never mind!

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,640
I hate tea!

102
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,620
I hate taking a break!

103
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,580
Huh?

104
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Never mind!

105
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,540
We're still in the middle of work.

106
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Right?

107
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,360
Is that so?

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,100
*Sigh*

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
500 yen is a little

110
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,440
different from what you'd expect.

111
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,560
I'll be back.

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,440
Ryozu?

113
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Ne... captain!

114
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,680
What are you doing over there?

115
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Not that.

116
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,900
How suspicious.

117
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,680
You are hiding something, arent you?

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,660
No, I am not hiding anything.

119
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,380
What is this?

120
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,320
Isn't this a hospital bed?

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,100
Looks like so...

122
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,760
Not a mother!

123
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Grandma!

124
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,120
Grandma! Grandma!

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,300
Yes?

126
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,920
The old man came out of the garden.

127
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,020
What? The old man?

128
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,760
Damn it! I found him!

129
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,980
The old man belongs to the old woman!

130
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,740
There's no other way, Ryo.

131
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,820
There was definitely a writing saying that the ancestor of the road builder was buried.

132
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,700
It's bad for the factory. You should give up quietly.

133
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,520
That's right. It's happy to just taste the old man's food.

134
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,260
Is Ryo-tsu here?

135
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,080
Who?

136
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,040
Ryo-tsu is here, but I need to help dig a hole.

137
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,780
Chief, I'm good at digging holes.

138
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh.

139
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh, oh.

140
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,860
Ryo-tsu's performance so far has been very good, dear.

141
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,300
Even the way he speaks has changed.

142
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,100
He's becoming a Miyabi.

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,920
Therefore, I have granted a reward to Ryo-tsu from the road builder family, dear.

144
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,120
Please accept it without hesitation.

145
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,680
Well, goodbye, dear.

146
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,720
I was surprised to see that change.

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,260
Oh, what?

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,880
He said it was a reward, but there's only one piece.

149
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,720
He's so stubborn.

150
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Don't complain about getting things from people.

151
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,380
Oh, what?

152
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,620
It's just a piece of paper.

153
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,500
This is called a piece of paper.

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,700
1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, 1,000,000...

155
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,220
My heart is getting faster and faster.

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
10,000,000.

157
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,460
100,000,000.

158
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,340
100,000,000.

159
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,700
100,000,000?

160
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,040
100,000,000?

161
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:49,960
100,000,000?

162
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,260
100,000,000 for Ryo-chan?

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Ryo-tsu, be strong.

164
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,360
This is the last chance God has given you.

165
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,160
Spend all your money right now.

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,960
That's right.

167
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,900
This time, you should listen to what the chief says, Ryo-tsu.

168
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,940
That's right.

169
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,440
If you think about using it for your senior's sake,

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,160
it will be gone in no time.

171
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,960
Spend?

172
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,680
That's my book.

173
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
I don't have such a book.

174
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,060
You idiot.

175
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,260
Listen carefully, Ryo-tsu.

176
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,960
There's a fairy tale called "Ari and Kirigiri".

177
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,500
I don't know such a thing.

178
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,600
I know about the battle between Ari and Inoki.

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,920
Once upon a time, there was a place where Ari and Kirigiri lived.

180
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,700
One day, God gave them 100,000,000 yen for free.

181
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,360
Wow, that's a lot of money.

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,580
Let's play hard with this.

183
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,580
Kirigiri-san thought it was better to play when he was young.

184
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,620
Let's buy a car.

185
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,940
I want a bike.

186
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
And then, let's go abroad.

187
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
He spent all his money on leisure activities and enjoyed his life.

188
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,700
On the other hand, Ari-san spent 100,000,000 yen on regular activities and worked hard to increase his income.

189
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,540
Eventually, he bought a small land.

190
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,420
It's my land.

191
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,240
Let's build a house here.

192
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,340
Twenty years later, he built a house.

193
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,500
All the money was transferred to the house and he started to buy more and more.

194
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,840
Later, when Ari-san was up on the bench, he used 100,000,000 yen to sell the house on the motorway.

195
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,180
The 기리기리.

196
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,320
I guess you messed it up.

197
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,160
Did you understand the importance of saving?

198
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,260
There is something we shouldn't have told you.

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,900
Ah, I see.

200
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,820
Actually, that's true.

201
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,200
But money can be used.

202
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,680
What did you say?

203
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,100
Don't say it in the stereo! I got it!

204
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,900
Then, this time, I'll listen to what the chief says and save it all.

205
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,780
That's right. 20 years later,

206
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,240
"Oh, I'm glad I listened to what the chief said."

207
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,840
The day will come.

208
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
But is this really worth 100 million?

209
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,040
You don't seem to understand unless you show me the cash.

210
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
This is all my money!

211
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
Now, I understand, Ryotsu.

212
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,380
Senpai!

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,940
Ryotsu!

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,360
Are you alright, Renko?

215
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,500
Wait, Ryotsu!

216
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,960
Senpai, as soon as I saw the cash,

217
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,600
it was completely wild.

218
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,380
It's like showing a cat a dried bonito.

219
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't care anymore!

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,420
I want to be a stray like Key Gillis!

221
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,120
It's all my money!

222
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,180
It's all mine!

223
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,660
What should I do first?

224
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,500
Try to make a full account of the money you have.

225
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,980
They said it's a special sushi.

226
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm going to buy some sandals.

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,860
Oh, I see.

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,700
I'll buy sandals for 10 years!

229
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,460
What?

230
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,440
What are you going to do next?

231
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,520
I have a lot of money.

232
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,120
What?

233
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,060
That's right. Let's buy sandals.

234
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,620
Is that so?

235
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,140
The third race

236
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,460
The fourth race

237
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,180
The fifth race

238
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,520
The sixth race

239
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,840
This is the Kirigiri style.

240
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:35,820
The fifth race

241
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,040
Did you spend all 100 million yen?

242
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,760
I knew it.

243
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,460
It was only a day.

244
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,420
I said that much, but I was completely stunned.

245
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,120
I thought you would help me.

246
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,480
I spent 500 yen.

247
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,080
Please help me.

248
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,240
I don't know.

249
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,360
I don't think I've lost 100 yen.

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,460
Is it your day-to-day bath?

251
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,520
Are you sick?

252
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,540
What's wrong?

253
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,160
Are you sick?

254
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,680
Do you hurt somewhere?

255
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,240
No, I'm a little dizzy.

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,860
It can't be helped.

257
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
I'll take you to the hospital.

258
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
I'll take you to the hospital.

259
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm hungry.

260
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,300
I'll pick up a strange old man.

261
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,420
Thank you.

262
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,740
I feel much better.

263
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm going to eat bread.

264
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,700
We will eat together.

265
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,220
Are you drawing a picture?

266
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,900
Are you drawing a picture?

267
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,780
Yes, it's a picture of an old man.

268
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,020
Which one?

269
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,700
I'll take a look.

270
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,360
What's this?

271
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,720
It's not easy to understand.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,420
I'm often told that.

273
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,220
Anyway, the picture is terrible.

274
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,380
I'm 100 times better.

275
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,300
I can't draw what I like.

276
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm a serial manga artist.

277
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,120
But I became an anime director in the series.

278
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,980
Do you know?

279
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,060
That's a bit of a lie.

280
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,380
I'll teach you how to draw.

281
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
You should start over from the basics.

282
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,440
You're very modest.

283
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,160
So you drew my face.

284
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,680
What do you think is similar?

285
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,720
It's worse than manga.

286
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,480
I remember seeing this picture somewhere.

287
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,260
I did, too.

288
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,380
Look at this.

289
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,060
This sign...

290
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,900
It's Okamoto Bakudan-sensei!

291
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,440
What?!

292
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,840
He's a world-famous abstract artist!

293
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,240
If it's Bakudan-sensei's painting, it'll be worth thousands of dollars!

294
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,440
A poor artist like him?

295
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,720
I-If you say that, it feels like an artistic work.

296
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,600
Ryotsu!

297
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,200
What the hell did you do?!

298
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,980
W-What are you talking about?!

299
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,320
The human-revealed Okamoto Bakudan's painting is for you!

300
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,220
I even visited his office!

301
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,180
I visited his office!

302
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,380
Did you paint or light a fire in the studio?

303
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,700
Be quiet and say your lines!

304
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,280
You're wrong!

305
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,380
Senpai saved the place where Okamoto Gahaku was dead!

306
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,720
What did you say?

307
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,160
This is... this is... Ryotsu-sama...

308
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,380
You're from that old man's place, right?

309
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,700
In fact, my husband passed away the other day...

310
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm sorry...

311
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,920
Huh?! That old man?!

312
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,720
Sorry...

313
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,340
She was alive...

314
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,540
I was afraid that I couldn't hear...

315
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,840
I should have martyred him, no matter what, but...

316
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,060
You're right.

317
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,240
I was very curious about this, and I've decided to ask you to give your property to me from now on.

318
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,060
Ryotsu-sama...

319
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,040
I heard that Okamoto Gahaku's estate used to be his property, Ryotsu-sama.

320
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,200
You can see that there's a lot left in his house.

321
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,200
I think I can even make a transfer to him now.

322
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,140
I can!

323
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,200
Why?

324
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,820
I, Ryotsu, will do anything this time!

325
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,260
W-w-wait a minute!

326
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,040
There are so many numbers, I can't find them!

327
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,960
There are 200 cases worth 100 million yen.

328
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,420
All of them are 10,000 yen bills?

329
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,900
Of course!

330
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,300
That's amazing!

331
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,860
I'm getting dizzy.

332
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,880
I have a little blood pressure.

333
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,960
Are you okay?

334
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,560
Master is envious of Ryotsu's free and honest way of life.

335
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,660
He said he had a lot of fun meeting you.

336
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,200
So, please use up all of this property as you please.

337
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,540
Use up everything?

338
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,580
Ryo, that's not good! Stop it!

339
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,260
However, there is a deadline.

340
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,380
A deadline?

341
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,400
That's right.

342
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Master's request is to use up all of it in one week.

343
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,400
If you can't use up half of the 100 million yen in one week,

344
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,300
you'll be fined for the whole amount.

345
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,720
100 million yen in one week?

346
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,960
I can't take it anymore.

347
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,160
Me neither!

348
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,180
All right! I got it!

349
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,000
You said you got it, Ryo!

350
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,600
I'll use up all of it with my grandpa's will!

351
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,200
Are you serious, Master?

352
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,040
That's my grandpa's will, so I have no choice but to do it!

353
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,300
Even if you use up 100 million yen,

354
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,460
you'll still have the remaining 100 million yen.

355
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,700
Is there such a good story?

356
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,300
I'm glad you said that.

357
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,120
That's why you're the man I saw in my husband.

358
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,440
I'll take this will to my husband and deliver it to him.

359
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,500
Leave it to me!

360
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,220
All right, let's go!

361
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Otaro, you're a big man,

362
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
and you're a big man, too!

363
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Let's eat!

364
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,940
Yum!

365
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,520
Yum!

366
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,420
Yum!

367
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,660
Yum!

368
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,600
In a gold box!

369
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,360
Well!

370
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,640
How much is this?

371
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,720
It'll be 180,000 yen!

372
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,980
What?

373
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,080
Just that much?

374
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,740
That's 99,99882,000 yen.

375
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,940
What?

376
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,140
Okay, I'll buy three more souvenirs!

377
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,240
What?

378
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
We're still starting.

379
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm going to Tokyo.

380
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,900
I bought all the toys in the market.

381
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,620
It's a bit cramped.

382
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,440
The master who died can't be found.

383
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,900
What the rich guy is doing is...

384
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
It's a big cruiser!

385
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,320
Move, move!

386
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,160
You will die if you crash!

387
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,420
You will die if you crash!

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,720
You drink champagne while looking at the sunset.

389
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,560
This is what the rich guy does.

390
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,480
You still have a long way to go.

391
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,480
I know.

392
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,340
Speaking of what the rich guy does...

393
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,660
The other day, a policeman who owned a huge property in Okamoto Bakudan started doing something terrible.

394
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,480
He said,

395
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,960
"Where do you live?"

396
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,080
He started to build a house to run a private railway from Shinshin-ryo to Kimusaki-no-Koban.

397
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,440
Ryo-san, are you sure you want to run a train here?

398
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,460
I'll get back to Ryo with my Nico Nico-ryo!

399
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,960
It's called Gorgeous Nico Nico-ryo!

400
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,160
This is the Cinderella police officer, Ryo Tsuchi.

401
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,740
Today, he plans to buy all the seats at Tokyo Dome and play baseball.

402
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,000
Gorgeous Nico-ryo!

403
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,560
What's that?

404
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,920
It's a

405
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,440
This is not a regular show.

406
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,740
This is the

407
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,940
Gorgeous Nico-ryo police, Ryo Tsuchi.

408
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,040
This is not a normal show.

409
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,420
This is the

410
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,440
If that's the case, Master will be in pain because of the grasshopper.

411
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,380
I got it, I got it.

412
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,280
All right, I'll go to Ginza after this and get rid of the grasshopper.

413
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,500
That won't happen.

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
You can't throw it away, bury it, or burn it.

415
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,780
This is Master's order.

416
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,900
You have three days left, and you have to use it all up.

417
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,660
Hmm.

418
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,400
It's surprisingly hard to use money.

419
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,580
Huh?

420
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,940
What's under the chair?

421
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,320
What's this?

422
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,120
It's a jewel.

423
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,340
There it is!

424
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,240
Oh, Baghdad! Sindbad! Oganbad!

425
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,160
Huh? What is it?

426
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,020
This person lost that jewel.

427
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,960
It's worth tens of billions, so he's giving me a share.

428
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,660
W-What?!

429
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,480
I told you I didn't need it!

430
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,940
I have one more truck.

431
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,280
Master Ryo...

432
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
I know.

433
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,020
All right, next is Tokyo.

434
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,740
He won't be able to find it.

435
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:40,280
All right, now we're having a workaholic cały.

436
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,780
Here we go.

437
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:41,840
Oh, good idea.

438
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,500
Hey, what's the Can I do esto?

439
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,160
I know the

440
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,580
Shimmyland!

441
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:57,760
I know you!

442
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,400
I know you!

443
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,580
How's that?

444
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,600
Oh, wonderful! This is the character I've been looking for!

445
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,700
What's your name?

446
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,540
My name is Walton Mazmy!

447
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Please let me use this painting!

448
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll spend 1 billion yen for the character's usage!

449
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,580
I told you I don't need it!

450
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,580
You've got another one!

451
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,100
Oh, my lord! My late master has been thrown into the well!

452
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,500
It's not my fault!

453
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,860
Now, I've got a horse! I'll spend 3 billion yen on it!

454
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
Hey, sis!

455
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,060
Yes!

456
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,980
I'll spend 3 billion yen on the Thunder Roller!

457
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,800
200 meters to go!

458
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,380
The 2nd popular Riding Bull is coming up!

459
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,360
The most popular Thunder Roller is coming!

460
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,320
The popular Sidebinder is coming!

461
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,020
A fierce battle is about to start!

462
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,340
Oh, my!

463
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,060
The sidebinder is falling!

464
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,120
It's attacking the Aegean Hyacinth!

465
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,400
The 2nd horse is on the move!

466
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,760
The Riding Bull is also coming up!

467
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,380
The horses in the middle are coming up, too!

468
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,420
The real match is about to start!

469
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,100
The 1st place is the most popular Thunder Roller!

470
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,660
Why?

471
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,360
Why?

472
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,280
Why?

473
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,440
Why?

474
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,280
Why?

475
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Why?

476
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,760
Why?

477
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,080
Why?

478
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,160
Why?

479
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,400
Why?

480
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,600
Huh?

481
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
Why?

482
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,260
The 2nd horse is coming up!

483
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,860
The 4th horse is coming up!

484
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,460
The 6th horse is coming up!

485
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,840
Oh, my God!

486
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,520
The 6th horse is coming up!

487
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Not if you're a player!

488
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,660
All right!

489
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:53,700
What if I pull this!

490
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,300
It's okay.

491
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,940
You're both a piece of shit!

492
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,620
I've brought out all the money.

493
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,900
I'm finally free from you, old man!

494
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,300
Oh, right, I'm saving!

495
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,020
If I save this much, I can live a luxurious life with only my money!

496
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,880
What bell is that?

497
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,220
I'm sorry, but I'm running out of time.

498
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,760
Wh-wh-what?

499
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,020
Goodbye, old man Ryo.

500
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,380
Tickle.

501
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,620
What kind of thing is that?

502
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,300
So what about Ryo?

503
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,040
It's not known where he dropped it.

504
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,840
He was running out of money, so he got the punishment.

505
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,780
He's self-sacrificing.

506
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,360
I'm hungry.

507
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,020
I don't need money, so let me eat something.

The blue aunt who is above us

525

Please come up and see

526
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
That corner

527
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,760
Everyone, everyone can meet

528
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,700
Let's go!

529
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,920
There is a wall

530
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,440
Ah, there must be a wall

531
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,360
Everyone, come to our town

532
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,500
Thank you!
