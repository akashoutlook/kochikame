00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,040

00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,980
It's coming, it's coming!

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,300

Ah! Summer's coming again this year,

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,740
It's coming, it's coming!

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,620
It's coming, it's coming!

And the sisters of the mini potas!

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,560
Sisters, do your best!

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,560
Thanks, I've got more to do.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,140
I've got lots of Amikoshi , it's so busy.

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,500
It's natural that the festival is lively.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,400
It will be more lively from now on.

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, Reiko!

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,600
The main event of the festival is coming up.

45
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,060
It's a festival of the main event of the festival.

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,660
There are so many shrine maiden.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,140
Yes, they are.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,420
They will compete in the shrine and decide which one is the best.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,220
It will be the main event of the festival.

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,060
Wow, here it comes.

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,480
Over here.

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,640
You're late, Ryo-san.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,360
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,060
I was worried that you wouldn't come.

55
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,840
It's true.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,160
Our festival is the top three years in a row thanks to you.

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,140
You're like a famous name for edokko now.

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,420
Really?

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,820
Yes, edokko of edokko.

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Ryo-san, edokko number one.

61
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,220
Super edokko Ryo-san.

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,540
I'm the best edokko in the universe.

63
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,820
I'm so happy when you say the truth.

64
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm so happy when you say the truth.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,140
He said the edokko is edokko?

66
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,480
You should make him laugh.

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
He seems to be happy to be called a scourge.

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,760
I can't say this is the real edokko.

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,240
What?

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
I can't see you.

71
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,300
What kind of introduction?

72
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,080
This man here,

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,440
he's said edokko in edokko as Kin-san,

74
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,480
he's my sister-in-law's assistant.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,440
What?

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,020
Every year, I can't make you guys big.

77
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,380
I can't let you do that.

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,760
You're a fake.

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,540
I'll peel your skin.

80
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,200
You're funny.

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,960
You're the one who's going to have a hard time.

82
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,420
Go ahead!

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,540
That's, that's amazing.

84
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,040
You're something you're not good at.

85
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,520
But you're really sharp.

86
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,000
Anyone who wins will be able to do something.

87
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm going to bring down Mario from the top of the building.

88
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,220
That's how sharp I am!

89
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm telling you!

90
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Hey, Ryo-san!

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,520
A Edo-kko should stand on top of a Miko-shi!

92
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,820
You're sitting on top of a Miko-shi!

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,220
You're going to get your back in trouble!

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,800
Standing is just one leg!

95
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,200
Edo-kko's number one is a race!

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,100
So that's how it is.

97
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,240
This is a nice view!

98
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,360
I can't ride an Edo-kko without knowing this guy!

99
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,160
It's not like you can stand on a slope!

100
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,620
Edo-kko means this!

101
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,980
What? This is the real Edo-kko!

102
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,880
No, this is the real Edo-kko!

103
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,460
This is the real Edo-kko!

104
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
This is the real Edo-kko!

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,580
This is the ultimate Edo-kko!

106
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,760
Are you okay, Ryo-san?

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,160
You're getting sick!

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,600
Ryo-san, you're...

109
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,820
You're acting weird.

110
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,540
Yeah, this is the ultimate...

111
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:32,700
Shut up!

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,340
If you keep this up, I'll have to do something.

113
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,900
Alright, let's go!

114
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,520
It's a shortcut!

115
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll beat you!

116
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,840
This is a shortcut, too!

117
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,340
You're doing great!

118
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,940
One, two, three,四!

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,500
Come on!

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,880
You're really strong!

121
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,180
Come on, Ryo!

122
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,260
You're doing great!

123
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,920
This is great!

124
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,700
Yes, this is the ultimate Edo-kko...

125
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,860
Come on, Ryo!

126
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,280
Ryo, Ryo, Ryo, Ryo!

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,360
Come on, Ryo!

128
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,400
Come on, Ryo!

129
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
Come on, Ryo.

130
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,200
Darn it!

131
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,600
You're losing your ego!

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,160
All right!

133
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,820
We're all in this together.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,900
You're the first one alone, wasn't you?

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,480
Let me pass him on.

136
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,120
You don't have a weapon, do you?

137
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,000
-You idiot! -Let him go!

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,780
He must be hiding in the shrine!

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,920
How did we ever forget that?

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,160
We can't stop him once!

141
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,360
What are they?

142
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Go! Go! Go!

143
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,100
Damn you, you idiot!

144
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,200
Are you okay, senpai?

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,120
Damn it!

146
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll miss the four consecutive championships,

147
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
I'll be scolded for destroying the shrine and the shrine maiden,

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,500
I'll be humiliated!

149
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,780
I'll be punished!

150
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,200
This is all because of that bastard!

151
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,500
Damn it!

152
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,160
Damn it!

153
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,720
Everything is all his fault!

154
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,080
Are you going to take a bath too?

155
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,120
I don't care where I take a bath!

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,240
Senpai!

157
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,960
Get out of the way!

158
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,800
You can't get in!

159
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,520
Get out of the way!

160
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I don't feel like giving you guys anything...

161
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,620
Get out of the way!

162
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,320
Dad!

163
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,340
I'll take this!

164
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,020
Um...Ryo-san, you're going to fish, right?

165
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,580
I'll take the first round!

166
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,560
I'll take the first round!

167
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:43,660
I'll take the first round!

168
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,900
It's 370 yen, so...

169
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,280
I'll take the first round!

170
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,800
I'll take the first round!

171
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,540
I don't need fishing today!

172
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,260
Senpai!

173
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,160
You're definitely the best!

174
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,140
I'll get you!

175
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Thisivering as the best is me!

176
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Thisivering as the best is me!

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
Senpai, what was that roar just now?

178
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,760
Roar?

179
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,740
I couldn't hear any screams...

180
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,380
It must be a coincidence...

181
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,840
But...

182
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,860
It must be a coincidence!

183
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,980
Um...

184
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
You're the first ones to go to the bath.

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,960
What?

186
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,960
What?

187
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
I was just about to go in.

188
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,380
Oh, this way too.

189
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,740
Don't shake it.

190
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,340
It'll make the hot water run out.

191
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,860
That way.

192
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,940
Nakagawa!

193
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,540
Help me with the boiler.

194
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,600
It's too warm. I'll catch a cold.

195
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,060
Oh...

196
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,840
You're raising the temperature?

197
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,540
Yeah, it's still warm.

198
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,100
That's strange. I was going to heat it up.

199
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,280
It's starting to warm up a little.

200
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,820
It's starting to warm up a little.

201
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:24,920
It's starting to warm up a little.

202
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,180
You're laughing at me.

203
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,520
The bath is still too warm.

204
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,760
Nakagawa, it's not warm at all.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
Let me boil some more!

206
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,500
Is it still warm?

207
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,620
It's warm!

208
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,720
Oh, it's over 60 degrees.

209
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,920
That's not human temperature.

210
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,600
I told you it was warm, so it's warm.

211
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,020
I don't know what 60 degrees is, but it's cold.

212
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,900
I don't know what 60 degrees is, but it's cold.

213
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,680
It's still like ice water!

214
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,980
Go back to your place for a while!

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,340
I understand.

216
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,560
Ah, it's cold!

217
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm going to get a cold!

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,080
Nagagawa, do something!

219
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,980
Y- yes!

220
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,400
Cold Air

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,960
This is the high firepower product used by Nakagawa Hei.

222
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
This is the high firepower product used by Nakagawa Hei.

223
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,320
This is the high firepower product used by Nakagawa Hei.

224
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,500
This can heat up to a million times at once.

225
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,100
I see.

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,420
Ah! This bubble is the main feature!

227
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,700
Fw-f-fue-fu!

228
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,880
After all, it's so easy and beautiful...

229
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,440
If I don't watch it boiling, I won't be in the bath!

230
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,400
This dumbass.

231
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,620
The water is boiling and he's making all that noise.

232
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,440
He won't even stop...

233
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,960
That's dangerous!

234
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,060
Senpai!

235
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,480
Senpai! Senpai!

236
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,720
Senpai!

237
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you okay?

238
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,220
I need to explode.

239
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,280
I can't even stand like this.

240
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm home.

241
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,120
Ryo, are you okay?

242
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
No, I'm not.

243
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,800
I bought sushi for you.

244
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
What? Sushi?

245
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,300
Senpai, are you okay?

246
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,380
I woke up because of the word "sushi".

247
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,540
I'm not good at sushi.

248
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,920
I can't believe you.

249
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,860
It's okay, but you should wear pants.

250
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,300
You don't have a delicacy.

251
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,620
I don't have such a word in my dictionary.

252
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,100
It's painful.

253
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
What's wrong?

255
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
What's this sushi?

256
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,680
Avocado roll.

257
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,940
Avocado?

258
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,140
It's a sushi from the west coast of America.

259
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,540
It's healthy and very popular.

260
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,040
The west coast of America?

261
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,780
Healthy?

262
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,940
I'm not kidding!

263
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,220
How do you know it's in front of Edo?

264
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,680
Do you know what it means?

265
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,640
It's a sushi from the west coast of Edo.

266
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,660
It's made of fish caught in the Tokyo Bay.

267
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,020
It's called sushi from the west coast of Edo.

268
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not a real sushi.

269
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,600
What are you doing?

270
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,340
Ryo!

271
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,660
It's not that.

272
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,060
Riko bought it for you.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Even so,

274
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,520
my body cannot accept sushi from the west coast.

275
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
I can't accept sushi from the west coast.

276
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,780
Then,

277
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,840
let me eat the real sushi from the west coast.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,520
What?

279
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,780
I want to know the difference between the real sushi from the west coast and the sushi I bought.

280
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,220
I can't understand your attitude unless I compare them.

281
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,060
I got it.

282
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,280
You can take me with you.

283
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,700
If you take me,

284
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:40,880
I'll take you.

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,420
How will Edo-mai make me eat sushi?

286
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm looking forward to it.

287
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,360
For the first time,

288
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,700
I'm getting a treat from Senpai.

289
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,700
Damn it.

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,060
He's so good.

291
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,000
Let me choose there.

292
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Senpai,

293
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,640
how far are you going?

294
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,920
A bit further.

295
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,880
You're not going to the sushi restaurant up ahead?

296
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,040
Hey, I thought you were someone else.

297
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,040
You're just a kid from Edo.

298
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,140
Huh?

299
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,100
Oh, you're from the daytime!

300
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,020
Huh?

301
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,180
You're the one who fought with Ryo-chan?

302
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,180
You're from a sushi restaurant?

303
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,220
Yeah, I've been in the sushi business for 500 years.

304
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,220
Since Toyotomi Hideyoshi was still in Hiroshima,

305
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,460
I've been visiting this place frequently,

306
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,640
and I've been a huge fan of Tokugawa Ieyasu's Komo Hiiki.

307
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,880
Let's go, Nakagawa Reiko.

308
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,460
If you keep fighting with such a big-ass guy,

309
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,860
it's gonna make you sick.

310
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,260
Hey, hey.

311
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,820
You're not going to join that sushi restaurant, right?

312
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,660
I'm not going anywhere.

313
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm not going anywhere.

314
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm not going anywhere.

315
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,920
Huh?

316
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,240
Huh?

317
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,080
Isn't that the restaurant?

318
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,020
No, it's not.

319
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,040
We're going to this restaurant.

320
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,940
You're going to satisfy us, right?

321
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,740
Sushi!

322
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,860
You're going to satisfy us, right?

323
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,820
You're going to satisfy us, right?

324
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,540
Then we'll give you a real one!

325
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,500
Sushi!

326
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,280
Well, what should we do?

327
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,620
This kind of restaurant is usually very expensive.

328
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,760
So we're going to make a cheap one.

329
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,520
There's a delicious one with sea urchin in it, miss.

330
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
Then I'll take that one!

331
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,580
What?

332
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,680
What's wrong?

333
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,760
N-no, it's nothing.

334
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,080
I-I don't really know you too.

335
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,320
That's a good one.

336
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
Then I'll take that one!

337
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,380
O-O-O-O-Oi!

338
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,580
Why?

339
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,180
Are you curious what was in my wallet?

340
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,360
A-a lucky guy.

341
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,440
Sushi is so hard work to handle,

342
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,600
it's not like a real Edos-kko gets paid for it.

343
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,700
Y-you fool.

344
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm...

345
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,260
What about the toilet?

346
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,540
Right there...

347
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,520
All that sea urchin and sushi will be 5000 yen.

348
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
I've ordered many cheap things, but...

349
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,840
I've ordered many cheap things, but...

350
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,080
20,000 was a little too much.

351
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,980
First I should do something about this and get him to call me.

352
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,760
Yes, wait for me.

353
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,320
You surprised me!

354
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,740
It's time!

355
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,340
This guy...

356
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,740
He kept bringing up high stuff again...

357
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm going to...

358
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,000
Hey, I'll make this draft to be sold on the bill.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,540
Heh!

360
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,220
Hehehe, Kanpyo-maki, huh?

361
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,060
Here, the cheapest Kanpyo-maki in the world!

362
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,740
It's a must-read.

363
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,480
It's a trick-or-treating.

364
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,760
Huh? What's this?

365
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,360
What's Kanpyo-maki?

366
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, this is Kanpyo-maki?

367
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,640
The seaweed is shiny, and there's only one Kanpyo in it.

368
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,840
How can a small kid like this eat edok?

369
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,080
I've been listening to you for 500 years.

370
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,580
This is not real Edomaizushi.

371
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,880
Let's go, Reiko Nakagawa.

372
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,760
Yes, sir.

373
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,700
Um, where's the money?

374
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,580
There's a fake sign.

375
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,040
You don't have to pay for fake Edomaizushi.

376
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,100
Mission accomplished.

377
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,480
Wait a minute!

378
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,340
Giku.

379
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,900
That Kanpyo-maki is just a pretext.

380
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,200
This is the real Kanpyo-maki!

381
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,340
Ugh!

382
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,460
I know, right?

383
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,160
Edomaizushi's Kanpyo-maki is this big.

384
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,820
I'm happy to hear that.

385
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Damn, you're pretty good.

386
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,860
You're good at making people do as they please.

387
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,200
So, who's next?

388
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,660
Oh, right.

389
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,560
I'll get some sea urchins, too.

390
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,120
Here's a sea urchin's Gunkan-maki.

391
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,680
No.

392
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,100
It's a sea urchin's Space Battleship-maki.

393
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,860
Space Battleship-maki?

394
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,660
You can't do that?

395
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,860
What?

396
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,300
Is there anything I can't do?

397
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,180
Just a minute.

398
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,820
Space Battleship... Space Battleship...

399
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,100
Space Battleship... Space Battleship...

400
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,460
Oh, this is it!

401
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,880
Hey, Obachi!

402
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,700
How's that?

403
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,360
It's a Space Battleship-maki.

404
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,820
What's this?

405
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,640
It's a cannon and a gun.

406
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,160
It's cool, right?

407
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,880
You fool!

408
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,380
A cannon isn't the only thing in the ship.

409
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,080
This is a Space Destroyer-maki.

410
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,660
W-w-wait a minute.

411
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,140
I don't see many people who ask for a sea urchin's Space Battleship-maki.

412
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
This is the real one!

413
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,660
A sea urchin's Space Battleship-maki!

414
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,820
Next!

415
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,600
This is it!

416
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,100
I don't think I can find it in a sushi restaurant unless I eat this.

417
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,620
A sea urchin's Space Battleship-maki is the best.

418
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,740
Then, I'll eat it in one bite.

419
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,100
What?

420
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,340
Sea urchins can be eaten in one bite, right?

421
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
Of course!

422
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,560
What's next?

423
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,500
I see.

424
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,380
I'll have a snack.

425
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,720
There's nothing I can't eat.

426
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,040
Right.

427
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,960
I'll have a Katsuo-mezashi .

428
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,860
A Katsuo-mezashi?

429
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,240
Yes!

430
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,420
A Katsuo-mezashi!

431
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,240
A Sugatamikiri of a lobster!

432
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes!

433
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,520
A Kappa-sugatamaki!

434
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,280
Yes!

435
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,540
Curry rice!

436
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,360
Yes, curry rice!

437
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,460
Sake and salmon roe rice balls!

438
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,560
Here it comes!

439
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,140
A tuna haki!

440
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,080
Wait a minute!

441
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,240
It's completely the same.

442
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,920
He's like a child.

443
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,460
What's next?

444
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,980
There's still a lot of stuff to do.

445
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,960
I see.

446
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,200
Then, I'll have octopus.

447
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,060
It's alive!

448
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,600
Octopus is dancing on the rope.

449
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,840
That's octopus!

450
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,340
Yes!

451
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,520
Octopus!

452
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes, yes!

453
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,340
I'll eat it while it's fresh.

454
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,400
I'll have to eat this.

455
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,800
I'll have to eat this.

456
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,560
I'll have to eat this.

457
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,260
Oh, my God!

458
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,500
You're too lively.

459
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,860
I'll eat you if you laugh.

460
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,500
I'll have to eat you if you laugh.

461
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,500
I'll have to eat you if you laugh.

462
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll have to eat you if you laugh.

463
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,580
I'll have to eat you if you laugh.

464
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,820
I'll have to eat you if you laugh.

465
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,400
you have to hit me with a * * * * * *what vermiculer!

466
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,180
Senpai!

467
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,060
Senpai! Are you all right?

468
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,500
Senpai! Are you all right?

469
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,060
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

470
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,300
I got you!

471
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,540
I ate it.

472
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
See you later.

473
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,880
Two million yen!

474
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,960
It's not expensive, is it?

475
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
It's not expensive at all.

476
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
I was surprised that it was so cheap.

477
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,180
You're fine with the payment, right?

478
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
You're a kid, aren't you?

479
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,780
I'm a kid.

480
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,220
I'll go get the money, so wait a minute.

481
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,380
I'll be right back.

482
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:13,420
I'll pay for the meat.

483
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,240
I only have small things.

484
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,600
Can you count them for me?

485
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm happy.

486
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,600
I thought you wanted small things.

487
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,980
Lucky.

488
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,480
I thought you'd say that.

489
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
It's fun to play with you.

490
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,780
You're different.

491
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,180
Exactly.

492
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,280
The two of them are not laughing at all.

493
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,320
I want you to be gentle.

494
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,240
I was surprised when you said you wanted to be gentle.

495
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,700
Oh, it's not cute at all.

496
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,740
It's not cute at all.

497
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,860
You're so cute.

498
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,220
I'm sorry.

499
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm sorry.

500
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm sorry.

501
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,840
What's the matter?

502
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,420
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,940
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm sorry.

505
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,660
What happened?

507
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,860
You mean I and Reiko are going to live like this forever?

508
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,760
I don't like that!

509
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,980
Next time, I'm going to take care of Ryotsu and Reiko!

510
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,140
Let's smile anytime

511
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,100
Even if something crazy happens

512
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,460
Please smile cutely

513
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,760
It's okay to go out with a face like nothing

514
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,020
Please smile

515
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,100
You're not bad

516
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,940
Please smile

517
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,140
You're not bad

518
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,120
Please smile anytime

519
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,000
A dark-skinned woman is not pretty

520
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,900
You should smile right away

521
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,840
If you're not a child

522
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:36,980
You're not a child

523
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,080
You're not a child

524
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,620
Please smile
