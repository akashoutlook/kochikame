1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,960
Whiff pretty girl

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,940
When watching the television, please keep the room bright and try to look away

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,500
Come to me, you poor thing.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,040
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,860
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,520
I'll be fine.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,360
Come to me, you jobless.

8
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,840
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,480
I'll be fine.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,280
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,960
I'll be fine.

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,020
I know.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,960
I know.

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,840
If you know, come to me quietly.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,820
If you know, come to me quietly.

17
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,820
If you know, come to me quietly.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,320
Your work has caught up with trouble.

19
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,140
What will you do?

20
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,660
Leave it to your colleague.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,420
Solve it yourself.

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,960
A

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,000
Your boss came by chance.

24
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,280
What will you do?

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,860
Make excuses.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,300
P. Run away

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,100
Hmm, I'm at a lost place here, but it's B.

28
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,800
B. Your luck today is the worst day.

29
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,140
No matter what you do, it won't work.

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,840
What? That again?

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,820
This is the fifth time in a row.

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,460
I can't understand it now. Do it again.

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,020
Stop it already.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,680
Senpai!

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,340
Ah, Honda-san.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,060
Welcome.

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,380
What are you doing?

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,400
This.

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,360
It's a fortune-telling book on the magazine.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,840
Look, it's a flow chart.

41
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,700
Ah, you're choosing A or B.

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,060
Ryo-san, you've only had the worst day so far, and you're doing it again and again.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,480
Shut up! You didn't get a good result, did you?

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,940
Was it a very, very normal day?

45
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,920
Yeah, I'm normal and that's enough.

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,740
You don't have a good spirit.

47
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,140
It's not that kind of problem.

48
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,860
Ah, Tera-san, it's patrol time.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,940
Yeah.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
Well, I'm going.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,420
See you later.

52
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,900
Have a good trip.

53
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,540
Be careful.

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,520
Now, it's on, Reiko.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
Eh, you're still doing it?

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,500
Of course.

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,720
I'll do it as many times as I get a good result.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,120
Ah, wait a minute.

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,780
Yes, the exit before the park.

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,260
Ah, Chief Ohara.

61
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,320
Eh?

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,500
It's a bank robbery.

63
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,640
Huh?

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:29,760
Eh?

65
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,620
Yes, I understand.

66
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,200
Ryo-chan, it seems that the robber went to the Tsuchanaka Bank.

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,740
Go to the scene immediately.

68
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,640
Ah, I got it.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,200
Ah, God.

70
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,920
Dametaro Nihononosuke.

71
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,000
Long time no see.

72
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,700
You haven't been fired yet, you bad police officer.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,360
Don't bother.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,520
Where are you going, God?

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,160
Ah, an incident occurred.

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm going to the Tsuchanaka Bank from now on.

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,280
Wait.

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,400
Wait, my luck today is the worst.

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
If I go to the scene as it is ...

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,460
Prepare the car.

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Wait, my host, release me.

82
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,120
Shut up.

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah, ah, ah.

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,900
What a thing.

85
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,160
I'd rather leave this place to Dametaro than go myself.

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
What did you do?

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,060
OK, decided.

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,480
I left this incident to you.

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,520
Eh? Senpai.

90
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,620
If you do your best and give me a reward, you might be able to set up a robot police station.

91
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,680
Robot police station?

92
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Ah, I'm burning up.

93
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,860
Let's go, Dametaro.

94
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,880
Wait a minute.

95
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,600
Are you OK, senpai?

96
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,660
I don't care.

97
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,780
On such a bad day, it's better not to do any work.

98
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,560
Oh, you don't want to work so much.

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,380
Let's go.

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,300
I should have told Reiko immediately to you that you would be on the scene.

101
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,160
Oh no.

102
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,280
What should I do?

103
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,600
Should I make a good excuse or run away?

104
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,740
I'll run away.

105
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,320
Ah, Ryotsu.

106
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,740
Ugh...

107
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,320
Ugh, it'll get greasy.

108
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,420
Hey, I dropped my bag!

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,600
Wait!

110
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,820
Hononosuke!

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,960
Ginkogoutou, you're under arrest!

112
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,800
What?

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,060
Keep your swagger!

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,020
Watch your step, you idiot!

115
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,520
What? I'm an idiot?

116
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,120
Oh, no! If this happens...

117
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,400
Don't make fun of the robot!

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,420
That's...

119
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,820
Could it be...

120
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
I knew it.

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,300
Today is the worst day of my life.

122
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,760
Wait a minute!

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,460
It's too early to finish anything!

124
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,040
That's right.

125
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,760
I was wrong to run away from the chief there.

126
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,700
Do it again!

127
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm back.

128
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
What's back, Ryo-tsu?

129
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,080
I told you to go to the scene immediately.

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Now, here's the problem.

131
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,020
I was in a bad mood when I chose to run away from B.

132
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,820
This time...

133
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,540
It's A!

134
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,320
Actually, I just got a call from the hospital.

135
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
The father was in an accident and was hospitalized.

136
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,180
Your father is in a bad mood there.

137
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,300
Hey, Kankichi!

138
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,280
I dropped my wallet.

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,780
I met Oharu-san in a troubled place and let him stay in the bus.

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,620
So? Why are you here at this time?

141
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,760
I was wrong.

142
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,700
It was not my father, but my mother.

143
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,100
What did I do?

144
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,760
It's a shame to make a bad excuse.

145
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,860
If you don't want to be fired, go to the scene immediately!

146
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,520
But...

147
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Hey, Mike!

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,320
Don't!

149
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,600
Ryo-tsu, do something!

150
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,600
Stop!

151
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,320
Kankichi...

152
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
Get up!

153
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,580
Oh, that's the robot.

154
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
So, was that a bank robbery?

155
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,780
Get out of my way!

156
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,960
Kankichi, I like you and you stuck with me.

157
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,060
Ouch...

158
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,860
It's a gunpowder factory!

159
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,380
Alright!

160
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,180
You're under arrest!

161
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You're under arrest, you bank thief!

162
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,980
D-dumbass! You're in trouble for coming here!

163
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,880
What? You call that an idiot?

164
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,200
Stop making fun of Robots!

165
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,380
Stop it!

166
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,740
Today's the worst day of my life!

167
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,480
Wait a minute!

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,020
This is worse than before!

169
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,420
Oh, I see. I'm out when I see the chief.

170
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm going to start all over again!

171
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,280
Subtitles by Subdiver

172
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm back.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:28,880
What?

174
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Oh, nothing.

175
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,600
Where are you going, god?

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,880
Actually, there's an incident.

177
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm going to the Sucharaka Bank.

178
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,120
What's wrong?

179
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,540
If I choose A here, I'll meet the chief and have a terrible ending.

180
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,300
That means...

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,880
It's B!

182
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,160
Huh? B?

183
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,720
Sorry, but I don't have time to fight you.

184
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,620
Let's go, Honda!

185
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,820
Oh, yeah...

186
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,700
What the hell?

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
Let's go, boss of the Ryotsu!

188
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,200
Oh, god...

189
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,960
Now we can avoid the worst situation.

190
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,380
What are you talking about, boss of the Ryotsu?

191
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,620
Nothing! Don't worry about it!

192
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,860
A new pachinko shop.

193
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,800
A. Call the pachinko shop.

194
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
B. Go straight to the scene.

195
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay, it's A!

196
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,580
Honda, stop!

197
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,340
Huh?

198
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,640
Hey, didn't you go to the Sucharaka Bank?

199
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,000
It's okay. I'm not going to work today.

200
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,060
You don't know even if you're scolded later.

201
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,200
I did it!

202
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,660
Good job!

203
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:53,760
Haha...

204
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
I thought you'd get to do it.

205
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:57,980
Just get to the point, boss!

206
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,540
I think it's better to stop right now.

207
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,980
I don't even know what you're talking about.

208
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,660
Can I quit here?

209
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,940
Oh, I have something to tell you.

210
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,560
I prepared a special limited edition product for today's Prince.

211
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,800
It's a special black crab Wagyu!

212
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,220
Wow, a real cow!

213
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,460
I'll try it.

214
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,440
This is bad.

215
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,420
What? A cow thief?

216
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,840
Hey, that's not it!

217
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,140
Someone, catch me!

218
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,400
What? A cow thief?

219
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,380
God!

220
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,680
God!

221
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,220
Damedaro and Hono Onosuke!

222
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,780
If Hono Onosuke catches you, you'll be in trouble!

223
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,860
Run away! Get away from that stupid robot!

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
What? Stupid?

225
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
Don't make fun of robots!

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,280
Ha! Chester!

227
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,580
Alright, I've done enough.

228
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,520
Wait! Wait! Wait!

229
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,140
No!

230
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,860
Alright, I'm ready.

231
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,800
Let's take a break until the rehearsal.

232
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,940
Come on! Jump in!

233
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,840
What?

234
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,860
Today is the worst day ever!

235
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,780
No!

236
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,920
This is bad!

237
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,700
Let's start all over again!

238
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,620
The End

239
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,460
The End

240
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,180
The End

241
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,960
The End

242
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,020
The End

243
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,620
The End

244
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,220
The End

245
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,500
The End

246
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,020
The End

247
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,880
Died

248
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,320
Yeah...

249
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,380
I'm going!

250
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,160
Bye, bye, everyone.

251
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,000
Take care!

252
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,240
Take care.

253
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
Hey, you're back?

254
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,220
Huh? What's going on?

255
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,960
Ah, well, it's nothing...

256
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Wait a minute, okay?

257
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,020
What are you doing?

258
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,620
We make ourselves pretty고

259
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,640
If I analyze the pattern, I can choose the one I think is this.

260
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,240
The terrible ending is waiting.

261
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,500
That means...

262
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,460
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

263
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,260
I can choose the opposite.

264
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,260
Okay, I've decided! I'll choose the opposite thoroughly!

265
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,580
Ryo-chan, it seems that the robbers went to the Stock Exchange Bank.

266
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,980
Go to the scene immediately!

267
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,700
What?

268
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,040
I got it!

269
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Oh, God!

270
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,020
Hono Onosuke and Dametaro.

271
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm going to leave this place to Dametaro.

272
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,480
But I'm going to stay here.

273
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,060
Sorry, but I don't have time to fight you.

274
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,840
Let's go, Honda!

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,760
It's a new stock exchange.

276
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,960
I usually stay at the stock exchange.

277
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,720
But I'm going to stay here.

278
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,100
Oh!

279
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Hey, Ryo-san!

280
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,760
Hey, Pramoya! What's up?

281
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,620
I just got a call from a friend of the toy shop.

282
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,220
The limited edition figure of the C.I. Joe Asigaru version that Ryo-san was looking for...

283
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,740
It seems that it will be released in a hundred sets at the event venue in Hanyake.

284
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,480
What?

285
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,880
If I go now, I may be able to make it in time.

286
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,180
What should I do?

287
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,540
A. I'll go buy it right away.

288
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,680
B. I'll be patient here.

289
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,000
What should I do?

290
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,000
That's a given, right?

291
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,840
Of course!

292
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,860
Yes.

293
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,280
If I choose the picture here, it will fall into the same pattern as before.

294
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm sure it will be the same as before.

295
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,260
No, no!

296
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,540
This is B!

297
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,400
B?

298
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm on my way to work!

299
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,040
I don't have time to go to such a place!

300
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Hurry, Honda!

301
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
I got it.

302
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,300
I'll go to work!

303
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,500
Damn, the figure of the C.I. Joe...

304
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,060
What's up with that muzzled embroidered thing, McDonald?

305
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,520
Oh, nothing.

306
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,280
Hey, McDonald!

307
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,760
Oh, what's up, Sagonji.

308
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,140
I was down at a nice spot.

309
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,000
The limited edition DOKIMEMO FIGHT SUPER EDITION is going to be released at an Ikebukuro event.

310
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,700
What!?

311
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,200
Of course, you're going too, right?

312
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,740
I'm going to buy it right away.

313
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,880
I'll be patient here.

314
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,680
I want to go to the mountains, but now is not the time to do that.

315
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,580
Ryotsu...

316
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
"The Elephant

317
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,560
Oh, Ryotsu, you're in trouble.

318
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,960
The Elephant Winner Perfect Model is going to be sold at the event venue in Asakusa.

319
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,940
What?

320
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,700
It's hot!

321
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Oh, no!

322
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,380
No! I'm not going, absolutely not!

323
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,580
Honza, hurry!

324
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,840
Ryotsu...

325
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,060
Ryo, did you find the video you were looking for?

326
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:44,960
What?

327
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,620
Ryo, look at this!

328
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,920
Ryo, I got the ticket for the K-1.

329
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,880
Oh, Ryo, let's go to the K-1 together!

330
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,640
Hey, Ryo, I got a new ticket!

331
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,700
Oh, Kan-chan, it's been a while!

332
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,580
Ryotsu!

333
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,900
Ryo!

334
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,780
Ryo!

335
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,240
Ryo!

336
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,440
No! No! No!

337
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,980
You can't be fooled by such a choice!

338
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm going straight to the venue!

339
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,560
Oh, no!

340
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,240
I finally got here!

341
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,380
Oh, Ryo and K-1!

342
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,000
Komachi, Naoko, are you the only ones here?

343
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,780
Where are the others?

344
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,780
They're not here yet.

345
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,380
We happened to patrol the area and got the first place.

346
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,560
Is the culprit still inside?

347
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,320
Yes.

348
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,940
But we have to hurry and get him out of here.

349
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,960
Hmm, what's wrong?

350
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,760
A. I'm going to rush in right now.

351
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,260
B. I'm waiting for the support.

352
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,360
Hmm, they're both here.

353
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,800
I've got a bad feeling about this.

354
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm usually the one who tries to get my work done, so I'll go for A.

355
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,500
That means, on the contrary,

356
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,660
I'm going to go with B!

357
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,780
Huh?

358
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,640
If you force yourself on us, it'll be dangerous.

359
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,420
We're waiting for the support!

360
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,340
I got it!

361
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,160
Here he comes!

362
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm going to run away!

363
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,020
What are you going to do, Senpai?

364
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,080
Uh...

365
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,520
The culprit who ran to the right...

366
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,220
B. The culprit who ran to the left...

367
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,020
Baaaah!

368
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,440
It doesn't matter which way you go!

369
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,780
This is A!

370
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,940
A?

371
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,800
Me and Honda are going to chase the culprit who ran to the right!

372
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,200
You guys are going to chase the one who ran to the left!

373
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,400
Got it!

374
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:36,040
I got it!

375
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,640
Okay, we've caught up!

376
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,220
Baaaaah!

377
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,540
Whoa!

378
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,100
Baaaah!

379
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,740
Aaaaaaah!

380
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,080
Huh?

381
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,280
This is Kameari Stadium,

382
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,520
where the first baseball tournament by a construction worker

383
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,300
is about to begin!

384
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,280
The top batter is in position!

385
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,000
Booo!

386
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,520
With a power-shovel on top of him,

387
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,780
he's on to the first ball!

388
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,020
He threw it!

389
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,300
A cruiser!

390
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:08,760
Whoa!

391
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,540
Oh, oh!

392
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,520
It's growing up!

393
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,880
Will it fit in?

394
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,400
Oh, my!

395
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,060
It took Senta's crane!

396
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,760
No, it popped!

397
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,340
Now, the road roller on the left and the bulldozer on the right are heading for the ball!

398
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
The bulldozer has picked up the ball!

399
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,820
Oh, my!

400
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,460
Wh-Why am I in such a mess?

401
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
Oh, my!

402
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
The dump truck and the concrete mixer car are in contact!

403
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,560
Oh, my!

404
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,740
Oh, my!

405
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,020
The dump truck is in a mess!

406
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,520
And the concrete is flowing out of the mixer car!

407
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,560
What?

408
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,340
What?

409
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,560
Dynamite!

410
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,940
I don't like it!

411
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,480
Oh, my!

412
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,000
The concrete will get stuck at this rate!

413
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,220
Leave it to me!

414
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,440
Now, it's time for the special 97-type tank to come!

415
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,780
Stop!

416
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,320
Stop!

417
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,680
Oh, my!

418
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, no!

419
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,180
Today is the worst day ever!

420
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,180
NO!

421
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,680
NO!

422
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,340
As I thought, I'm going to choose the left side!

423
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,320
It's a B!

424
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,740
Oh, no!

425
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:25,940
My car is a mess!

426
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,500
What was that?

427
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:27,820
This is bee!

428
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,140
Senpai!

429
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,060
I'm going to run away!

430
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,080
Hey, it's a B!

431
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,920
B?

432
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,340
Me and Honda are pursuing the criminal who ran away to the left!

433
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,800
You two, follow the one who ran away to the right!

434
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,660
Go on, rip the pig skin!

435
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,200
I got it!

436
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,420
Wait, you bastard!

437
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,780
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

438
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,640
What's with you bastard?

439
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,460
Hey, stop! Let go!

440
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,240
You idiot!

441
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,040
Here at Kameari Stadium,

442
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,320
the first baseball tournament by a former construction worker is about to be held.

443
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,060
Play ball!

444
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,620
He's got the first ball with the power shovel on the mound.

445
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,900
He threw it!

446
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,600
Hey, Masaki! Stop!

447
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,960
He's got the pressure.

448
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,880
He shoots!

449
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,020
It's a big one!

450
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,360
He stretches it out and...

451
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,900
Will he get it?

452
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,760
Oh, he got the pressure in the center.

453
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,740
He took it!

454
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,040
No, he missed it!

455
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,700
In the end...

456
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,600
It's the same as before!

457
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,840
Hey!

458
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,540
Today's the worst day ever!

459
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,140
In the end,

460
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,980
we shouldn't wait for the cheering.

461
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,640
We have to do something about the scene.

462
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,260
We have to rush in right away.

463
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay, let's go back.

464
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,420
Is the culprit still inside?

465
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,200
Yes.

466
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,580
But we have to do something about it before he runs away.

467
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,320
Okay, A!

468
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,220
We're rushing in, Honda!

469
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,880
Mr. Ryoji, where do we start?

470
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,420
A, front.

471
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
B, back door.

472
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,660
C, window on the second floor.

473
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,680
This is A!

474
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,300
It's front!

475
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,440
Okay!

476
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,540
No!

477
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,280
This is not good!

478
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,420
Then, it's the next!

479
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,720
Mr. Ryoji, from where does he go in?

480
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,380
B, back door.

481
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,080
Okay!

482
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,940
Crap!

483
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,000
Why do they jump like this?

484
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,980
Next, C!

485
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,600
C, window on the second floor.

486
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,500
Shida, let's enter from the second floor!

487
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,120
Got it!

488
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,560
Damn it! There must be other options!

489
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,620
Make me do it more!

490
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,120
No matter what I say, today is the worst day ever!

491
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,660
Why is there no proper ending?

492
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,560
What's going on with today's story?

493
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,100
This is the flowchart of today's Gochikage!

494
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,020
There's not a single proper ending!

495
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,000
Damn it! I won't talk about this anymore!

496
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,800
It's over! It's over! It's over!

497
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,100
It's over!

498
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,680
Why? Why?

499
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
Why? Why?

500
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,080
Good morning! Why?

501
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,920
Lemon-chan is a kindergarten kid, but she loves historical drama. Why?

502
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,300
Why?

503
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,780
Her little mustache is slightly small. Why?

504
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,420
Why?

505
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,880
I wonder why her personality changes when she rides a Honda-san's bike.

506
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,320
Why? Why?

507
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,740
Why does she only live once in every four years? Why?

508
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:57,180
She doesn't lend money to her parents, but she can easily borrow a tank or a fighter. Why?

509
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,860
Why is that?

510
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,780
Reiko is a rich woman, but

511
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,840
She works at a sewage system. Why is that?

512
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,220
Why is that? Why is that? Why is that? Why is that? Why is that?

513
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,880
Next time

514
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,460
Huh? Chief Ohara is FUCKING ATTACKING the main city.

515
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,780
That's right, you have to get out of the city when a noisy man like you appears, don't you?

516
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,860
All right. I will get the two coins that the chief wanted.

517
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,100
I'll give you presents as a celebration.

518
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,960
Next time, the last present, I'll get them all.

519
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,260
Next Episode

520
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,600
A Soko wa Kameari

521
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,940
A Kitto Kameari

522
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,660
To our town

523
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,780
Thank you!
