22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,780
That's too late!

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
Oh, Mr. surplus isn't home yet?

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,520
It's normal for you to come 10 minutes before the next train.

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,860
Why are you so nervous?

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,540
I can't take it anymore. I'm going to eat.

27
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,540
You have 5 minutes to go to work.

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,840
Don't say such things.

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,120
Sorry for being late.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Who was that?

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,560
It was me. It was the monk.

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,420
No way!

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,780
I'm not surprised.

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,680
He is the monk.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,580
Don't be silly.

36
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,220
Monks are like this.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,500
They are like a human.

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,220
How can you say that?

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,600
If he were a monk, he would have a picture of his family.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,360
Then...

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,440
It's true. He has a picture of his family.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,680
Yes.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,220
We take pictures once a week.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,980
Riko, give it to me.

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,520
A picture of his family will be fine with me.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,700
That's why I learned that he was the monk.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,660
Was something wrong, Mr. Monk?

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,840
I had a hard time at work.

49
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,020
That's true. You said that you bought a house.

50
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,100
How long did the work take?

51
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,560
Around 7 hours at Charlie's.

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,120
7 hours!?

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
The manager did a 5-hourですね

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,860
That's 2 hours longer than the manager.

55
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,560
I only have a home we have to live in.

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,660
I can't afford it.

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,120
I don't want to help the family.

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,360
I usually get up before dawn.

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,720
It's bad to wake everyone up, so I eat a simple meal with the leftovers on the way.

60
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,220
I ride my bike for an hour to the station.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,000
When the night comes, I finally arrive at the station.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,380
The train is always full.

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,760
I have to change trains five times, but I'm late if I miss one.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
I have to work hard.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm late.

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,020
It's a turtle.

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,160
I have to go home repeatedly.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,920
It's sad.

69
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,860
I'll break my body.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,560
But my home is a dream of a working man.

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,740
I'll sacrifice a little.

72
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,540
It's cold.

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,060
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,760
If you try to eat something nutritious, you won't be able to move.

75
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
That's right. I was going to eat.

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
I'm going to eat something with stamina.

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I'm going to eat yakiniku.

78
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,320
I don't think you're trying to make me treat you to a meal, Ryo.

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,720
I don't have the money to eat.

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,980
I have to pay 350 yen for a meal a day.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,280
350 yen?

83
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,040
Then you can only buy bread and milk.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,940
That's a lot of money.

85
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,060
350 yen is enough.

86
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
I'll make you eat a lot of delicious food with a budget of 350 yen.

87
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,180
I'll make you eat a lot of delicious food with a budget of 350 yen.

88
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,900
Turtle.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
Welcome.

90
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,800
What should I give you today?

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,340
You're clearly lacking vitamins.

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,800
You need to take plenty of fruits.

93
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,060
Apple.

94
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,640
350 yen will cost you everything.

95
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,140
It's a fresh apple that just arrived from the farm today.

96
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,460
It's delicious and it makes me hungry.

97
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm hungry.

98
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,740
I'm hungry.

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,760
It's a fresh apple that just arrived from the farm today.

100
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,260
But there's too much dust in my belly.

101
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,240
It's been at the store for at least three days.

102
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,280
Give me 200 yen.

103
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,700
I can't afford it.

104
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,320
200 yen is enough.

105
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,500
It's a lot worse down there.

106
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,320
It's 100 yen.

107
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
It's no use. 100 yen is enough.

108
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,900
I can see that you're eating insects.

109
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,840
It's 50 yen.

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,660
I want to give you a contribution.

111
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,560
Yeah, time is running out.

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
You can't ask me for it.

113
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,660
Why is this apple so pulpid?

114
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,780
Ryo, widen your voice.

115
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,500
Are you planning to sell such a pulp apple to Mr. Shifu Kazushika?

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,500
What a poor shop.

117
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,620
It's overflowing.

118
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,600
I understand.

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,680
It's only 10 yen.

120
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,860
You can just bring it to me.

121
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
It's what you said in the beginning.

122
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
I can't afford it.

123
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm going to buy you a drink.

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,640
No, no, no.

125
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,140
This is a 500 yen blood-sucking service.

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,880
It's not even a good deal.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,140
Damn, he's a stubborn guy.

128
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,980
Oh, right.

129
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,540
By the way, you were in front of the market on Sunday.

130
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,020
I'm going.

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm sure your wife forbade you to gamble.

132
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,480
You're going to make me angry.

134
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,660
Miss!

135
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,720
It's true!

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,220
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa!

137
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,080
Oh, my God!

138
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,120
You!

139
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,860
What are you doing?

140
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa!

141
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:41,740
Stop crying.

142
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,700
Look, look.

143
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,460
Look, look.

144
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,160
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

145
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,640
Ryo, please forgive me.

146
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,820
My wife just came back from her parents' home.

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,940
Oh, that's good.

148
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
And how much is this?

149
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,180
I can't help it.

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,540
I'll give you 300 yen.

151
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,580
Hmm.

152
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:02,940
Miss!

153
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,860
It's true!

154
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,560
50 yen!

155
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,900
No, 30 yen is fine.

156
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,620
Hehe.

157
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,020
Oh, my gosh!

158
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,720
Hey, take it.

159
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,740
I'll take it.

160
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,920
No, no, no, no.

161
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,100
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,980
Ryo, you're really amazing.

163
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm starving.

164
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm so full.

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,200
I'd never imagined I'd be able to eat this big for 350 yen.

166
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,260
Yeah, me and Ryo ate the same amount.

167
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,460
So, the price is half of it.

168
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,180
It's all thanks to you, Ryo.

169
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,800
You're right. You're a genius when it comes to saving money.

170
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,540
Call me a shopkeeper.

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,740
There's nothing that won't be cheap if I work for you.

172
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,760
You should consult me when you buy a house, Terai.

173
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
I'm sure you bought that house after consulting the director, Ohara.

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,880
Yes. The director is the one who knows about real estate in the Katsushika book.

175
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,400
I heard he's called the "real estate demon."

176
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,000
The real estate demon?

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,440
That's right. He's been working for seven hours.

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
It's wrong to consult the director.

179
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,520
The director can't buy a whole bunch of daikon.

180
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,980
You can't buy a house for someone like him.

181
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,340
Now, let's get to work.

182
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,820
Oh, no. That document...

183
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,940
What's wrong? What's wrong with you two?

184
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,720
Director! Welcome!

185
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,140
You sound like you're going to say something big.

186
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,540
No, I'm just saying what I think as a professional shopkeeper.

187
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,960
A professional shopkeeper?

188
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,600
The real estate market is different from a normal shop.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,780
It's not as easy as you think.

190
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,220
Why not? It's the same as making money.

191
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,920
I see. Then, let me ask you something.

192
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
Do you fully understand the real estate law?

193
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,680
The real estate law?

194
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,940
Do you know the term "property?

195
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,780
If it's a contract of a different price, you need to know the law.

196
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,260
W- what's that?

197
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,440
The Real Estate Law.

198
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,040
The Real Estate Trade Law.

199
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:32,420
The Real Estate Law.

200
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,580
The Real Estate Law.

201
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,400
What about the law regarding the property of a building, ownership, and so on?

202
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,720
The law concerning the contract for borrowing, renting, and renting.

203
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,300
The law concerning the contract for borrowing, renting, and renting.

204
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,380
The law concerning the contract for borrowing, renting, and renting.

205
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,160
The law concerning the contract for borrowing, renting, and renting.

206
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:52,960
You're being ridiculous!

207
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't need that sort of ridiculous law!

208
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,180
What's that ridiculous thing?

209
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,220
What kind of thing do you know about a family that hasn't ever bought a house?

210
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,020
If you don't know, what do you know?

211
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,980
I know!

212
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,900
The chief lives in the outskirts of Chiba.

213
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,320
I chose my house because of the environment.

214
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,020
Then the house of the priest is also the environment?

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
There was no other suitable property.

216
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,140
It's a bad way to look for it.

217
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,040
Then do you say you can look for it?

218
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,960
I'll find a house that's more luxurious and convenient to commute than the chief.

219
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,060
Interesting.

220
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,520
Then, after a week,

221
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,980
let's take you to the house you looked for.

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm looking forward to it.

223
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,840
What if we can't find it?

224
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,420
Then what?

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,620
We'll take you around Tokyo naked.

226
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,060
What?

227
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,320
We'll meet a week later.

228
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,060
Deal?

229
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,620
Yeah!

230
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,660
Ryo, are you okay?

231
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,840
You promised.

232
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,880
I'd be happy if I could find a house more luxurious.

233
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm a professional at shopping.

234
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,760
Don't worry.

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,100
Oh, thank you very much.

236
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,260
That's all right.

237
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,400
Come on!

238
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,740
Now take a look at this store.

239
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,920
I often do commercials on TV.

240
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,820
It's sweet!

241
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,300
This kind of big real estate is the same as a department store!

242
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,200
There are luxury products and branded products,

243
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,120
but there are surprisingly few for the common people.

244
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
And above all, the ingredients are in a bad condition.

245
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,920
I see.

246
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,880
The target is the corner of the shopping street,

247
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,460
and it seems that it has been doing it for a long time and the store seems to collapse.

248
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,120
It seems that it is not collapsed!

249
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,660
It's good!

250
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,640
What?

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,540
There's something we can find out about that place.

252
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,860
Let's go, Terai.

253
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,100
What do you mean, "we still have one contract this month"?

254
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,900
But we have a good property.

255
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,740
We can sell it there, but we need to be good at business.

256
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,740
Business is a game.

257
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
We need to know how to get the right people at the right time.

258
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,800
Chief, you look like a customer.

259
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,040
Huh?

260
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,420
All right, leave it to them.

261
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,340
I'll make sure they sign the contract.

262
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,340
Smile, smile.

263
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,900
Welcome.

264
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,420
Welcome to Seijitsu real estate, where we answer your needs honestly.

265
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm...

266
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,040
I've been a Seijitsu employee for 40 years.

267
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,520
I'm Hanyu Pochiro, the store's sales manager.

268
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,760
What kind of property are you looking for?

269
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:36,980
How much do you want?

270
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,460
I want a $25 million house in Tokyo, about an hour and a half away from Tokyo.

271
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,280
You're buying from this guy, huh?

272
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,640
He's easy to fall for.

273
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,100
Then...

274
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,740
Wait!

275
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,160
Then I can't make the manager yell at me.

276
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,700
The $15 million is an hour away from Tokyo.

277
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,900
That's annoying.

278
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,020
Sir, you're lucky.

279
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,540
Actually, it's just been completed, and there's a property that hasn't even been advertised yet.

280
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,980
It's only an hour away from Tokyo, and the price is $3 million.

281
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,100
What?

282
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,880
I've been trying to be honest, but I can't do that for other stores.

283
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,920
This is definitely better than Chief Ohara's house.

284
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,280
It's a great thing to look for.

285
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,540
I'll sign this contract right away.

286
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,620
Y-Yes.

287
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,140
I'll sign it.

288
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,740
Wait a minute!

289
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,640
What's wrong, Ryo?

290
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,660
From my experience, there is no store that suddenly offers the best products to its first customer.

291
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,280
There must be more properties than that.

292
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,220
Giku!

293
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,140
What are you talking about?

294
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,080
Even if it's the first customer, they will offer the best property.

295
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,960
That's the reason why this store is so honest.

296
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,180
That's right.

297
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,320
There are so many properties that are so well-known.

298
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,280
I found a better picture than the manager, so it's okay.

299
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
But I don't like to buy with a good price.

300
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,320
I may have to negotiate.

301
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,860
This is bad.

302
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,240
Oops!

303
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:03,740
It's a mess!

304
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,600
Yes, this is Seijitsu Real Estate.

305
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,520
Thank you very much.

306
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,160
Excuse me.

307
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,020
What?

308
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,860
Is that the property?

309
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,560
Please wait a moment.

310
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,940
I'm in trouble!

311
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,820
Someone called me to buy that property right away.

312
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,800
What?

313
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,940
What should I do?

314
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,460
If you don't give me a good price, I'll sign a contract with you right away.

315
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Okay, I'll sign it right away.

316
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,300
Ryo, give it back to me.

317
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,640
Contract completed.

318
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,820
I'm really sorry.

319
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,980
It's just sold now.

320
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm really sorry.

321
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,560
Excuse me.

322
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,300
Yes.

323
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,940
What is it?

324
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,560
The ink on the pen seems to have run out.

325
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,900
Hey, Tsukamoto.

327
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,560
It's a pen.

328
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,640
Hurry up and get a pen.

329
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,380
Pen, pen, pen.

330
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,660
Yes.

331
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,580
That's not a good way to rush.

332
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,560
Show me again.

333
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,100
Yes.

334
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,780
It's a pen.

335
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Pen, pen.

336
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,620
Let's sign it right away.

337
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,100
Let's do it.

338
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,660
3.0 points?

339
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,580
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,400
It's 30 points, Ryo.

341
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
There's no way there's such a small house.

342
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,800
There's no way there's such a small house.

343
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,220
Don't worry.

345
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,220
Hey, what's this?

346
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,060
There are times when the ink stains the documents.

347
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,920
Hey, you're thinking too much, Ryo.

348
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,140
Then I'll ask you just in case.

349
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,840
How many pots is this house?

350
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,680
Yes.

351
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,440
It's in the documents.

352
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,240
Yes.

353
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,820
I'm asking you how many pots.

354
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,380
As you can see.

355
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,680
Well, you can't say how many pots?

356
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,480
Ryo, why are you so innocent?

357
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not that kind of person.

358
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
Don't you realize, Terai?

359
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
I don't say a word in my own mouth.

360
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,220
Well, you're right.

361
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,820
Ryo.

362
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,620
You're suspicious.

363
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,700
If you can't say how many pots there are, show me the real thing.

364
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
If you're going on a trip, you'll be taken by someone else.

365
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,720
Don't say nonsense and take me there right away.

366
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,720
Yes.

367
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,340
How is it?

368
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,500
This is it! This wonderful land, this shining view!

369
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,360
There is no other place in the capital that can be found with more of these things.

370
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,600
So, how do humans live?

371
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,120
Do they have to live on a micro-aircraft?

372
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,700
Are they really 3.0 tons?

373
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,580
That was dangerous. I almost got tricked.

374
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,580
That's true.

375
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,900
There is no way to trick people.

376
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,520
I'm so jealous that you have such a toy house!

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,460
I don't call it a human house.

378
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
This is a pet house.

379
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,360
Pet?

380
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,120
In the pet industry these days,

381
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,620
there are more and more people who want a luxury pet house

382
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,560
than in the traditional dog house.

383
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,160
You're quite suspicious.

384
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,000
When I first saw you,

385
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,820
I thought you were a pet enthusiast.

386
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm really, really sorry.

387
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,220
I'm sorry.

388
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,220
I would like to offer you a high-cost pre-paid property

390
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,560
at a legitimate price of 50% .

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,340
Please, let me have a pet.

392
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,440
We need you to show me the real deal.

393
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,420
Don't do that.

394
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,880
Next time, I will make sure you sign up for my pet.

395
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,620
Look.

396
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,060
That is your house.

397
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,660
It is a good house.

398
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:40,820
It's not a house.

399
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,980
How much is it?

400
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,720
It's usually about 20 million yen, but...

401
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,140
The price is 8.5 million yen.

402
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,760
Really?

403
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,880
To be honest, if you offer it at such a low price, the company will be in trouble.

404
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,900
However...

405
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,240
The company's motto is "Seligitsu"

406
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,040
My motto is "Seligitsu"

407
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,100
"Seligitsu" is written as "Jitsu"

408
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,620
To overcome the "Seligitsu", a little trouble is more than enough.

409
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,820
"Seligitsu" is here!

410
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,920
Let's make a contract before other customers know.

411
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,160
Yes.

412
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,240
It's working.

413
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,260
What's going on?

414
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,360
Show me closer.

415
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,300
I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. Stop it. Stop it.

416
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,300
Why can't you do it?

417
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,980
You're hiding something again.

418
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,960
I can't do it!

419
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,220
Well...

420
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,260
What?

421
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,180
What?

422
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,540
What?

423
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,320
You can't live in a house like this!

424
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,440
It's ridiculous.

425
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,380
I can really live in a house like this.

426
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,820
Now we have a Japanese-style room, a kitchen, and a bathroom.

427
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,060
It's like a eel's sleeping place.

428
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,300
Do you sleep vertically?

429
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,620
It's too big.

430
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,940
How big is the house?

431
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,380
We have to match the size of the house.

432
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,980
We're in a big, calm bathroom.

433
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,960
But we have to take it inside the swimming pool to go to the next room!

434
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,860
It's enough!

435
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,880
We're in the next room.

436
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,780
Don't worry.

437
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,920
We have many of them.

438
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,700
There must be something that customers like.

439
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,960
What a quiet place.

440
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,700
But next...

441
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,600
What do you think of this wide entrance?

442
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,060
Next!

443
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,380
Next!

444
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,220
This is the dining kitchen that has been sought after for the day of the day.

445
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
This is the bathroom.

446
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,880
How is this bright Japanese-style room?

447
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,100
This house is 15 million yen at a fair price.

448
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,840
The price of the city hall is a price of price.

449
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,100
This won't be a problem for the chief's house, Ryo-san.

450
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,620
There's an earthquake.

451
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,120
Hey! Is there anyone who can close the apartment during an earthquake?

452
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,480
Open it right away!

453
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,680
What? You're going to open it?

454
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,460
Get out of the way! I'll open it!

455
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,880
I can't! I'll open it!

456
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,480
You're in the way!

457
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,920
Wait a minute!

458
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,020
Well, you're hiding something again!

459
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,900
It's my imagination.

460
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,480
I'll give you a good one!

461
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,420
Ryo-san!

462
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,180
This house is floating in the sea!

463
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,520
It's cheap because it doesn't cost a lot of money.

464
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,840
It's pretty stylish, isn't it?

465
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,700
If there's a typhoon, it'll be a mess!

466
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,180
The next property is okay.

467
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,300
It's cheap because it doesn't cost a lot of money.

468
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,960
There's no way I can live in a place like this!

469
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm going to feel bad.

470
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,120
Please make it yourself.

471
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,420
It's cheap without the human resources.

472
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,920
Well...

473
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,200
Ryo-san, give up already.

474
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,660
After all, a house better than the chief's house is not something you can imagine.

475
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,540
If I give up, I'll lose!

476
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,460
I can't afford to be a big help to the chief anymore!

477
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,420
Hey!

478
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,500
If this happens, I'll close my eyes to the majority!

479
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,080
Find a better house than this!

480
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,780
Are you really going to close your eyes to the majority?

481
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Yeah!

482
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,080
Then leave everything to me!

483
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,280
I'll close my eyes to the majority!

484
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,940
I'll close my eyes to the majority!

485
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:34,960
I'll close my eyes to the majority!

486
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,780
This is our secret property.

487
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,520
There is no other house in the Tokyo Kinko.

488
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,640
That's good, Terai.

489
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,740
It's a better house than the chief's house.

490
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,540
Yeah.

491
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm a little worried about the bad sunlight.

492
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,240
It's not a small thing!

493
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,580
The sun doesn't hit at all.

494
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,600
Why is there a house in the basement?

495
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,820
Because it doesn't cost a lot of money.

496
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,180
Other than the sun, all houses in this house are better.

497
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,640
That's not the problem!

498
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,300
Besides, this is convenient for commuting.

499
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,980
It takes only one second to get to the station.

500
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,500
It's connected to the home, so it doesn't cost a lot of money.

501
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,320
In addition, there is no gas, water, electricity, or telephone.

502
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
It's a straight line.

503
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,420
Then it's illegal!

504
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,280
Even if it's illegal, it's better than the chief's house.

505
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,660
You!

506
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,660
You!

507
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,160
You're a policeman!

508
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,420
Chief!

509
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,020
Even if you say that,

510
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,460
why don't you accept my defeat?

511
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,460
I'll beat you up again!

512
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,940
What about your contract?

513
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,340
I'm not going anywhere!

514
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,140
What's this smell?

515
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,140
Chief, it's okay.

516
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,280
I like this place.

517
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,720
I bought this thing.

518
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,300
What?

519
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,880
Is it real?

520
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,900
Yes.

521
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,520
Well, both Lloyd and the chief should stop fighting

522
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,880
and let's have a cup of tea.

523
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm gonna put my tea in.

524
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,600
What do you want?

525
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,300
Who are you?

526
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,140
Come!

527
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,600
Hey, Ryo!

528
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,360
Huh?

529
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
What?

530
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,540
He's not here.

531
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,400
You really can't find a house!

532
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,640
I bet you had a better house than the chief.

533
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,740
I hope you're satisfied.

534
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,700
Please sign the contract.

535
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,160
But it's already broken.

536
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
No, no.

537
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,180
But you said you liked it, didn't you?

538
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,840
But...

539
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,540
Here's the signature.

540
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,520
Please!

541
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,920
Wait!

542
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,340
The outside of the house is already broken!

00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,420
Don't say that!

544
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,380
Sign it!

545
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,760
What is this land cell?

546
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,180
It has a navigation system, a computer, and a video camera.

547
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,020
Do you have a normal notebook or a boat box like a elementary school student?

548
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,780
But I want this land cell too.

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,980
Next time, Hyper Elementary School Student vs. Ryo-tsu.

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,880

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:02,580
Even if it rains, tomorrow will be sunny

553
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,660
Bye bye, let's wave our hands

554
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,780
Say goodbye to the unpleasant things

555
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,620
Oh yeah, let's live the way we like

556
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,580
There's something good

557
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:29,940
The sun is calling outside the door
