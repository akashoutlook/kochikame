00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,280
"When watching TV"

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,060
When watching TV

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,120
Make the room bright and look away

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,500
I look at the sunset that floats in the river

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,860
I look at the sunset that floats in the river

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,920
When I kick a pebble, it flies to my shoes

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,280
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I was working out

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,260
I was laughed at as it was

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,480
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I was working out

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,520
Even this year, the cityscape that will never change

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,980
Even this year, the cityscape that will never change

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,420
Is strangely gentle

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,740
From the fountain of Tongari-boshi

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:16,680
To Kaishakuten, the sunset is falling

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,480
To Kaishakuten, the sunset is falling

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,380
And it's over

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,900
Even if I lose my happiness

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,700
I'll be fine

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,420
I'm a fool

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,440
"Ton Demo Koukuu Keisetsutai"

21
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,580
"Ton Demo Koukuu Keisetsutai"

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:45,760
"Ton Demo Koukuu Keisetsutai"

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,680
"Nakagawa"

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,380
"Nakagawa"

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,360
"Nakagawa"

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,460
"Kashu dispenser"

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
"Kashu dispenser"

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,120
What do I need to do?

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,820
"It's okay to move, right?"

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,620
Let's see

31
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,380
"It's okay to move, right?"

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,040
"It's okay to move, right?"

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,120
" laptop"

34
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:22,460
"Aerop TS-404"

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,460
Demorganized

36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:40,840
Another shows up. The cash dispenser thief.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,800
The one who used the similar plane,

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
this is his fifth time.

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,080
It's other people's money.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,000
It's none of my business at all.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,340
Well, this is your business, eh?

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,380
Good morning, chief!

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,860
Good morning.

44
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,060
What's going on, chief?

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,760
You said you had something to do with Senpai?

46
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,500
Actually, to solve this case,

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,260
we have formed an Air Police Force.

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,300
Air... Police Force?

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,620
Air Police, right?

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,740
Air Police?

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,080
It's been around since the U.S.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,820
They use helicopters as a helicopter.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,660
I've seen that in movies.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,920
You were recommended by the chief of the Air Police Force.

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,420
What?

56
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,600
This is the recommendation form.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,940
That's amazing, isn't it, Gyo-chan?

58
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,560
The chief of the Air Police Force?

59
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,640
Me? The chief?

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
I see.

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,440
So you finally recognized my excellence as the chief of the police force.

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,120
I think it's just a human error.

63
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,880
Who recommended Senpai?

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,400
The chief of the Air Police Force

65
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,200
is a technical expert.

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,220
I don't know much about him.

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
I've seen him somewhere before.

68
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,320
This is the map of the Air Police Force headquarters.

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,380
You have to follow it.

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,840
Chief, are you worried about me?

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,260
No. I just don't want you to come back here again.

72
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,880
Hmph!

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,060
I'm sure you're right.

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,880
What on earth is this map?

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,320
There's a mark on the bridge.

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,560
I can't believe there's an Air Police Force here.

77
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,360
I've got a bad feeling about this.

78
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,620
Huh?

79
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,260
Wh-What?

80
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,440
I-Is this the headquarters?

81
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,820
The greatest genius of the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci,

82
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,040
was inspired by the Italian Borgia family

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,660
and created numerous works of art and inventions.

84
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,320
I can't believe this voice.

85
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,200
No way.

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,380
I didn't make it practical,

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,660
but there are many designs of airplanes.

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,680
Let's bring them back to the present!

89
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,400
Ciao. Long time no see, Gorilla-kun.

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,500
It's you, Professor Ezaki!

91
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,780
Huh?

92
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,500
Then who recommended me as the chief of the Air Police Force?

93
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,920
It's me.

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,260
I knew it.

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,060
Hey, are there any other members?

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,100
Are they still here?

97
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,160
I think they're all here.

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,700
Then, I knew it.

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,860
The Air Police Force in Japan starts with you and me.

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,740
Kairu!

101
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,340
I'm sorry to be alone with you!

102
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,440
Wait, Gorilla-kun!

103
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,180
We're still two members.

104
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,300
If we improve our performance,

105
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,000
the Air Police Force will grow bigger and bigger.

106
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,160
We'll have ten, twenty, and a hundred more members.

107
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,880
We'll have ten, twenty, and a hundred more members.

108
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,060
We'll have ten, twenty, and a hundred more members.

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,740
You'll be at the top of that.

110
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,040
The top of ten thousand?

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,040
Will the pay rise?

112
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,360
Of course.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
It's twice, three, no, ten times.

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,680
What?

115
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,200
Come to think of it,

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm the only one who can do such a difficult job.

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,900
Oh, you'll do it for me?

118
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,400
Yeah.

119
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,700
Let's protect the sky of Japan together.

120
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,700
Let's protect the sky of Japan together.

121
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:03,920
Let's protect the sky of Japan together.

122
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,240
Let's protect the sky of Japan together.

123
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,280
Let's protect the sky of Japan together.

124
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,400
Let's protect the sky of Japan together.

125
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,580
So, this is the most important airplane?

126
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,280
So, this is the most important airplane?

127
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,280
Don't worry.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,480
I've calculated the resistance to the wind.

129
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,980
That's not the problem.

130
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,140
We can't fly it like this.

131
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
What are you talking about?

132
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,000
I made this with the design of Leonardo da Vinci.

133
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,780
I made this with the design of Leonardo da Vinci.

134
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,740
It's called "Leonardo Ezaki No. 1:

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,200
A combination of Italian genius and modern Japanese genius of the Renaissance period.

136
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,740
It can't fly.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Did you take a test flight?

138
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,880
You can fly if you have confidence.

139
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,360
You can fly if you have confidence.

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,180
Of course.

141
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,700
Then, let me fly it again.

142
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,220
No, I can't.

143
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,920
It's time for a siesta.

144
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,280
Siesta?

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,060
In Italy, we have a habit of taking a nap after lunch.

146
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,760
If you work hard, you can't get great ideas.

147
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,080
So, that's why...

148
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,820
Good night.

149
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,460
Stop fooling around!

150
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,480
Stop fooling around and go for a test flight.

151
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,660
Hey!

152
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,220
What?

153
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,340
W-what's going on?

154
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm an experimental team?

155
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,140
Fly, Leonardo Ezaki No. 1!

156
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,580
No!

157
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,000
No!

158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,440
No!

159
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,880
No!

160
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,300
No!

161
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,940
No!

162
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,180
No, no!

163
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,140
I told you, you can't fly.

164
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,420
I thought it would be simple if you had the power.

165
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,480
It wasn't there, due to the structure.

166
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,760
If you know how to fly, then don't make one from the start.

167
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,180
But, don't worry.

168
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,380
What you catch a plane is not just this one.

169
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,660
What's this?

170
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,080
It's the design of Leonardo da Vinci.

171
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,460
I made it with my own design.

172
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,220
It's called the model of the current helicopter.

173
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,020
There's a proper helicopter now, right?

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,100
Just in case, I'll ask you, but did you take the test flight properly?

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,420
Well, how was it?

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
Don't fool around!

177
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,100
Oh, it's time for siesta.

178
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
I did siesta just now.

179
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,640
You're a man who cares about the details.

180
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,300
You'll be hated in Italy.

181
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,340
This is Japan.

182
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,600
Don't say anything and go on the test flight.

183
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,180
Burn the pedals!

184
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,740
Fly, Leonardo Ezaki No. 2!

185
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,220
After all, Leonardo Da Vinci was born on an airplane.

186
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,380
He was a man 400 years ago.

187
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,460
It's impossible to make an actual airplane.

188
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,960
If you knew, don't make it from the beginning!

189
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,420
But don't worry. There are still more airplanes.

190
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,020
What is this hut?

191
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,460
It's the secret storage room of the Air Police.

192
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,320
What's the secret?

193
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,060
If you put your skin in it, you have to cross the bridge to move.

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,140
Don't worry, look at this.

195
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,320
This is the secret storage room of the Air Police.

196
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm surprised.

197
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,740
This is called the "Leonardo Ezaki No. 3."

198
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,640
From just now, there are only manned airplanes.

199
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,900
The Air Police has just made it, so there is still little budget.

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,420
But this time, it seems to be flying.

201
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,100
Did you make this based on the design of Leonardo Da Vinci?

202
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,800
No, that was the idea of the "Surprised Chicken Human Contest."

203
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,240
Then you don't have to put "Leonardo" on it.

204
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,460
If you care about the details, you will be hated in Italy.

205
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,260
That's why I say this is Japan!

206
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,920
This time, the test flight is...

207
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,760
It was useless just to ask.

208
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,660
Anyway, I'll try it.

209
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,260
Finished!

210
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,600
No!

211
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,580
There is no meat inside!

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,680
No meat inside!!

213
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,880
Maybe I forgot to tell you...

214
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,540
The price is also a point, isn't it?

215
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:48,800
There is no meat inside.

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,160
Listen!

217
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,840
What!?

218
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,080
What?!

219
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,620
I'm going to burn!

220
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:01,320
Y-you did it! It flew!

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,120
Don't tell me it really flew!

222
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
It's like it turned into a bird!

223
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,220
What's that?

224
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,480
It's an Akihito, right?

225
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,540
Hey, Nakagawa! This is bad!

226
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,840
It's the third Asahi-style Akihito!

227
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,480
Roger that!

228
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,740
It's coming!

229
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,520
Stop the motorcycle there! Stop it!

230
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,420
Why did you find out? Damn it!

231
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,540
Oh no!

232
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,300
The criminal's motorcycle is heading to the third intersection!

233
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,720
Wait a minute!

234
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
It's on the side road again!

235
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,560
It's a guy who knows the back road well.

236
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,940
I might be able to escape from here.

237
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,880
If this continues, I'll...

238
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,440
You can't catch me with a motorcycle!

239
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,860
Wait a minute!

240
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,200
I'll arrest you!

241
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,780
You're a pain in the ass!

242
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,940
Senpai!

243
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,060
We did it! The Air Police Division has been performing well since day one!

244
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,500
Senpai, you can catch the cash dispenser thief at this rate!

245
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,480
Leave it to me!

246
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,840
But where is the plane you were on?

247
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
It's already there!

248
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,200
There's nothing to be surprised about.

249
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,100
That plane perfectly copied the record of the amazing bird contest.

250
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,300
It's flying to the ends of the earth.

251
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,080
But that's the ocean!

252
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,480
You should give up already.

253
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,240
I think we should get a new one.

254
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,400
What?

255
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,700
What a decent plane!

256
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,780
The Air Police Division

257
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:50,840
The Air Police Division

258
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,300
The Air Police Division

259
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,360
The Air Police Division

260
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,860
The Air Police Division

261
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,140
The criminal has been arrested.

262
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,220
It's time to show the power of the Air Police Division.

263
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,660
So, what have you done so far?

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Look at this.

265
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,460
The Air Police Division

266
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,840
The Air Police Division

267
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:16,920
The Air Police Division

268
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,480
The Air Police Division

269
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
The Air Police Division

270
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,920
The Air Police Division

271
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,400
The Air Police Division

272
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,620
The Air Police Division

273
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,300
The Air Police Division

274
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,080
The Air Police Division

275
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,840
The Air Police Division

276
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,820
The Air Police Division

277
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,760
The Air Police Division

278
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,420
The Air Police Division

279
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,980
The Air Police Division

280
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,100
The Air Police Division

281
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,060
The Air Police Division

282
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:43,460
The Air Police Division

283
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm aiming for a plane that's gentle to the environment.

284
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,660
That's why I made this plane move with electricity.

285
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,180
But there's one flaw.

286
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,320
Flaw?

287
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,320
It takes a lot of time to charge.

288
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,820
It takes about five hours.

289
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,980
Charge it from the beginning!

290
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,720
Then, let's get the siesta before the charging is over.

291
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,500
Ouch, good night.

292
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,480
You're a good sleeper.

293
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,400
*snoring*

294
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,420
It's already evening.

295
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,280
Get up!

296
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,280
It's a refreshing awakening.

297
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,640
Beautiful.

298
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,760
What a beautiful morning.

299
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,440
It's a sunset.

300
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,380
If you care about small things, you'll be hated in Italy.

301
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm telling you, this is Japan!

302
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,380
The charging is almost over.

303
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,460
Which one?

304
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,300
Hmm, looks good.

305
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,380
Then, let's go for a drive.

306
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,840
Huh?

307
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,200
Is this plane a double seat?

308
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah.

309
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,680
I put two engines on it, and it just put two seats on it.

310
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,840
I see.

311
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:53,880
What?

312
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
No way...

313
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,120
There are two seats.

314
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,640
Let's get on it together.

315
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm sorry, but I have to get the data from outside.

316
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,300
You can get the accurate data if you get on it.

317
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,060
It's siesta time.

318
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,100
I have to sleep.

319
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,860
I slept a lot until just now.

320
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
Or are you not confident in the plane you made?

321
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,380
I can't help you.

322
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,500
My plane is perfect.

323
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,680
Then, get on it.

324
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,520
*snoring*

325
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,080
I can't help you, Gorilla.

326
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,480
You really are a strong guy.

327
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,820
Well, let's go.

328
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,000
Engine start!

329
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,300
*sir*

330
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,460
*sir*

331
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,000
*sir*

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,780
*sir*

333
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,080
*sir*

334
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,600
*sir*

335
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,280
*sir*

336
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,760
*sir*

337
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,880
*sir*

338
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,240
*sir*

339
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
*sir*

340
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,700
*sir*

341
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,400
*sir*

342
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,560
In that case, let's start!

343
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,240
*sir*

344
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,120
limits...

345
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,000
...

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,620
*sir*

347
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,020
*sir*

348
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,900
*sir*

349
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,140
*sir*

350
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,400
*sir*

351
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
*sir*

352
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,060
*sir*

353
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
We're already at Snow Mountain.

354
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,720
You're getting much happier than when you first came here.

355
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,480
One off, two off...

356
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,820
Have you got a 높dorfer's memory?

357
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,100
I can't even say that as a joke.

358
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,600
Hey, you're in all the danger!

359
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,260
Nothing can scare me!

360
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,000
Subscribe!

361
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,760
Well, now you know that I'm not a coward or something, right?

362
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,640
Even though you were fainted!

363
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,180
Hm? What's that sound?

364
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,740
It's a power outage. The electricity's gone.

365
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,940
Hey, wait! It hasn't even been 5 minutes since it took off!

366
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,960
If you fully charge this plane for 5 hours, it can fly for 5 minutes.

367
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,500
Then it's useless!

368
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,140
Don't worry, Gorilla-kun! It's for this kind of situation!

369
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,560
For this kind of situation!

370
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,400
Wh- what's that?!

371
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Step on the pedal! That's how you charge it!

372
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,960
What?!

373
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,840
-Get on it already! -I know!

374
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,100
I did it! It's a success!

375
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,420
This is no different from a manned airplane!

376
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,680
It's no different from a manned aircraft!

377
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,020
-Set complete. -Roger.

378
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,100
You're playing in the middle of the night?

379
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,040
I-it can't be! That's...

380
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,820
It's a special flight with a cash register!

381
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,680
I think we've got a lot of stuff in today's plane.

382
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,540
Japanese police can't even move their hands or legs when they run into the sky.

383
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,760
It's a piece of cake!

384
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,680
Wait!

385
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,600
Huh? Did you hear something just now?

386
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
No way, it's above the sky!

387
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,680
Wait up!

388
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,900
Whoa!

389
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:37,740
It's the Air Police!

390
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,680
We're going to arrest them for the murder of a cash register!

391
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,220
I-I can't believe there's an Air Police in Japan!

392
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,340
We're running away!

393
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,080
I know!

394
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,600
We're not running away!

395
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,880
Hey, speed up! They're going to catch up!

396
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,240
The cash register is too heavy!

397
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,180
Don't you dare! You can't run away with that kind of stuff!

398
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,640
Damn it!

399
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,400
Damn it! Damn it!

400
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,900
Take this!

401
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm still here!

402
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,740
Here! Take this!

403
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,880
What a quiet guy!

404
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,920
If this happens...

405
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,980
This isn't funny.

406
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:56,640
I'll get you for this!

407
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,940
S-true...

408
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,960
We'll get you for this!

409
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,380
We've been going through the same kicks...

410
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,060
That's how it's going to go.

411
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,660
Are you crazy?

412
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,080
If you don't leave now, the world will be on our hands.

413
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,220
You'll see!

414
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,400
I'll get you, too!

415
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,480
The End

416
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,780
Ah, there's a hole!

417
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,800
This is why the cloth-based wings are troublesome!

418
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,760
It's okay.

419
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,440
This is also a matter of fact.

420
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,660
I have prepared spare cloth.

421
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,120
What?

422
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,060
Then, I'll sew it up,

423
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
so I'll leave the control over there to you.

424
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,700
Eh, me?

425
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
Who else is there?

426
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
Or are you going to sew it up for me?

427
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,420
Hahaha!

428
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,840
I'll leave such a delicious role to you.

429
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,880
I'll do the back part.

430
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,060
It's okay to just hold the control and step on the pedals.

431
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,980
Don't do unnecessary things.

432
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,180
Hmm.

433
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,600
It's a pity that I can't show my brilliant control technique,

434
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,900
but I can't help it.

435
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,920
Hahaha!

436
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,080
It's really hard to do.

437
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,900
Ah!

438
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,500
Ah!

439
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,800
Ouch!

440
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,440
What are you doing suddenly?

441
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,000
A-a little...

442
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,100
A little...

443
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,840
It's a test of performance.

444
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,740
Hahaha!

445
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,000
Damn it!

446
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,560
The cloth fell!

447
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,660
Don't you have any other spare cloth?

448
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,540
Ah!

449
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,520
What did you say?

450
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,080
Ah!

451
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,700
Ah!

452
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,440
It really fell!

453
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,340
Eh?

454
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,980
What happened?

455
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,060
Oh no!

456
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,080
It's not enough yet!

457
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,220
Damn it!

458
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,620
How about this?

459
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,560
Ah...

460
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,440
Ah!

461
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,600
It's going to crash!

462
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Ah!

463
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,180
It's going to crash!

464
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,680
I can't trust this guy!

465
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,860
He is really useless.

466
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,920
Deuuh!

467
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,780
Ah!

468
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,920
Uhh, we're in trouble now.

469
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,560
It's time for you to appear in front of the acrobat.

470
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm just Gosh!

471
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,060
Hm?

472
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,560
All right!

473
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,400
Are you all right, thinking like you are now?

474
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,920
Good!

475
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,060
I'll just smash it from above at once!

476
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,140
I'll get you!

477
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:07,120
Let's go, you pervert!

478
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,920
What?

479
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,080
The moon is very blue!

480
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,660
If you look at the pattern,

481
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,760
a perverted man was flying.

482
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,160
The moon is the moon, right?

483
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
It's also Venus!

484
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm back!

485
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,940
Why are you guys coming out?

486
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,820
And don't stand in the air!

487
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,800
It's too natural!

488
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,700
I don't think I'm feeling well tonight.

489
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,740
I have a strange illusion.

490
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,080
It's reality!

491
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,840
Oh, no!

492
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,280
The escape device!

493
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,220
Sorry, Gorilla!

494
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,200
I'll take care of the rest!

495
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,140
You're irresponsible!

496
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,500
That perverted man!

497
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,220
I'll arrest you for being a pervert!

498
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,160
Wait, it's me!

499
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,280
Don't you remember me?

500
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,360
A pervert who was flying in a full tank!

501
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,800
You know it, right?

502
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm not a pervert!

503
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,220
You didn't tell me!

504
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,480
I'll take care of the moon!

505
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,940
Wait!

506
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,820
I'll let you go!

507
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,540
It's a shame

508
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,100
that I couldn't steal the dispenser.

509
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,520
You managed to escape.

510
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,440
What?

511
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
The pervert has been arrested!

512
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,740
The mission is complete!

513
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,640
Wait! I'm a pervert!

514
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
Wait! I'm a pervert!

515
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,560
What's going to happen to the Air Police?

516
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,540
It's all over.

517
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,460
But the cash dispenser robbery

518
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,820
was arrested, right?

519
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,700
Yes.

520
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,760
But the perverts who flew in the sky

521
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,400
don't need a second team.

522
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,180
So we're going to make

523
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,340
the underground police force.

524
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,100
Now, Gorilla,

525
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,380
let's make the underground police force bigger.

526
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,420
The peace on the ground

527
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,140
is in our hands.

528
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,580
Shut up!

529
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,700
What crime will happen

530
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:58,920
in such a place?

531
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,220
The End

532
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,200
The End

533
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,280
The End

534
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,200
The End

535
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,820
The End

536
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,440
The End

537
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,880
The End

538
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,380
The End

539
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,940
The End

540
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,120
The End

541
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,600
The End

542
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,940
The End

543
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,680
The End

544
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,260
The End

545
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,080
The End

546
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,140
The End

547
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,600
The End

548
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,300
The End

549
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,720
The End

550
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,980
The End

551
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,360
The End

552
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,580
The End

553
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,220
The End

554
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,540
The End

555
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,040
The End

556
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,580
The End

557
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,060
The End

558
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,900
I'm a monk!

559
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm still embarrassed!

560
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,100
Since the police officer's death,

561
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:25,920
I've been a monk!

562
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,980
I've never arrested a criminal!

563
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,700
But now,

564
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,260
the time has finally come to

565
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,600
use my hands!

566
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,600
Next time on

567
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
"The First Monk's Experience as a Monk!"

568
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,780
Thank you for watching!
