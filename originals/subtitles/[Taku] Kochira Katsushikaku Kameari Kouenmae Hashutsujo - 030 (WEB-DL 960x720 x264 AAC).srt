Yes, we are offering free print seals to the customers who have made a special offer at our store.

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,080
Ryo, let's go play the "Hina Matsuri" winning game.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,020
I hate March 3rd!

30
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,860
Get out of my way!

31
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,160
What's wrong with Ryo?

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,740
Let's light the candles.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,100
I see. Today was the "Hina Matsuri".

34
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,140
Yes. Isn't it cute?

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,680
It seems that the "Hina Matsuri" is a happy thing for girls no matter how old they are.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,240
Good morning.

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,040
Good morning.

38
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,440
What's wrong with Ryo?

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,020
He went on a patrol.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,140
A patrol?

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,740
He must be playing around somewhere.

42
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,720
Ryo doesn't seem to be interested in the festival.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,660
Even if it's a festival, it's a "Hina Matsuri" today.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,960
It has nothing to do with men like Ryo.

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,360
Who did it?

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,880
It's Ryo, as I thought.

47
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,500
This is strange.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,320
What's wrong, chief?

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
It's a great discovery. Look.

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,480
Here it is.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,720
March 3rd?

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,880
It's Ryo's...

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
It's Ryo's birthday.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,120
That means it's today.

55
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,900
It means...

56
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,720
Ryo's birthday is a "Hina Matsuri"?

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,580
Oh, no!

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,220
Ryo's image doesn't match at all.

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,160
It's impossible to say that you're laughing.

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,000
What's wrong, chief?

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,940
It's the local police chief, Ryo.

62
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,640
I see.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,000
Good morning, chief.

64
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,460
I was on patrol to be able to protect the safety of the local residents.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,480
I see.

66
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,880
I see.

67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,740
Of course, the chief of the police probably took it with him.

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,040
That's already a very important thing in his pocket.

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,420
That's strange.

70
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,340
Did you put it here?

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,140
See. It fell off.

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,960
Oh, thank you.

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,500
You're welcome.

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,360
By the way, isn't today someone's birthday?

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,460
What?

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Who was it?

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,680
Oh, it was the temple.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,540
It's May 5th.

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,920
It's a boy's birthday.

80
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Oh, that's a good birthday for a boy.

81
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,300
Right, Ryoatsu?

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,460
Well, yeah.

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,540
Reiko's birthday is...

84
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,680
July 7th.

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,920
Oh, it's a festival.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,020
A festival?

87
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,340
It's a good day to be romantic like a girl.

88
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,820
Right, Ryoatsu?

89
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,320
Yeah.

90
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,140
But there are days when you can be more romantic like a girl.

91
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,940
For example...

92
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,720
March 3rd!

93
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,660
You said it was a festival!

94
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,280
I knew it!

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,140
It's my birthday on March 3rd!

96
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,300
Oh, I didn't know that.

97
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,080
I knew it.

98
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,060
Don't worry about it.

99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,340
It's a boy's birthday on March 3rd.

100
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,100
It's a boy who's so romantic.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
I just didn't like his image.

102
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,100
I don't mind that.

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
But a boy's birthday is not something you want to do every year.

104
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,660
At first, yeah.

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,360
I was in elementary school.

106
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,480
I tried to make a doll for a girl in my neighborhood.

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,520
And I found a cardboard doll in the stairs.

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,980
I slipped

109
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,100
He slipped and fell down a terrible staircase.

110
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,140
Oh my.

111
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,620
When he was in middle school, he drank white alcohol and got drunk.

112
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,820
He fell into a river and was washed into the sea.

113
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,320
When he was in high school, he was found by a girl in the class of H-pong.

114
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,220
He was beaten and put on the back of a washi.

115
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
He couldn't be invited to the Hina Festival after all.

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,520
If he gambles, he always loses a lot.

117
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,380
He runs away from the debt collector and loses his salary.

118
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,060
He is attacked by a crow and falls.

119
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,280
He runs away from food and is caught by a dog.

120
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,420
He is caught in catch sales.

121
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,780
My birthday is cursed.

122
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,180
He can't be with me anymore.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,500
It's all a mess.

124
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,440
I hate March 3rd.

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,720
You don't have to worry about it.

126
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,540
He hasn't been with me until now.

127
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm going to a Hina Festival party today.

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
I want to go.

129
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,940
I'll invite you.

130
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
What? A party?

131
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,180
I'm going.

132
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,860
I'm going.

133
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,980
He said he only likes Kei.

134
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,480
I feel sorry for him.

135
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,080
Will you have a feast?

136
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,540
Of course.

137
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,940
I'm going to eat sushi that he likes.

138
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,860
Great.

139
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
I can eat sushi for the first time in a long time.

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,620
Yes, this is Hachijo in Koenmai.

141
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,580
Yes, sir.

142
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,320
Chief, an accident happened at the 4th store.

143
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,720
What?

144
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,360
At the house of a rich man in Koenmai.

145
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,740
Let's go.

146
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,720
Me?

147
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,140
Don't be nervous.

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040
Let me go, chief.

149
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,920
I was invited to the party for a girl.

150
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,540
I want to eat sushi.

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,480
He is really not with Ryo.

152
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,820
Listen.

153
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,080
The police's duty is to prevent any crime by considering the safety of the people.

154
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,820
Do you understand?

155
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,200
Come here.

156
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,960
The house of a rich man in Koenmai is here.

157
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,700
I can't believe I can eat sushi.

158
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,760
I don't have it.

159
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,100
I bought it.

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,280
Thank you.

161
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,480
Do you have the grape?

162
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,560
Yes.

163
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,040
What?

164
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,600
There is a girl's dormitory behind it.

165
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,780
The moon hasn't yet fallen.

166
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,500
Ryo, hurry up.

167
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Yes, I'm back.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,880
The night of the night.

169
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,280
The night of the night.

170
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,620
The night of the night.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,740
The night of the night.

172
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,780
The night of the night.

173
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,120
The night of the night.

174
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,020
The night of the night.

175
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,660
The night of the night.

176
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,520
The night of the night.

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,300
The night of the night.

178
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
The night of the night.

179
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,560
The night of the night.

180
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,260
The night of the night.

181
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,480
The night of the night.

182
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,900
The night of the night.

183
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,100
The night of the night.

184
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,280
The night of the night.

185
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,200
The night of the night.

186
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,180
Ryo, let's go.

187
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,080
You want to eat sushi.

188
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,260
I want sushi.

189
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,400
Is photography a good job?

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,100
Yeah.

191
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,200
N-No, I didn't mean that.

192
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm so worried about you now,

193
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't sleep at night.

194
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,900
O-Of course.

195
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,340
The police are responsible for preventing any crime.

196
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,700
Yes.

197
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,700
But stealing a doll is a stupid crime.

198
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,380
It's a prank.

199
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,120
Ryo!

200
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
If you're talking about my doll,

201
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,520
then you're not the one who's there.

202
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,160
Huh?

203
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
I have 500 million yen!

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm sorry!

205
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
500 million yen!

206
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,740
Ha-ha!

207
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,120
That one is 200 million yen,

208
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,800
and this one is 300 million yen.

209
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,740
It's a cheap one.

210
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,440
200 million and 300 million?

211
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
Hey, don't touch it!

212
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,160
I just want to see it.

213
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,440
Hmph!

214
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,020
So, what about the doll?

215
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,520
I asked the girl for it three years ago,

216
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,780
and it's finally finished.

217
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,280
This is all I have.

218
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,040
Let me tell you what I think about it.

219
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,760
The girl's got a lot better with the doll.

220
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,560
Oh, really?

221
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,480
But now I like you better.

I have to count to see

249
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,180
Huh!

250
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,620
Where are you going?

251
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,800
You idiot! Even if you break this line, you won't get your salary!

252
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,120
I know, I know!

253
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,380
Haha, don't worry. I'll be very careful.

254
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm counting on you.

255
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,260
I'm thirsty.

256
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,440
Hey, get me some tea!

257
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,780
It's the usual gyoza with gold leaf!

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,560
Gyoza with gold leaf?

259
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,060
Thank you!

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,300
What are you talking about? I'll drink it.

261
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,460
I don't want to waste your tea!

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,240
I paid the tax, so I can keep it for free.

263
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm counting on you.

264
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,460
Oh, how stingy.

265
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,980
The party is about to begin.

266
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom.

267
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,640
Hey, the toilet paper is up to 10cm!

268
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,080
I can't run anymore! The corridor is going to be damaged!

269
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,960
The female staff is right there.

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,100
They'll come back before the chief notices.

271
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,880
But is this really a bathroom?

272
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,120
What?

273
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,240
Did you call that turtle's primitive man?

274
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
He's the worst! He's the best!

275
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,080
It's okay. It's Ryo's birthday today.

277
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,580
You have to be patient.

278
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,340
But he's a security guard. I don't know if he'll come.

279
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,160
I don't know about that.

280
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,380
He'll come out like a cockroach.

281
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,820
Yeah, he'll turn around and be right behind us.

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,340
A cockroach? That's bad!

283
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,900
He looks like a

284
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,060
What?

285
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,860
If you're going to complain, go home!

286
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,040
Yeah, yeah!

287
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,900
Don't make a fuss!

288
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,980
Let's start the party!

289
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,100
Ryo, are you okay with being a security guard?

290
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah, I'm fine.

291
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,840
What's with this taste?

292
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,920
Are you guys cooking properly?

293
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,360
Stop laughing.

294
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,720
What do you mean?

295
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,820
Yum-Yum!

296
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,820
I'm proud to be a security guard.

297
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,680
Well, I'm the security guard's assistant.

298
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,540
No!

299
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,140
What?

300
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm very nosy.

301
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,500
I'll have to run away.

302
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,140
Ryo!

303
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,000
Thanks, Chanyu!

304
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,240
No, thank you.

305
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,740
I'll have a drink to calm him down.

306
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,840
I don't want that.

307
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,040
Ugh!

308
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,700
Please, give me 30 more.

309
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,460
Yes.

310
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,240
Oh, I don't mind.

311
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,220
Thank you.

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,160
Hey, Reiko!

313
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,360
Do you still want sushi?

314
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,240
Wait a minute.

315
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,820
I ordered a lot.

316
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,580
You're still eating so much?

317
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,740
The stomach that goes in sushi is different.

318
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,740
It's different.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
What's different?

320
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,180
Your stomach is a dust chute.

321
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,060
It's terrible.

322
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,140
I hope you don't mind.

323
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,980
If I don't find the chief,

324
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,580
March 3rd this year will be a good day.

325
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,340
Yes, it's me, Ryotsu.

326
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,460
Oh, it's not me.

327
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,880
Yes, it's Ohara.

328
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,320
Chief Ohara.

329
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,480
Yes, yes.

330
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,180
Don't worry, chief.

331
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,380
I'm checking it hard right now.

332
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,040
What?

333
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,900
There's nothing wrong.

334
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,180
Oh, Ryotsu is worried.

335
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,240
No, I'll tell him.

336
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,460
He's a useful man at times like this.

337
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,160
Yes?

338
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,840
Yes, it's Ryotsu.

339
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,040
Ohara, are you still in the bathroom?

340
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,880
Yes, but there's still something that's not coming out.

341
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,060
What are you doing, Ryotsu Kankichi?

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,400
What?

343
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,380
Is someone there?

344
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,880
No, it's nothing.

345
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
If you're working, go back quickly.

346
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,280
Who is it, Ryotsu?

347
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,860
Shut up!

348
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,720
What?

349
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,940
Wait a minute.

350
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,760
I'm going now.

351
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,660
No, no, no.

352
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,200
You don't have to come.

353
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,820
What are you going to do, senpai?

354
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,200
I'll be right back.

355
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,900
Leave the sushi.

356
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,900
What's he doing?

357
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,500
Ouch!

358
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,540
I'm too hungry to eat.

359
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,500
Oh, my God.

360
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,540
Ryotsu, are you there?

361
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,560
Ryotsu!

362
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,660
Ryotsu!

363
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,880
What are you doing?

364
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,580
Oh, no.

365
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,400
Ryotsu!

366
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,400
Ryotsu!

367
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,260
Hey, Ryotsu!

368
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,720
Come out!

369
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,360
Hello, hello.

370
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,040
It's been a week.

371
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,020
You've been out for a week, but you're still out.

372
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,260
No, I mean...

373
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm going to the Hina Doll's security.

374
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,080
Thank you.

375
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,380
Thank you.

376
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,380
Oh, this is the bathroom.

377
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,680
That was close.

378
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,660
That eye is completely suspicious.

379
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,980
A Hina Doll worth 500 million yen.

380
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Takada spent so much money on a Hina Doll.

381
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,140
Even the Hina Doll he carved with his hair

382
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,120
is still not out.

383
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,340
I mean, my heart is filled with his heart.

384
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,240
That's all it is.

385
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,280
First of all,

386
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,900
if I had a Hina Doll like this,

387
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,680
it would be a disaster

388
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,000
just to lose one of them.

389
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,240
What?

390
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,360
N-No!

391
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,580
No, no, no!

392
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,360
No, no, no!

393
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,340
No, no, no!

394
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,720
Ouch!

395
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Ouch!

396
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,240
That's awful!

397
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,000
I have 500 million yen in all.

398
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,240
Even if I lose one of them,

399
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,160
even if I lose one of them…

400
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,380
Even if I lose one of them,

401
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,700
even if I lose one of them,

402
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,980
20 million yen.

403
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,740
It's not able to be paid well.

404
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,100
Did I get beaten up

405
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,380
when I went to the female security?

406
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,520
What?

407
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,260
That's right.

408
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,280
The female security guy.

409
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,440
Alright.

410
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:35,820
Ah!

411
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,820
What's the matter, Ryo?

412
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,000
S...san!

413
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,760
I...I'm in the washroom!

414
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You again?

415
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,620
You're so upset.

416
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,400
Is she really coming back to us?

417
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,780
The sushi was here so we didn't have to kid ourselves about it.

418
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,460
And so, our food is ready to be served.

419
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,140
You're right.

420
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,340
Ugh, she's so annoying!

421
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,620
It looks so good!

422
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,160
Huh? What...what is this?!

423
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,820
It's like juice.

424
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,020
It's like an ama.

425
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,220
Is it okay?

426
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,360
Sushi!

427
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,760
You go first.

428
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll go first.

429
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,900
My hair!

430
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,820
Who's there? Ryo?

431
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,820
I'll be fine if I don't get it.

432
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm a beggar, so I won't let you touch it.

433
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,260
Ryo!

434
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,780
What are you doing?

435
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,280
Yes!

436
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm worried about you.

437
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,980
I'll take care of this.

438
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,340
But...

439
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,680
It's about you.

440
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,120
You might be able to turn a scarecrow into a fake one.

441
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,980
That's ridiculous!

442
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,240
Besides, a scarecrow is scared of your face.

443
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,920
That's ridiculous!

444
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,120
Go!

445
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,480
Okay.

446
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,980
I hope you don't get it.

447
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,920
You really are a genius, but you're not good at making things.

448
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,980
Please don't let me get it.

449
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,840
You really have good eyes.

450
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,180
Especially this eye-catching face.

451
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,080
You don't look at me that much.

452
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,280
What?

453
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,880
What the heck is this?

454
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,300
DEFENDER

455
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,220
What happened?

456
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,780
Damn, I've been found out!

457
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,180
I've done something crazy.

458
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,320
I think you did it on your own.

459
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,100
At this point...

460
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,420
Leader!

461
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,740
What are you doing here?

462
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,900
What?

463
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,880
No way!

464
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,840
Boss, the person you're talking about is a horrible person!

465
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,020
I just touched it a little, but I'm sorry.

466
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,380
500 million yen!

467
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,880
That one eye is worth 50 million yen!

468
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
No, no matter what, you're the main actress of the escape doll!

469
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,920
I won't give you 100 million yen!

470
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,760
How much did you pay?

471
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,320
500 million yen!

472
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,760
M-Mebina...

473
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,240
No way!

474
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
Boss, what are you talking about?

475
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Kingaichi.

476
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,800
I will pay you back for this.

477
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,640
I'll pay you back for the rest of my life.

478
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,640
Even if you work 24 hours a day, you'll die.

479
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,680
My wife and daughter work, too.

480
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,940
Oh, what a poor boss.

481
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,880
One mistake and the Ohara family is destroyed.

482
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,040
I understand.

483
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,180
A policeman who must protect the people's property

484
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,300
He did such a bad thing,

485
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,140
That's unforgivable.

486
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,940
Ohara take responsibility.

487
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,760
As of today, I quit my job as a policeman.

488
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,980
I will pay you back with retirement money.

489
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,980
What?

490
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,760
No, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

491
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,640
Even if you do something like that,

492
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,940
Don't stop, Ryotsu!

493
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,180
That kind of retirement money is not enough.

494
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,800
Eh, no, wait a minute...

495
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,380
Then I will pay even if you sell the house.

496
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,920
Uncle, will you lose your house?

497
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,340
There is no choice.

498
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,800
Miss, I was wrong.

499
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,880
If you make a mistake, it is natural to apologize and atone for it honestly.

500
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
The worst thing is to escape without taking responsibility.

501
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,280
Miss, actually I...

502
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,020
Ryotsu, don't bother everyone.

503
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,800
Then, I will go to the headquarters to make a confession.

504
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm sorry.

505
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,180
I'm sorry.

506
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,920
What's going on?

507
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,320
We were playing in this room...

508
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,980
Over here.

509
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,940
Wait.

510
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,340
I broke the Hina doll.

511
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,440
I thought you would get angry, so I wrote a confession letter and tried to make it look like the thief stole it.

512
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,580
What did you say?

513
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,940
I'm sorry.

514
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,460
I broke the Hina doll that you cherished so much.

515
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm sorry.

516
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,320
Papa, what did you say?

517
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm sorry.

518
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,940
I didn't know what was going to happen.

519
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,360
For all those years,

520
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,080
Who made this Hina doll?

521
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,500
It was made for Amarine, isn't that right?

522
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,620
Papa?

523
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,040
Just for nothing,

524
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,020
the best thing is that I am taking care of you girls.

525
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,460
Papa...

526
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,060
Papa...

527
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm sorry!

528
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,140
I'm sorry, Papa!

529
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,760
Oh, good, good.

530
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,400
But you don't have to apologize.

531
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,980
As you said, it's best to apologize honestly.

532
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,680
Right?

533
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,440
Yes.

534
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,400
Well, that's a good thing, Chief.

535
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,880
But, then, this Hina doll is...

536
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,320
Disgusting.

537
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,720
Could it be...

538
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,660
She's...

539
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,200
No, that's not it.

540
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,100
I'm sorry for the female material.

541
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,700
You know I broke the fake doll?

542
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,200
No, that's...

543
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,680
Mama!

544
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,060
I'm sorry.

545
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
I did it.

546
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,460
If you apologize honestly...

547
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,440
That's my child's story.

548
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,420
I'm going to work with you for the rest of your life and make you pay for it!

549
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,540
Please.

550
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,560
I'm begging you.

551
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,160
Hina Ryozu!

552
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,600
No, Chief.

553
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,000
I knew it.

554
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,900
March 3rd is not a good day!

555
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,460
Damn it!

556
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,280
I hate Hina Festival!

557
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,360
On the third day of the year,

558
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
there is a castle that stands undisguised,

559
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,320
and it is called Amoroshijou.

560
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,140
On this castle, there is a damsel

561
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,860
who has a golden scale.

562
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,000
All right!

563
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
I got that golden damsel!

564
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,640
Next time on Ninja vs Indy Ryozu

565
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,320
It's a pleasure!

566
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,640
To be continued

567
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,860
End of Part 2

568
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,500
To be continued

569
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,380
To be continued

570
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,040
To be continued

571
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,860
To be continued

572
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,760
Because time will pass

573
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Don't stare at me

574
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,180
Let's laugh and live

575
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:57,320
Even if it rains today

576
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,840
Tomorrow will be sunny

577
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,260
Bye bye

578
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,680
Let's wash our hands

579
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,780
Goodbye to the unpleasant things

580
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,260
Oh yeah

581
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's live as we like

582
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,480
There is something good

583
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,320
Outside the door

584
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,300
Let's go

585
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,660
The sun is calling
