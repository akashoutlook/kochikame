00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,240
Ah~ The summer has come again this year!

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,160
It has come, it has come!

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,440
Ah~ The summer has come again this year!

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,120
It has come, it has come!

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,640
It has come!

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,620
I'm going to the south wind

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,260
I'm going to the south wind

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,040
I'm going to the south wind

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm going to the south wind

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm going to the south wind

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:35,940
I'm going to the south wind

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm going to the south wind

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,080
I'm going to the south wind

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm going to the south wind

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm going to the south wind

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,460
I'm going to the south wind

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm going to the south wind

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm going to the south wind

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm going to the south wind

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,860
I'm going to the south wind

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,740
I'm going to the south wind

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,780
I'm going to the south wind

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to the south wind

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,380
I'm going to the south wind

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,740
I'm going to the south wind

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,300
I'm going to the south wind

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,860
I'm going to the south wind

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,620
I'm going to the south wind

30
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm going to the south wind

31
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,520
Otsu!

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,580
I'll skiski with shaved ice!

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,420
I haven't done this in a long time!

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,800
Shaved ice, give me some strawberries.

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,040
Here you are.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,860
Huh? Since when did you start making shaved ice?

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,620
Since this year.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Shaved ice is easier, and you don't get angry.

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,860
That's true.

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,820
I was thinking of throwing that away.

42
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,980
Throwing it away? That's a waste.

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,820
You can still use this shaved ice.

44
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,280
Well,

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,780
it's the flow of time.

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
Here you are.

47
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,680
If you don't need it, I'll take it.

48
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,260
Oh, no problem.

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,180
Grandma!

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,340
Hm?

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Give me some shaved ice.

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,840
I want some melon.

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,020
Here you are.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,720
You guys,

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,620
if you don't study and wait for your vacation,

56
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,640
your mom will scold you.

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,340
Ryo, are you sure you're going to sell oil in a place like this?

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,380
I'm not selling oil!

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm eating shaved ice.

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,060
Does that mean this is my last night at home?

61
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,440
you can hardly talk inside like this.

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,000
He ate.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
If you eat something cold,

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,080
you're gonna get diarrhea and sleep.

65
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,640
If you have diarrhea, you're gonna get stage 2.

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,680
See you later.

67
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,580
Yeah!

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,660
Go on, take that!

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm just a worker who's wandering in a hell of a world.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,380
Ryo-chan, what's that?

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,100
It's an ancient ice-shrink. I got it from a candy store.

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
An ice-shrink?

73
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,480
You can get anything you want, right, senpai?

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,660
What are you going to do, Ruki?

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,280
You know I'm going to make shaved ice, right?

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,880
In the winter, I'll make a kotatsu with a mikan.

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
In the summer, I'll make shaved ice with a salt bar.

78
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,280
I can even make katsubushi with this.

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,600
I can't help it.

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
Senpai, what about ice-shrink?

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,540
Ryo-chan bought it from the supermarket last week.

82
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,920
There's this pen-kichi.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,440
No!

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,580
You can't use a toy like that!

85
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,860
In this era of gourmet, shaved ice has to be real.

86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,480
I wonder if shaved ice is also real.

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,060
It depends on the time and place.

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,760
I've been showing off this shaved ice machine until last week.

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,680
I'll make it right away.

90
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,700
But Ryo-chan, if you say it's real, you can't use ice from the fridge, right?

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,640
Huh?

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,880
If you say it's real, you have to use ice from Mont Blanc or the South Pole.

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,820
The South Pole ice?

94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,220
There's a branch of Nakagawa Continent in Greenland, so I can use the North Pole ice.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,560
That's it!

96
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,540
The gourmet shaved ice is from the North Pole, not the South Pole!

97
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,400
I bought that ice. Please share it with me right away.

98
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,760
Oh, okay.

99
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,360
I'll be right there.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,260
I hate waiting.

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,440
Okay.

102
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,160
Then, I'll take a break.

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,820
He's getting serious.

104
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,060
What?

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,600
It's noisy and I can't sleep.

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,820
Senpai, the ice from the North Pole has arrived!

107
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,060
Huh?

108
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,020
Hurry up! The ice has arrived!

109
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,440
It's here!

110
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,180
Where is the ice?

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,840
One whole dumpling?

112
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,040
Yay!

113
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,500
This is all mine!

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,780
Here, take the ice. It's 10,000 yen.

115
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,900
This way! A little further!

116
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,820
Ow, ow!

117
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,740
Ah!

118
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,600
Ow, ow!

119
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,340
You're too noisy!

120
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,200
Ow, ow, ow!

121
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,800
What happened?

122
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,740
Ow, ow, ow!

123
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,260
Come on, you're too noisy!

124
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,420
Ow, ow, ow!

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,140
This is bad.

126
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,840
No, no, no.

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,460
Ow, ow, ow!

128
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,980
Ow, ow, ow!

129
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,260
Hey!

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,960
Ow, ow, ow!

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,040
Ow!

132
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,660
What's that?

133
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,240
An altar?!

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,280
An abomination?!

135
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,820
Ah, it's Ryo.

136
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,740
A museum!

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,160
It's shining different after all!

138
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,300
Come on, Ryo.

139
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,660
Can you give me some too?

140
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,780
No!

141
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Why not?

142
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,940
Just a little!

143
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,220
I'm just kidding.

144
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,620
I bought this precious ice from Mizeni.

145
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,740
I'm not going to do it for free.

146
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,800
You're so stubborn.

147
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,260
No matter what you say, I already paid 10,000 yen.

148
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,440
The ice is all mine.

149
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,540
The ice from the fridge suits you guys.

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,780
What a precious sound.

151
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,560
Compared to that, oh, what a wonderful sound.

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,600
It's like the sound of a hornet's cry.

153
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,820
This is the traditional Japanese ice.

154
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,380
I'll pour the syrup on it.

155
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,880
It's done.

156
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,160
The ice is as delicate and beautiful as the blue snow.

157
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,020
First, I'll take a bite.

158
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
It's delicious!

159
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,000
I knew the real thing was different.

160
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
And in return,

161
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,660
the smell of the water and the fridge is mixed together.

162
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,420
This smell.

163
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,860
It's really pleasant.

164
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,540
This is delicious.

165
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,320
It's full of the old-fashioned romance.

166
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,240
It's a bold and beautiful ice.

167
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,340
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been born.

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
This is the world's most expensive ice.

169
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,580
No, rather, this is the only one that should be called ice.

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,420
The ice that I made for free in the fridge is no longer ice.

171
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,300
Until yesterday,

172
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,780
I ate the best ice that I made with this pen-kichi-kun.

173
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,660
That's right.

174
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,340
This time, let's make it luxurious with milk.

175
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,660
What?

176
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,840
Take this!

177
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,140
Don't steal the ice on your own.

178
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,760
I'll arrest you.

179
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,520
Isn't it a little good?

180
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,000
Thanks to this ice,

181
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,900
I can organize the traffic.

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,980
Look, the car is moving.

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,780
Hurry up and get to work.

184
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,940
Oh, Kei-chan.

185
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,900
I think this is it.

186
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,380
It's SO good!

187
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,000
It melts in your mouth.

188
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,060
Episode 4

189
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,120
It's so good.

190
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,180
utilities

191
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,500
LUXURY

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,420
It's the perfect texture,

193
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,620
but be careful.

194
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,300
Hmm, it's beautiful.

195
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,860
Oh, that's real delicious!

196
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,220
The shining of the rose and the softness of the tangerine.

197
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:13,220
The sound of the ice popping is the elegance of Venus's whisper that woke her from her sleep of millions of years.

198
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,680
Fantastic! This painting is a rose-colored shadow.

199
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm going to eat it all up!

200
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,820
I'm going to eat it all up!

201
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
The city is so cold that I'm getting dizzy.

202
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,540
But it's a bit hot when it's the 70th drink.

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,180
You're getting tired, aren't you?

204
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,700
That's not true.

205
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,740
Is this the ice?

206
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,580
It's cold.

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,640
It's dangerous, so get away from here.

208
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,520
It feels good.

209
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,140
It's dangerous, so get away from here.

210
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,240
Damn it!

211
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
Hey! That's my ice!

212
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,640
Don't stick to it!

213
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,480
I paid for it and bought it!

214
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,240
It's my food for a week!

215
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,260
Delicious!

216
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,380
The strawberry flavor and the milk topping are perfect!

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,840
I ate it all up and my head is getting numb!

218
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,700
Are you okay, senpai?

219
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,100
Don't push yourself too hard.

220
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,660
I gave it to the neighbors.

221
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,980
What kind of rule is this?

222
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,580
If you think this is just water, you can put in as much as you want!

223
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,940
Two-thirds of a human body is water.

224
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,060
There's still a little bit of luck left.

225
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,260
Okay, I'll give you a special service.

226
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,400
I'll give you this authentic ice cream.

227
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm already done eating.

228
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,660
That's right.

229
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,500
I don't need it.

230
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
You take responsibility for it.

231
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,140
Okay.

232
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,720
I'll eat it all up!

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,480
I'll eat it with all my might.

234
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,540
What are you going to do, Tsunori?

235
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,300
It's obvious, right?

236
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm going to eat it.

237
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,980
I'm going to get sick of it because it only tastes like strawberry and milk.

238
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm going to get sick of it because it only tastes like strawberry and milk.

239
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,140
I need to change the sauce with ketchup while I have my coke.

240
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,120
I need to change the sauce with ketchup while I have my coke.

241
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,880
On this side, I'll mix natto with eggs.

242
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,620
I will also add a vitamin drink to the à purée .

243
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,420
What do you think?

244
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
It looks delicious, right?

245
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,380
Will you really eat it?

246
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,820
Of course I will!

247
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,620
It's hot.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm going to go through a period of slowing down.

249
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,140
I just want to be able to eat a little more.

250
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,980
I'm going to stop eating the ice cream.

251
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,600
It's getting cold.

252
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,340
I'll drink some tea and warm up.

253
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,080
Alright, it's warmed up.

254
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,960
I can't take it anymore. I can't eat anymore.

255
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,720
What are you going to do, Nakoriya?

256
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm going to make rice balls and eat them later.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,040
What's this?

258
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,380
Ryotsu, is it your doing again?

259
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,700
What? I didn't do anything.

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,960
Idiot! Come here!

261
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,980
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

262
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,960
My ears are getting numb!

263
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,000
What's this ice?

264
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,080
Your phone is still ringing.

265
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,020
This is...

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
a stage equipment prepared for the chief.

267
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,280
For me?

268
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,740
Yes.

269
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,980
This ice is...

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
a special gift for you.

271
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm going to sing a karaoke song for you.

272
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,840
Don't try to fool me!

273
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,380
This is the ice from the northern region...

274
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,860
imported from Greenland.

275
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,500
Ryo-chan bought it from Kei-chan for 10,000 yen.

276
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,960
Ryotsu!

277
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,400
Would you like some, chief?

278
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,900
No!

279
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,640
Get rid of this ice!

280
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,260
I'm going to kill you!

281
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,320
K-kill?

282
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,280
Shut up!

283
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,380
If this ice is still fresh and clean by tomorrow,

284
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,440
you'll have moved to the North Pole Expo!

285
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,500
T-the North Pole Expo?

286
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,620
We have that kind of thing?

287
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,380
We're doing this for you.

288
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,940
Got it, Ryotsu?

289
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
The North Pole Expo

290
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,360
The North Pole Expo

291
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,080
The North Pole Expo

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,260
The North Pole Expo

293
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, I can't eat all of this today.

294
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,140
Oh, this is it.

295
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,560
The ice cream Ryo bought.

296
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,220
It's a real North Pole ice cream.

297
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,140
If it's so noticeable, it's easy to be rumored.

298
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,420
What are you going to do?

299
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,720
I was going to make it into shaved ice and eat it.

300
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Shaved ice?

301
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,660
If you make this much ice into shaved ice, you can do ski.

302
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,420
That's it.

303
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,160
This hot summer ski.

304
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,880
I'm going to take it.

305
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,300
You can think of it as rental skiing and rental snowboarding.

306
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,200
You can think of it as rental skiing and rental snowboarding.

307
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,160
The money will be earned and the ice will be cleaned up.

308
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,380
It's a real miracle.

309
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,040
Let's get started.

310
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,080
I'm going to do it.

311
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm going to do it.

312
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm going to do it.

313
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,320
What is this?

314
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,060
Even if this hand is mine...

315
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,980
What are you going to do next?

316
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,420
I'm sure it's going to be about money.

317
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,680
What are you going to do next?

318
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,820
The origin of Ryo's power is just a profit.

319
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:32,640
The origin of Ryo's power is just a profit.

320
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,480
Good job, take it to the rest.

321
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,280
Good job, take it to the rest.

322
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,720
Ryo-san, leave it to me.

323
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,240
Next is the seat.

324
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,160
OK!

325
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,060
This is the Asana Island!

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,420
Now we know the route.

327
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,100
Kankichi, what are you doing with that ice?

328
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,180
We've done a lot.

329
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,380
Ryo, I brought a ski and snowboard.

330
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,800
Yeah, come with me!

331
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,480
OK!

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
OK, now we're ready.

333
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,580
You did a good job.

334
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,680
Welcome to Ryotsu Snowland.

335
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,660
The business starts now.

336
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,400
What is Ryotsu Snowland?

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Come and take a look.

338
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,460
Snow falls in the summer of Katsushika.

339
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,580
The city's oasis is like a desert.

340
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,120
Karuizawa is a lowland town.

341
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,200
You can ski and snowboard in the middle of the summer.

342
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,320
You can even play bobsleigh.

343
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,260
Come on, let's go!

344
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,680
Let's go in.

345
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,540
Yeah, it's going to be fun!

346
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,680
Me too!

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,480
Me too!

348
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,960
The traffic jam has been resolved, but there's still a long way to go.

349
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,940
Here's the rental.

350
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,800
The delivery is not allowed.

351
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,660
The group is 10% off.

352
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,960
The kid, the girl, the old man and the grandma are 30% off.

353
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,540
How's that?

354
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,220
That snowboard.

355
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,200
Yes, yes.

356
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,440
Welcome!

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes!

358
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,280
Here you are.

359
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,760
Thank you.

360
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,580
I think this will cost a few million yen.

361
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,440
That's right.

362
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Let's get out of the store.

363
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,160
Come on, come on.

364
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,020
Snowland's signature ice sushi.

365
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,240
Father and mother cry and rejoice.

366
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,060
Squid in a snowboard.

367
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,820
Kids' favorite, egg fried.

368
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,180
If you don't eat this, there's no point in coming here.

369
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,040
Then take one, snowboard.

370
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,280
I want an egg.

371
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,560
Here you are, snowboard.

372
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,280
One egg.

373
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,600
We'll eat the eggs.

374
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,660
Wow.

375
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,000
Curse.

376
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,740
It's great.

377
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
The rice is frozen in時候 ice.

378
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,440
That's right.

379
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,080
The sticky rice should be chilled and it will last a long time.

380
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
How do you eat it?

381
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,540
Just like this.

382
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,640
You have to put jam on it and eat it.

383
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,500
It's delicious.

384
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,840
This is jam made of salt.

385
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,100
If you don't like a raw pizza,

386
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,560
how about some frozen curry that surprises even Indians?

387
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,720
Come on, everyone.

388
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,780
Even curry is ice.

389
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,620
I want that.

390
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,560
Curry!

391
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,460
I can still go as far as I want.

392
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,060
I'll give you the food you dropped.

393
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,520
If you hit me, I'll throw a car and a ball at you.

394
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm a smart pitcher who likes to throw.

395
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160
Give it to me.

396
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,320
Me too.

397
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,260
Me too.

398
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,380
Don't push me.

399
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,400
The ball is 200 yen.

400
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,440
Me too.

401
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,460
I'm already sold out.

402
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
I can't keep up with this business.

403
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,700
What?

404
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,080
What did you say?

405
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,900
The amount?

406
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,160
He made his own snow land in the park.

407
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,940
He's collecting customers.

408
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,120
He rents skis and snowboards and makes money.

409
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,200
What?

410
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,480
He's a genius.

411
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,080
I know.

412
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,780
If they're making money,

413
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,400
I'll buy another snow land.

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,520
What is it, Chief?

415
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,940
You're making money by making these things in the park?

416
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
It's nothing.

417
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,180
I'm not just going to clean up the ice.

418
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,280
I'm going to make a place where I can meet the residents of this area.

419
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,820
I wanted to make a place for us to hang out and make people happy.

420
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,220
That's all I wanted to do.

421
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,700
Then what is this?

422
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,620
What?

423
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,680
Ryozu! I know you have money behind you.

424
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,160
Give it back to everyone!

425
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,400
No! I don't want to!

426
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,860
Wait!

427
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,640
Time out!

428
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,620
Time out!

429
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,360
Wait!

430
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,000
That was close!

431
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,460
Ryozu!

432
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,260
I'll take it! I have an egg!

433
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,920
Wasabi!

434
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,960
Wait!

435
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,000
Wait!

436
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,980
Wait!

437
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,880
Damn it!

438
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,420
No!

439
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,400
Ah! It's DC!

440
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,460
Stop!

441
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,800
Ouch!

442
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,980
Watch out!

443
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,080
Ouch!

444
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,040
I'll give the camera to anyone!

445
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,460
You!

446
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,720
Prepare yourself, Ryozu!

447
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,200
What? You're not going to do that?

448
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,200
You're naive!

449
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,380
Ouch!

450
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,220
Ouch!

451
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,160
Ouch!

452
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,560
You're naive!

453
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,900
Ah...

454
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,760
Ah...

455
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,400
Aaah!

456
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,460
It's falling!

457
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,360
Ouch!

458
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:03,860
силь은 피가

459
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:03,900
아

460
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:03,940
아

461
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,840
Aaaaaaah!

462
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,720
Aaaaaah!

463
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,620
Aaaaaah!

464
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,140
Aaaaaah!

465
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,840
Aaaaaah!

466
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,320
Otsu!

467
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,260
Aaaah!

468
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
What's that?

469
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,920
Huh? Where did everybody go?

470
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,400
It's time for the next round.

471
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,780
Ah, Ryousha!

472
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:38,960
Aaaah!

473
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,780
Aaaah!

474
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,100
It's strange. Nobody's here.

475
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,720
Aaaah!

476
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,140
S-Sire!

477
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
Help me!

478
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,540
Help me!

479
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:14,960
Help me!

480
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,240
Aaaah!

481
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,440
I protected you.

482
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,820
I'm returning this money to everyone.

483
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,020
No! It's mine!

484
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,780
A-Action!

485
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,740
Thank goodness. I could use all the ice.

486
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,660
He's a smart guy who can use all the money he's made.

487
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,680
I wonder if it's his instinct to do so.

488
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,180
Shut up!

489
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,060
Oh no! I'm in trouble!

490
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,800
I'm in trouble!

491
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,480
I'll get in trouble if I make Reiko angry!

492
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:08,840
Stop it!

493
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,640
The high-speed road will be thrown away!

494
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,720
The mini-patto will be sucked away!

495
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,140
The highway will be reversed!

496
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,400
That way, I won't get my wife back!

497
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,420
Next time, Reiko's Raging Inferno!

498
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,380
See you then!

499
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,560
Let's smile at any time

500
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,760
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

501
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,240
Even if anything happens

502
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,260
Smile cutely, okay?

503
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,680
It's okay to go out with a face that's nothing

504
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,120
Hey, smile at me

505
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,140
You're not bad

506
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,840
Hey, smile at me

507
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,180
With the same attitude as before, yeah!

508
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,980
When?

509
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,480
But, smile, okay?

510
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,240
It's not beautiful when women are serious

511
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,020
You should smile right away

512
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,340
If you're not a kid
