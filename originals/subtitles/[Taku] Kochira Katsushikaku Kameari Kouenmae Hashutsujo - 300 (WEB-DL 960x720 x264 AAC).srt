What a splendid Nishikigori!

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,020
You know what?

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,380
I like the part where there's a little pearl in the water.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,860
Yeah, it's very beautiful.

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,760
These three colors are also very colorful.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,520
Which one?

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,120
Hey, stop it! The water is dirty!

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,160
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,380
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!

34
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,380
It's all right now.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,060
We've eliminated the bacteria.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,620
That's it for the pet boom.

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Excuse me.

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,440
You've become so obsessed with Nishikigori,

39
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,000
it's like a kid, don't you think?

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,300
I can't help it.

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,740
Since he was a child,

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,120
I've raised him with all my heart and soul.

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,660
Really?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,520
I thought everyone thought Nishikigori was the same.

45
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,720
But this way of looking at it,

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,640
it's become a different kind of pattern.

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,020
Right?

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,140
One bite of Nishikigori,

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,620
Even if you say Nishikigoi, there are both Japanese and German words.

50
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,080
German words?

51
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,080
Japan has improved the way they speak, and has made their Nishikigoi beautiful.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,000
But in Asia, America, and Europe, there are Nishikigoi-like people.

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,960
I called everyone here today to see this Nishikigoi.

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,960
Why did you have to do that?

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,440
What do you mean?

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,340
A clumsy person like you wouldn't know, but look!

57
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,980
That guy has a 53 cm long body, and he's planning to appear in the Himpyoukai next time.

58
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,640
Himpyoukai? The Nishikigoi?

59
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,880
Yeah. He hasn't been in the competition for years.

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,020
Just by joining, he's a great honor for the Nishikigoi fans.

61
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,780
Huh?

62
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,240
The pattern changes as you grow, but this is a good place to settle down.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,160
It's a three-color male body.

64
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,500
What? Why you?

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,420
Ryo, do you know?

66
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,320
Of course I do.

67
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm the one who takes care of 88 Nishikigoi that are living in Matoi's house.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,380
You do?

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,920
You're good at raising them, aren't you?

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Well, it's important to create an environment for the Nishikigoi, such as water and land.

71
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,360
Right, President?

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Yes, that's right.

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,660
Go swim with everyone over there, Koijiro.

74
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,660
Koijiro?

75
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,480
Yeah.

76
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,520
I named them Daijirou.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,940
They're like my children.

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah.

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,100
President, this pond has a lot of trees and grass, so it's easy to accumulate garbage.

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,440
You have to drain and drain the water.

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,220
What?

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,800
The bad water flow of the pond causes diseases such as angry insects and caterpillars.

83
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm surprised.

84
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,160
I didn't know you were so familiar with the law.

85
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,700
Hypertension occurs when the temperature suddenly drops.

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,680
If you mix the salt with about 1% of the water temperature, it will recover.

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,740
I see.

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,120
I see.

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,240
I think you can win the championship with that love.

90
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,600
That's right.

91
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,320
President, you're confident, aren't you?

92
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:37,860
Well, I think I'm going to have a good time, but I'm worried that my wife and I will be on a trip for the next four days.

93
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,580
Instead of doing nothing at the marriage ceremony, what should I do in the meantime?

94
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,460
Then why don't you take over our pet management center?

95
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,080
We'll take care of the water.

96
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,460
We'll check everything from the water to the water.

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, is that so?

98
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,880
The management fee is 50,000 yen a day, which is a little expensive.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
50,000 yen?

100
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,800
Just looking at the care of love for a day?

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't change the money, so I'll leave it to you.

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:06,820
B.

103
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,100
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,460
You're shouting.

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,800
That's not true.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,100
Leave it to me.

107
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,840
I'll take care of it for 30,000 a day.

108
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,660
No, I'll take care of it for 10,000 a day.

109
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,640
You?

110
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,420
What?

111
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,960
But I'm raising two baby geese from a female bird.

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,000
What?

113
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,100
That's not true.

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,340
Of course, I'm the top breeder of two geese.

115
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm going to make money by saying something like that.

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,240
The color of my eyes has changed since I heard that 50,000 yen a day.

117
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,960
You have to have love for love.

118
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,140
Oh, that's true.

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,700
A man in love with love.

120
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,620
Me, I'm the same.

121
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,800
All right.

122
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm counting on you to buy it, Ryotsu.

123
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,900
Leave it to me.

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,500
10,000 yen a day.

125
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,220
And four horses.

126
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,160
Well then, I'll ask you to buy it, too.

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,060
I wanted to get on a ship.

128
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,460
Ah, you want to go by plane.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,960
Well, then I will fly to the sky as if I was on a boat.

130
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,780
Hahaha.

131
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,260
Butt.

132
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm not kidding. I'm counting on you.

133
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,440
See you.

134
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, thank you.

135
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,500
Have a good trip!

136
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll give you a souvenir.

137
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,040
Just by feeding you, you'll make 10,000 yen a day.

138
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Eat up!

139
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,980
Koichiro! Koikichi! Koihime!

140
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,840
Koita!

141
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm bored.

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,700
I'll try to play games to get rid of my boredom.

143
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,760
Everyone, gather around!

144
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,060
Alright! Let's see who can fly higher!

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,540
I'll do this for the best!

146
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,140
I can't believe you can tell by his voice.

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Oh, Koichiro.

148
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,540
He's different from the others and smart.

149
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll try to play a game.

150
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,380
Ready? One, two, three!

151
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,000
Alright, next up is the Waku-guri!

152
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,820
Alright!

153
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
If I put this into practice, I might be able to make some money.

154
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,240
The Waku-guri

155
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,820
The Waku-guri

156
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,680
The Waku-guri

157
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,240
The Waku-guri

158
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,080
The Waku-guri

159
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,580
The Waku-guri

160
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,260
The Waku-guri

161
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,020
The Waku-guri

162
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,680
The Waku-guri

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,040
The Waku-guri

164
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
The Waku-guri

165
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,180
The Waku-guri

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,340
The Waku-guri

167
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,800
The Waku-guri

168
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,180
The Waku-guri

169
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,680
The Waku-guri

170
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,380
The Waku-guri

171
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,760
Where will it go?

172
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,660
Where will it go?

173
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:07,840
Eh?

174
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,620
Eh?

175
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,020
Wait up...

176
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,640
Eh?

177
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,620
Te!

178
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,200
Te!

179
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,480
Te!

180
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,220
Te!

181
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,640
That's dangerous! Don't move!

182
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,840
Alright, just like that.

183
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,280
Takeya!

184
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,480
Takeya!

185
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,660
Takeya!

186
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,620
Takeya!

187
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,300
Takeya!

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,700
Are you alright?

189
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,260
Takeya!

190
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,700
Wait, that truck!

191
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,940
Wait, wait, wait!

192
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,760
I can't catch up with him because there aren't many traffic lights!

193
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,220
I can't catch up with him because there aren't many traffic lights!

194
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm going to borrow you!

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,420
Wait, Koichiro!

196
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Wait, Koichiro!

197
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,940
Wait, Koichiro!

198
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,200
Wait, Koichiro!

199
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Wait, Koichiro!

200
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:29,640
Wait, Koichiro!

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,340
Are you alright, Koichiro?

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,380
I'm so tired!

203
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,500
Koijiro! Koijiro! Come back! Koijiro!

204
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,080
Koijiro!

205
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,020
Eh? Koijiro is...

206
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,600
Shh! You're going to get rejected by Reiko.

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,540
But what are you going to do?

208
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,680
That Koi is the one you especially cherished, right?

209
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,740
The one you're going to give to the Golden Thread Embroidery?

210
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,140
That's why I'm in trouble.

211
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,000
Every 100 Koi is different.

212
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,740
I can't let you fool me.

213
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,220
Listen to me.

214
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,180
Eh?

215
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,080
The fish robot developed by Nakagawa Electro Club?

216
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,300
Shh!

217
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
This is Koijiro's photo.

218
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,680
He made a latex-like outer side...

219
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
...and put the mecha inside.

220
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,260
He made a latex-like outer side...

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,260
He made a latex-like outer side...

222
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,660
...and put the mecha inside.

223
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,500
What are you two talking about?

224
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,620
Nothing.

225
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,660
It's just a man and woman's talk.

226
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,140
Right, Nakagawa?

227
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,320
Eh?

228
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,980
Yes.

229
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,720
Let's talk more over there.

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,940
Right, Nakagawa?

231
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm glad.

232
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,200
His movements are real, and his motor is small.

233
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,040
He's the same as a real one.

234
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,980
Fish don't have expressions.

235
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,700
But tomorrow's competition...

236
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,040
He'll be eliminated in the qualifying round.

237
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,540
See ya.

238
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,620
Next time, we'll get back.

239
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,860
I'd love to!

240
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,980
Kaede!

241
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,220
Kaede!

242
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,560
While we wait, I forgot...

243
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,060
He doesn't answer my phone!

244
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,860
Come on.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,220
Stop it!

246
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,860
Stop it!

247
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,000
I've been worried about Kaede lately.

248
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,280
Is he not in good condition?

249
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,380
How old is he?

250
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,500
I don't know either.

251
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,080
Where's he?

252
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,060
I'll go search with him.

253
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,120
What?

254
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

255
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,060
If it's a group that has crossed the line, they may be discovered as fake.

256
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,880
It would be nice if they could drop the preliminary round as soon as possible.

257
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,860
Ryotsu! Nakagawa!

258
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,180
We did it! The preliminary round is passed!

259
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,660
What did you say?

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,060
Oh, what? Is it bad to have passed the preliminary round?

261
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,100
No, it's not that bad. It was good.

262
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,420
Huh? That's strange.

263
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,300
It suddenly stopped working.

264
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,260
Koijiro! What's wrong, Koijiro? Koijiro!

265
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,900
The battery is out, senpai.

266
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,760
What did you say?

267
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,660
Um, I'm sorry.

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,840
What are you going to do, Ryotsu?

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,700
Nakagawa!

270
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,520
Koijiro!

271
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,820
Leave it to me!

272
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,920
Koijiro...

273
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,320
Hey, this is going to cut the battery soon.

274
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,580
Senpai, hurry up!

275
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,200
Hey, I know. I'm going to modify it a little.

276
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,640
Oh, Koijiro... Koijiro...

277
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,600
Sorry to keep you waiting!

278
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,320
Oh, oh!

279
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,760
Koijiro is fine as it is.

280
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,020
Kiyoko!

281
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,780
Oh, Koijiro...

282
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,980
It's all good now!

283
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,560
We did it! Koijiro is left as the final candidate!

284
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,260
If we win this time, no one will be able to fool us anymore!

285
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, this is wonderful!

286
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,840
It's not only elegant and beautiful, but also makes you feel active and healthy.

287
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,460
I-is that so?

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,140
It's a little too energetic, isn't it?

289
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,500
No, it's a dynamic and dynamic feeling that has never been before.

290
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,100
It's fresh.

291
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,860
But you're too fat.

292
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,500
You may not know this, but this volume is excellent.

293
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,540
No, but...

294
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,980
Why are you so stubborn?

295
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,240
Oh, no, it's nothing.

296
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,600
Hmm?

297
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,120
Everyone, there is no dependence, right?

298
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
No, there isn't.

299
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,080
It's decided.

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
The winner is No. 52, Taisho Sanshoku.

301
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,020
What?

302
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,020
Koizuro is the winner!

303
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,260
Senpai...

304
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,640
This is an unexpected situation.

305
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,300
What is it?

306
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,640
The battery is dead.

307
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,760
There was an impossible modification.

308
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,780
Oh, I see!

309
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,920
I have a bad feeling about this.

310
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,100
Hmm...

311
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,520
The battery is dead.

312
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:47,840
What?

313
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,540
What's going on?

314
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,440
What's going on, Ryotsu?

315
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,380
Hey, wait a moment!

316
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,640
Hey, wait a moment!

317
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,820
What?

318
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,180
A robot? What happened to Koichiro?

319
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,020
He's living happily in the middle of nature.

320
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,020
Idiot!

321
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,020
Damn it! Will it end like this?

322
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,380
If this continues, it'll be a return match with Nishikigoi!

323
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,900
The commercial will continue after this!

324
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,020
What happened to Ryotsu? He's been resting.

325
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,640
He's not sick.

326
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:30,800
He's not sick.

327
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,740
I heard he started something again.

328
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,040
He must be making money.

329
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,940
Whatever. I don't know what he's doing, but if I don't see his face, I'll come back and wake him up!

330
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,080
It's cold!

331
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:00,680
Huh?

332
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,280
Why is Nishikigoi in the bath?

333
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,180
What are you doing, kid?

334
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,940
That's terrible, senpai.

335
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,740
Ryo's bath is forbidden for a while.

336
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,060
That's so unbiased!

337
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,400
What did you start?

338
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,560
Nishikigoi's pet. It's good because it sells at a high price.

339
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,520
Well, look.

340
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,620
Look at this turtle.

341
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:37,060
From this turtle, the new pattern, size, and strength of the Nishikigoi will be born.

342
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,180
Nishikigoi?

343
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,180
Hehehe.

344
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,540
Good. Good. It's going well.

345
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,420
It's fast to get bigger.

346
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,220
If you take a bath, you don't need to take a bath. You can keep a high temperature.

347
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,780
It has grown well with various products and artificial offspring.

348
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,700
But isn't this bathroom a little small?

349
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,840
I'll give you a hand.

350
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Make a bath in the bath.

351
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,420
As expected, it's fast to do.

352
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
24 hours of unmarried and unmarried,

353
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,240
I'll make you more and more various products and artificial offspring and create a perfect Nishikigoi.

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,580
Then I'm rich.

355
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,200
Ahahahaha.

356
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,700
Ahahahaha.

357
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,020
That's right.

358
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's add ocean water, hormone liquid, and an insect drink.

359
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,560
Hehehe.

360
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,140
What?

361
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,220
Ryotsu completed the love of the new species?

362
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,180
Yes.

363
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,680
It seems that it is a new species that is over 1 meter long.

364
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,800
There is a grand presentation today.

365
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,220
Oh.

366
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,900
I can't believe it.

367
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
In such a short period of time.

368
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,360
If money is involved, the power of the senior will be infinite.

369
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,020
I see.

370
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,600
I see.

371
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,320
I see.

372
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,100
I see.

373
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,140
I see.

374
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,540
I see.

375
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,080
It's amazing.

376
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,800
Everyone, we have a great guest today.

377
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,280
It was the idea of ​​human beings, and it was finally born.

378
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,120
It seems to be Odawara.

379
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:18,820
Oh, that's amazing.

380
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
It's too much.

381
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,700
It's hot.

382
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,380
It's hot.

383
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,500
What the.

384
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,540
I've never seen such a powerful three colors before.

385
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,540
No, it's different from the Taisho three colors and the Showa three colors.

386
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,820
One, two, four colors! It's not three colors!

387
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,680
That's right! This is the miracle I created in the world of the unknown.

388
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,320
It's called the Ryotsu four colors.

389
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,960
It's too narrow!

390
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,040
Senpai! It seems that orders from all over the world are running out!

391
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,380
Don't panic. I knew this would happen.

392
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,780
It's too narrow here.

393
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,880
I'll keep adding more!

394
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,320
One cup of Kouhai will produce 100,000 eggs.

395
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,020
The four colors of Ryotsu have a great reproduction power.

396
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm not saying that I'm a thief, but this Kouhai is really like a senpai.

397
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,000
I finally got the success story.

398
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,740
You did it, senpai.

399
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,280
These 300 are from Florida.

400
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,300
These 500 are from Germany.

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,160
Let's export more and more!

402
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,660
This is Europe. This is India.

403
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,740
Middle East, Russia, South America, China, Australia!

404
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:08,920
This studied as a

405
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,500
What's going on?

406
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,180
A tree has a great reproductive power.

407
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,800
Sumidagawa river has been occupied.

408
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,100
This plant is called the Ryotsu four colors.

409
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:33,800
For the sake of the

410
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,460
The four colors are growing.

411
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,720
What's going on, Senpai?

412
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,260
I have a bad feeling about this.

413
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,760
The Seine River is filled with four colors.

414
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,500
In the UK, Nessie is being chased by four colors and is running away.

415
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,780
We will show you the latest footage from the Amazon River.

416
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,560
These are the four colors chasing the Piranha.

417
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,300
What's going on?

418
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,200
The four colors are tough and have great reproduction.

419
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
They grow to 50cm in 3 days.

420
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,140
How long do they live?

421
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,020
Around 5 years.

422
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,820
No, the average lifespan of the Nishiki is 70 years.

423
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,220
70 years?

424
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,660
If they keep growing...

425
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,760
...they'll die.

426
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,820
I don't want to imagine it.

427
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,300
Koijiro...

428
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,540
Koijiro!

429
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,040
Koijiro!

430
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,140
Koijiro!

431
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,160
Koijiro!

432
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,220
Koijiro!

433
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,440
Koijiro!

434
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,960
Koijiro!

435
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,460
Koijiro!

436
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,660
Koijiro!

437
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,860
Koijiro!

438
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,120
Koijiro!

439
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,200
Koijiro!

440
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,600
Koijirou! You came back so soon!

441
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,960
Koijirou!

442
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,160
Not only in the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean,

443
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,280
but also in the South Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean,

444
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,540
a large force of four different lands was confirmed.

445
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,400
But, a voice is crossing the sea...

446
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,380
It's flying like a flying fish!

447
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,260
It's flying like a flying fish!

448
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
By the way, Tobio is also a junior.

449
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,440
According to the information from the artificial satellite,

450
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,820
these groups are moving to Japan one day.

451
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,240
Why to Japan?

452
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,380
No way...

453
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,160
No way... Senpai!

454
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
They were both defeated by Sake.

455
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,740
Well, then...

456
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,400
Sake will return to his hometown...

457
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Kameari...

458
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,940
He will come back!

459
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,840
Oh? Who do you think it is?

460
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,200
It's Yoko from the tobacco shop!

461
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,140
She is the junior high school student

462
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,800
and a womanizer!

463
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,720
I've become a good wife!

464
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,220
I've been mistaken!

465
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,860
I remember!

466
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,160
The exhaust pipe from that time!

467
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,020
Next time, "A little while ago, the exhaust pipe!"

468
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,680
See you!

469
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,600
Kameari

470
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,780
Kameari

471
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,080
Kameari

472
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,160
Kameari

473
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,140
Kameari

474
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,180
Kameari

475
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,280
Kameari

476
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:23,900
Kameari
