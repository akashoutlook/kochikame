1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,220
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,940
Make sure to keep your room light and keep your distance

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:25,260
It's like someone's calling

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,220
After the rain

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,240
I walked looking back

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,440
I was drawn to Gacha

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,620
I felt it at that time

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,540
A strange feeling

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,440
So I tried walking on the black tile of the arcade

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:55,080
I tried walking on the black tile of the arcade

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,360
Everyone was a child once

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,680
But everyone forgets

13
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,260
Politicians with a great face

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt above their eyes

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,180
Turn around and look at that corner

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,840
You can meet everyone

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,560
There is a wall over there

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,340
There must be a wall

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,560
Everyone come to our town

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,620
Thank you!

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
Komachi Big Break

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,260
Everyone come to our town

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,280
Komachi Big Break

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,320
Everyone come to our town

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,080
There must be a many children

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,660
Who are you

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,260
Komachi Big Break

28
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,140
That's why I don't have a wife.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,840
What? I don't want to hear that from you.

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,720
That's right. You're saying too much.

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,080
That's right. That's right.

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm really sorry.

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,320
Look at this before you start talking.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,620
Wow! Nagagawa!

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,540
You two look good together.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,880
How is it, Komachi?

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,600
Compared to Nagagawa and Reiko, who have this refreshing image,

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
what do you think is the most miserable thing about you?

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,600
If you ask me, I think it's...

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,180
I think so too.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,040
No way.

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,240
You're completely destroying the image of the Katsushika office!

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,260
Ryo-chikan, Kichi-me, look at me now!

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm going to do it when I have to!

45
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,940
Wow!

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,240
W... What are you doing, Komachi?

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,280
You're so pretty!

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,700
How can you be?

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,340
I think that can happen anytime.

50
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,660
It's your turn, Imetsu!

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,560
Now you can have a look at me.

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,560
Phew...

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
I feel like I've been reborn.

54
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,840
I didn't know that gathering everyone's attention was so exciting.

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,120
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,760
I'm the cameraman of the weekly YYBOY.

57
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,700
Cameraman?

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,020
Yes. Actually, I'm going to do a project called "A cool girl found in the city".

59
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,500
I'd like you to take a picture with me.

60
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,360
Sure, just one.

61
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,680
Thank you.

62
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,660
What? Best 1?

63
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,980
A cool girl found in the city?

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,840
The first in the calculation. Isn't that amazing, Komachi?

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,680
What's going on? I didn't know that a mountain fox like this would be chosen as the best 1.

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
What do you mean by a mountain fox? It means that people in the world are looking at it.

67
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,740
Oh, Director.

68
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,420
Hey, Komachi.

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,420
I'm Kasushi.

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,820
You've contributed a lot to the image-up of the magazine.

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,480
I'll be counting on you from now on.

72
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,760
We're all very proud of you as a same-sex worker.

73
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,560
That's right.

74
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,260
What?

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,460
What?

76
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,280
There she is.

77
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,640
Where?

78
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,500
I found her.

79
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:01,800
Where?

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,380
In this house.

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,520
Damn it.

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,040
Look here.

83
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,020
You idiot.

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,600
What?

85
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,660
She was a hero.

86
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,840
I'm in trouble.

87
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,420
What's going on?

88
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,560
What's going on?

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,300
How did this happen?

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,440
What's going on?

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,020
It's a big mess.

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,600
Everyone's here to interview Komachi.

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,540
What?

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,040
What a fool.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,460
It's the era when idols close to you are more popular than the stars you don't have.

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,300
I... I'm in trouble.

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,460
Please come this way.

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
Yes, you can.

99
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,620
No.

100
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,640
Please make this much for me.

101
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,480
This way, please.

102
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,280
You're already in trouble.

103
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:39,980
Yes.

104
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,820
Yes.

105
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,980
Here you are.

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
That's theって.

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,720
You've put it there.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,340
G folders now.

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,420
She's a real soba girl!

110
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,780
Isn't she nice?

111
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,060
That's a piece of cake.

112
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,740
Give it back to me.

113
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,660
I've got it.

114
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,800
I'll...

115
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,380
Then I'll leave it to you.

116
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,700
Excuse me.

117
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,120
Thank you.

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,200
The owner is quite the poet.

119
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,940
It's in this house.

120
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,000
I've just been told.

121
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,740
I found this.

122
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,640
You don't have to worry about such a thing.

123
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,720
I'll leave it to you.

124
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:09,800
Please come this way.

125
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,800
It's a good idea.

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,180
I see. I heard that you are very popular

127
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,880
Sugiyama, please have some coffee

128
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Yes

129
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,620
No, I'm fine with coffee

130
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:20,980
Yes

131
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,720
Anyway, it's time for the neon light

132
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,140
What?

133
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,180
It's neon

134
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,300
Neon

135
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,320
Neon

136
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,480
Oh, I see

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,600
I see

138
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,200
That's funny

139
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,800
Well, Ryotsu-san, I think you'll be satisfied with the character

140
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,440
You are not the character, you are me

141
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm just your heart

142
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Yes, I know

143
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:02,300
What? I'm in the commercial?

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,660
You have a high voice

145
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,460
You still don't know what you're doing

146
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm still in the process of getting hired

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,680
Don't tell anyone

148
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,640
Anyway, since I became the manager, I'll sell you a lot, so leave it to me

149
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,360
Why are you the manager?

150
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,060
It's a general order to improve the image of the Katsushika office

151
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,060
General order?

152
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:24,900
Yes

153
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,540
I'm busy, but I can't go against the general order

154
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,200
I decided to be a man and take off my skin

155
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,980
General order?

156
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,440
General order?

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Hm, I think so

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,460
We stopped him

159
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,940
Then, I'll get to the real game

160
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,580
I'm Akutamaki

161
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,980
I'll arrest you

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,660
Komachi is also drinking

163
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,820
Gakken drink

164
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,660
Come on, here you are

165
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,180
Is that Komachi?

166
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,600
You're'm just like a stranger

167
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,880
Well, but you're a happy child

168
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm Akutamaki

169
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,040
I'll arrest you!

170
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm drinking too!

171
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,860
I'm drinking too!

172
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,500
Hey, show me again!

173
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,840
Hey, show me again!

174
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,140
That's right!

175
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
How many times do I have to see it?

176
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:18,740
How many times do I have to see it?

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,220
I'll arrest you!

178
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,460
That's right!

179
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,600
You're so cute!

180
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,420
You really are a girl.

181
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,500
You really are a girl.

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,480
You're much more beautiful than my daughter.

183
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,540
You're much more beautiful than my daughter.

184
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,700
Yes, that's right.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,500
Hey, did you do my commercial?

186
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,940
Yes, I did.

187
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
I've been watching it many times.

188
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,400
Hey, Kasuya.

189
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,260
Hey, Komachi.

190
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,120
My relatives are all from the village.

191
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm going to celebrate tonight.

192
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,140
I'm going to celebrate tonight.

193
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,620
That's embarrassing.

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,260
That's embarrassing.

195
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,640
That's embarrassing.

196
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,180
Mr. Ryozu, could you take a picture of Komachi?

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,280
Mr. Ryozu, could you take a picture of Komachi?

198
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,360
Well, I'll think about it.

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,980
Well, I'll think about it.

200
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
That's great, Komachi.

201
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,560
That's great, Komachi.

202
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,480
That's great, Komachi.

203
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,400
Komachi is my campaign girl.

204
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
Komachi is my campaign girl.

205
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Leave it to me!

206
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
Hurry up.

207
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Why are you so busy?

208
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,140
Why are you so busy?

209
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,540
Let me eat breakfast.

210
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,660
If you don't like the food, I'll give it to you.

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,640
If you don't like the food, I'll give it to you.

212
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,220
Komachi eating too.

213
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,040
Katsushika Mai

214
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,920
Thank you very much.

215
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,920
It's a sweet potato.

216
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,260
Sweet potato?

217
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,920
It's very heavy.

218
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,840
This looks delicious.

219
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,600
Sweet potato.

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,580
You're a bad boy.

221
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,680
You're a bad boy.

222
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,460
I'm not as bad as you.

223
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm not as bad as you.

224
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,800
What are you talking about?

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,180
If you don't get up, you'll be arrested.

226
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,700
I'm so tired.

227
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,640
I really feel tired.

228
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,740
I'm so tired.

229
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
This isn't going to work.

230
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,700
That's right.

231
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,400
This can be used to improve the image of the Ministry of Commerce.

232
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,080
This is the end of today's mission.

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,460
Please leave the information.

234
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,560
Thank you for your hard work!

235
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,000
Komachi-chan!

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,760
Thank you for your hard work!

237
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,840
Arita will do her best too!

238
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,200
Yes! Thank you!

239
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm tired...

240
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,260
Thank you for your hard work!

241
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,920
Idols are also very hard!

242
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,800
Komachi-san Watcher also appeared,

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,720
and it seems that the internet homepage also has great access.

244
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,680
But why are they so busy?

245
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,820
Maybe because it's the image-up month?

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Ryo-chan says so, but it's somewhat suspicious.

247
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,180
Ah!

249
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,540
Ah!

250
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,780
Komachi-chan, it's your work!

251
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,660
No! I'm tired.

252
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,300
Don't say that.

253
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,440
Komachi-chan is an idol in Japan now.

254
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
Idols are not easy.

255
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,760
Why don't you let him rest a little?

256
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,200
No, I have to earn money when I can.

257
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,880
Eh?

258
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,540
No, no, no, I have to earn money.

259
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
I have to earn money.

260
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,060
Come on, Komachi.

261
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,060
Come on, come on, come on.

262
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,540
What?

263
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:13,760
Huh?

264
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,400
License?

265
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,740
Hey, what are you doing with this?

266
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,960
That's Komachi-san's license contract.

267
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,820
I signed it with my senior's name.

268
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,860
I knew it.

269
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
Ryo-chan made money by using Komachi-chan, right?

270
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,260
No, it's not that...

271
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

272
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,400
You don't have to say anything more than me.

273
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,120
You're so greedy.

274
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,120
What's with this Yamazori?

275
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,060
He was quite an idol.

276
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,100
What?

277
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,540
I also let Mashiro do a lot of things.

278
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,340
Like you.

279
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,620
You can't be an idol if you don't know how to act.

280
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,460
You're lying.

281
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,060
You can't pretend to be an idol and play with a pure heart.

282
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Komachi-chan.

283
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,340
I don't know where the watcher is.

284
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,580
I don't know where the watcher is.

285
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,080
There she is.

286
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,880
What?

287
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,220
What's...

288
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,820
What's going on?

289
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,460
That idol Komachi-san is hugging a man.

290
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm in love.

291
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,520
What?

292
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,280
What?

293
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
Where did you two meet?

294
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,780
Where was your first date?

295
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
I was planning on getting married!

296
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,640
Why did this happen?

297
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,160
This is the Kameari Park Exhibition Hall.

298
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,640
As you can see, a lot of mass media is pushing for this.

299
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,340
I'm so worried!

300
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,120
Ono Komachi has found a lover!

301
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,980
His partner is the Chief of Police, Ryo-tsu Kankichi, who works at the Kameari Park Exhibition Hall.

302
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,580
He said he met Komachi-san when he was cleaning the Katsushika office.

303
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,440
They always go on dates at a French restaurant called P in Roppongi.

304
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,900
Did you really say that, Ryo-san?

305
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,160
Of course I did!

306
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,180
That's right, you gorilla!

307
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,180
What?

308
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,460
This newspaper also has comments about Komachi-chan's parents.

309
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,100
They said they met at the wedding.

310
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,020
That's just a rumor about his father.

311
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,100
But if you write it like this, it's hard to solve any misunderstanding.

312
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,420
No way!

313
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,220
This kind of thing is a rumor that's been going around for a long time.

314
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,180
That's the story of the planets they've never been to.

315
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,320
I don't mind if you write it like you've seen it there.

316
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,940
Ryo-sama!

317
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,960
Hey, Maria!

318
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,340
What the hell is this article about?

319
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,660
It's so much to say about me!

320
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:41,780
What?

321
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,180
That article is just all nonsense.

322
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:44,840
You idiot!

323
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,400
You idiot!

324
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,920
Ryo-sama's sidekick!

325
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,700
Wait, Maria!

326
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,600
Calm down!

327
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,560
What a surprise!

328
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,080
The new fact has been discovered!

329
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,960
Ryo-san's lover was Komachi-san's fiance, Ryo-san's idol, Junsacho!

330
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,080
No!

331
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,060
No!

332
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,540
Ryo-sama!

333
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,140
Maria!

334
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,880
No!

335
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,700
What's your name?

336
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm Maria!

337
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,800
What?

338
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,280
What?

339
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,620
What?

340
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:06,860
What?

341
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,180
What?

342
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,700
Ryo-san and Junsacho are in a relationship?

343
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,840
Yes.

344
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,180
What's your relationship?

345
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
We've been together before.

346
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,900
Maria!

347
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:17,820
What?

348
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,680
This is nonsense!

349
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
No, it's not!

350
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,660
Listen up, everyone!

351
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,060
Maria is a man!

352
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,560
This is a shocking confession!

353
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Ryo-san and Junsacho's lover was a man!

354
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
A man?

355
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,660
What does that mean?

356
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:59,080
A man is one who is playback, a man thinks whatever he can.

357
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,560
Ryo, is what Maria said true?

358
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,680
No, it's not true.

359
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,740
What about me?

360
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,560
You forgot about Komachi.

361
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,020
In this difficult time,

362
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,900
a hero loved by both men and women,

363
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
his name is Ryo Tsukkankichi.

364
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,280
Kokomo.

365
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
Kokomo.

366
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,760
Kokomo.

367
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,280
Ryo is everywhere on TV.

368
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,940
Not only on TV.

369
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,200
He's also on "Women Weekly".

370
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,180
He's not on TV anymore.

371
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,380
I feel sorry for Komachi.

372
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,560
He's on "Men's Fashion magazine".

373
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,540
"Ganimata Tanso is the charm of men".

374
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,380
"The era is Ryo-tsu".

375
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,480
Today, we will introduce the Ryo Tsukkankichi's

376
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,720
Ryo Tsukkankichi goods.

377
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,580
It's called "Kankichi Tsunagari Mayege".

378
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,480
I'll put it on.

379
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,840
How is it?

380
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:56,760
Great.

381
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,120
It's manly and wonderful.

382
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,380
And now,

383
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,200
I'll put on this Kankichi sandal.

384
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,800
It's a must-have item to show manliness.

385
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Now, please call us.

386
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,220
From today, you are also a Ryo Tsukkankichi.

387
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,500
What should we do?

388
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,100
Please cut Ryo-tsu.

389
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,380
Kankichi is popular now.

390
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,200
It's very cool.

391
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Ryo Tsukkankichi to the Best Genius Show.

392
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,620
Tokyo's specialty, Ryo Tsukkankichi.

393
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,800
Ryo san.

394
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,400
Source key holder.

395
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,380
Ryo san of sleepiness.

396
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm sleeping.

397
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,520
Don't touch me.

398
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,160
Ryo tsukkankichi of gentleman.

399
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,780
When today's Ryo Tsukkankichi.

400
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:35,900
Science Chi KNo lights.

401
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
This is a photo album of Ryo Tsukkankichi.

402
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,520
Many people have been interested in Ryo Tsukkankichi.

403
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,400
That idiot.

404
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,940
What does it mean?

405
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,420
I'm in trouble!

406
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh, my.

407
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,180
I can't stop thinking about the left and right.

408
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,880
Oh, Daisuke is here.

409
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm home.

410
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,220
Welcome home, Grandpa!

411
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
Oh, Daisuke.

412
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
You've grown up.

413
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,500
Let me hold you.

414
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,080
Here.

415
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,780
There's something good for you, Grandpa.

416
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,460
What is it?

417
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,120
It's fine, Grandpa.

418
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,700
Please stop it.

419
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
Ryo-chan, the hero who is loved by both women and men.

420
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,540
I will defeat the weak!

421
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,980
The times have been waiting for me!

422
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,900
You've become a very popular person, Ryo-chan.

423
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm like my senior.

424
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,360
So there are more and more people who want to pet gorillas.

425
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,500
I see.

426
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,080
What are you thinking about?

427
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,400
It's the end of the century.

428
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,280
It's a sad thing.

429
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,220
Chief!

430
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,580
The TV station wants to interview Ryo-san's boss.

431
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,640
What?

432
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,340
Me?

433
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,100
I'll do it!

434
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,800
Start!

435
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Well, um...

436
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
Ryo-chan and Ryo-chan...

437
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,680
I've been in trouble since he was assigned...

438
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,800
No, no, no.

439
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,420
Ryo-chan and Kanchichi are the mirror of the TOH Katsushika.

440
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,920
This is also a story.

441
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,460
It's the result of my daily education.

442
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,400
Don't forget Tonda Gomez, Tonda Gomez!

443
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,320
Toh Katsushika

444
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,300
Toh Katsushika

445
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,280
Toh Katsushika

446
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,740
Toh Katsushika

447
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,500
Toh Katsushika

448
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,040
Toh Katsushika

449
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:47,060
Toh Katsushika

450
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,120
Hey.

451
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,160
What's this?

452
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,640
Ryo-chan and Kanchichi are both here.

453
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,820
It was a small town until recently.

454
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,580
What was that?

455
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,820
Ryo-chan and Kanchichi!

456
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,120
Please shake hands!

457
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:00,980
What?

458
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,540
Please let me touch the eyebrows of the actor.

459
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Okay, go ahead.

460
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,560
It's hard to be popular.

461
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,600
If you want to be popular like me,

462
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,720
you'd better buy these Ryo-chan goods.

463
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,400
What?

464
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,140
You're in a good mood.

465
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,060
What?

466
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,740
I thought it was someone else.

467
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,560
Well...

468
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,000
Who was it?

469
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,560
I remember Fukie-san was an idol

470
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,720
and something like that.

471
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
But I don't remember who it was.

472
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,820
I don't remember.

473
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,880
I don't remember.

474
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,480
How is it, Ryo-san?

475
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,820
It's a pretty good work, isn't it?

476
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,700
It's like looking in the mirror.

477
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
Ryo-chan and Kanchichi's original

478
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,660
one-in-a-half figures are perfect.

479
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,960
But Ryo-san,

480
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,960
I'm sure it'll be okay this time.

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,440
I was a failure before.

482
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,360
There's no mistake this time!

483
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,940
If you want to make money now,

484
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,100
you'll be able to sell anything.

485
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,100
I'll make a million copies for the time being.

486
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,960
I'll invest all my assets in this.

487
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,840
First of all,

488
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,260
I'll use a TV or magazine to do an overall commercial.

489
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,120
Ryo-san,

490
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm counting on you!

491
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
A girl was waiting.

492
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,820
I was crying. A man cried.

493
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,260
Ryo's Kankichi Original 1/1 Complete Figure.

494
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,620
Tomorrow, it will be available all over Japan.

495
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,520
Today is finally the day it will be released.

496
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,740
Senpai is very determined, but is it really okay to make a million of them?

497
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,900
Look! On TV, Ryoko Yoshikawa is interviewed about Ryo's figure.

498
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,760
What?

499
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,700
It's about Ryoko, who is popular and sensitive.

500
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,900
So, you can buy the popular Ryo-tsu figure right away.

501
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,200
What? Me?

502
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,680
If you say you want Ryoko, it's a panic.

503
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,760
Yes.

504
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,120
I don't like Ryo because he's a little grumpy.

505
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,960
Ryo is ugly and stinky.

506
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,720
I don't like him.

507
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm not interested.

508
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,140
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

509
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
This is...

510
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,160
That one word of Ryoko...

511
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,040
It's a good idea.

512
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,120
That's not a boom.

513
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,020
You can't go because you're greedy.

514
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,520
Oh no!

515
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,220
What's wrong, Terai?

516
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,080
There he is!

517
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,760
What's going on?

518
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,280
This time, I'm being chased by the media!

519
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,340
What?

520
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,540
This figure and his face make me feel bad.

521
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,920
What?

522
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,220
This time, Terai's boom?

523
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,960
Hello!

524
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,420
Sorry, it's time! Please wake up!

525
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's right!

526
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, look.

527
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
A bird is flying!

528
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,400
That's ridiculous!

529
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm so stupid! What happened to my part?

530
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,780
Now, I will give you a present.

531
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,620
Now, the prize is 8 million yen for Nauna Young's popular "Erai-san Keyholder".

532
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,200
I told you, there's no such thing.

533
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,560
If you make a mistake, don't send me a postcard.

534
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,900
Got it?

535
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,020
I won!

536
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,740
An idol climbing documentary?

537
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,100
What's that?

538
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,060
What? The part-time job for that film is 8,000 yen?

539
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,520
Leave it to me.

540
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,100
I will show you the video with my sense of power and realism.

541
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,220
Next time, I'm a video cameraman.

542
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,520
Thank you for watching.
