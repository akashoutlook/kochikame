The infinite universe

It is said that there are unknown intelligent life forms there

No, maybe they are

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,660
They may be right next to us

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,280
Time stop!

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,940
Finally, the day I've been waiting for has come!

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,020
Where are you going, Ryotsu?

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm patrolling, chief

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,940
What is this circle?

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,360
Nothing, chief

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,760
Oh, you didn't go to buy game software, Ryotsu

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,100
Game software?

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,340
No, I said something bad

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,040
Ryotsu!

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,320
Let me go, chief

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,440
Today is the launch day of Doikura Five, which I've been waiting for

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,140
Idiot!

41
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,560
What are you talking about while you are working?

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,700
Do you know what position you are as a policeman?

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,040
I know!

44
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,200
I know, so I put up with the fact that I have to line up in front of the store at night and I paid the night shift

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,480
That's obvious

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,540
Don't be so mean!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,860
If you buy it, I'll be back in 30 seconds, chief

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,680
Shut up!

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
We are here, and I think it will be no problem if you get out of the way a little

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,220
If it's a store in front of the station, it's faster to go by bicycle, isn't it, Ryotsu?

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,620
Yes, sir!

52
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,540
I'm sure your shift was until noon, Ryotsu

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,180
Yes, chief! It's only two minutes to the time of the shift

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,240
I don't know if I can go home after the shift

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,940
Well, do your best on your shift

56
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes, sir!

57
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,780
I'm telling you to continue your shift seriously!

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,640
You're so mean, chief!

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,120
Ouch, ouch, ouch

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
What?

61
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,660
What?

62
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,640
Hey, guys, something...

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,580
Reiko! Nakagawa!

64
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,300
Terai!

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,200
Chief!

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,760
It's stuck...

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,580
What's going on?

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,660
Did you find out the cause of the breakdown?

69
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,880
I knew it, it's the power supply

70
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,200
Maybe this mean it's broken

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,780
Why not...

72
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,820
Okay, here we go

73
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,840
Three more corners down to the nearby most standing

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,100
You are always in a hurry to have your drinks, so you are short of fuel

75
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,120
I also wanted to drink it

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,940
What are you doing?

77
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,640
It's crushed!

78
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,920
Sorry!

79
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,040
Terrible

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,740
What's this?

81
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,360
What's with this guy?

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,440
So this is what you were doing earlier?

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,140
Where did you get this huge fish?

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,620
Stop it, Rookie!

85
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,620
This isn't a fish, it's an spaceship!

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,880
A spaceship? If this is a spaceship, then you guys are aliens!

87
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,080
You're not like those unsold manzai-combi-like people!

88
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,160
You're an alien, aren't you?

89
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,400
You're not like this, are you?

90
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,180
You're not like this, are you?

91
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,320
There's no such thing as an alien!

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,640
But why is this guy the only one who's moving when the time stop machine stopped all the movement on Earth?

93
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,660
The time stop machine?

94
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,820
So this is what you guys are doing?

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,160
It's not good to be seen as us, so we stopped time.

96
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,080
So you guys are really aliens?

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,300
That's what I've been saying!

98
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,260
You're the one who told us!

99
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
You're very annoying!

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,300
Ouch!

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,500
Is it the fuel data?

102
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,940
No, it's not.

103
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,280
This isn't the fuel.

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,900
Didn't you just say it's the fuel?

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,840
Why?

106
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,760
What's that here?

107
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,700
Beer, Japanese sake, soju, whiskey?

108
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,340
Is it mizuku kidding, m verdant, though?

109
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,760
I guess it's Mr. Sparrow's seaweed salad.

110
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,100
I thought it was the food at the bar.

111
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,540
And, from the list of elements,

112
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm sure we can make almost the same amount of real fuel with the same amount of fuel.

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,580
If you help us, we can leave immediately and move the time we stopped.

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,060
Wait, so the time has stopped.

115
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,180
The game software is not sold yet.

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
All right, let's help them.

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,520
I'll take care of it.

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,900
It's like looking at a diorama of a real thing.

119
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,400
Where is the fuel?

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,880
There's a limit to where we can go, so we should be able to get it there.

121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
Oh, no!

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
The car has stopped, so it's okay.

123
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,960
It's going to be drawn as soon as the time starts moving.

124
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,660
Ouch!

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,340
What the hell is this?

126
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,860
Oh, it fell from the air.

127
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,040
I'll help you now.

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,560
If you move the things that have stopped, the future will change, so the time is banned.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,700
I won't let you go.

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,580
You aliens don't have a ninja.

131
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,260
Damn it, it won't move.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,740
We can't move things that have stopped in the air.

133
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
Come with us!

134
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,140
Is this okay?

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,420
No, this is a futon.

136
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,500
You guys should put it on top of it.

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
This will be a cushion.

138
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,920
Where's the Molokyu?

139
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,540
If there's a Molokyu...

140
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,520
You guys are doing something else.

141
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,280
Is that the Molokyu?

142
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,000
I see.

143
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,540
No, it's not.

144
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,940
I'll do it like this.

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,960
I'll help you.

146
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
You guys help me too.

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,980
What's this this time?

148
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,580
This isn't a Molokyu.

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,520
I want you to take me to a place where there are Nennets.

150
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,860
I'm tired already.

151
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,580
On Earth, there's a saying, "You can't eat what you can't work with."

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay, that's good.

153
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,220
If you do this, you'll be caught as soon as you start moving.

154
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,640
Are we going to go on a trip again?

155
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,080
If you can't...

156
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,060
Shut up!

157
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,020
The kids are drowning.

158
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,880
Damn it.

159
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,260
No good.

160
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,700
The water's completely frozen.

161
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,640
If this happens...

162
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,420
For now, it's urgent.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,020
What a bad person.

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,380
By the way...

165
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,020
Here's a bonus.

166
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,480
I brought a coach from a nearby swimming school.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
Put this next to you.

168
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,560
Okay.

169
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,700
It's fine if you put this as a gun.

170
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,420
Now the list is all set.

171
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,220
I'm glad we were able to get to the point.

172
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,380
We can continue our journey now.

173
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm glad I met a good person!

174
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,580
Pay the money!

175
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,080
There's no such thing!

176
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,020
What?

177
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,140
It's the middle of a space trip that relies on everyone's love and kindness.

178
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm on my way to the space trip, so I can only rely on you.

179
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
Oh, well.

180
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,400
How much is it all?

181
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,940
You look peaceful, so I'll leave the money here.

182
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,560
I put it all in.

183
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,060
I can stop it with this.

184
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,100
I've done a lot of things for you.

185
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,280
I won't forget this favor.

186
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,840
You don't have to forget it, but if you pay the money you just exchanged, you'll double it and come back.

187
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,640
I know, Rookie.

188
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,920
Then you have to move the time after I say yes.

189
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,120
You really got in the way of me earlier, Chief.

190
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, that's it.

191
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,060
I'll forgive you with this.

192
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,020
Z ك:

193
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,140
It's unbelievable that you saw a human fly like that.

194
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,920
Anyway, let's hurry.

195
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,920
You did a good job.

196
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,860
Where is the friendly person?

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,920
There.

198
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,060
Are you okay?

199
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,220
Yes.

200
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

201
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,080
AAAAAAAAH!

202
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,520
Uwaaah!

203
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,060
AAAAAAAAH!

204
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,040
AAAAAAAAH!

205
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,060
Help! Help!

206
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,500
It's too hard!

207
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,860
W-What happened?!

208
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,520
...

209
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,920
...

210
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,780
...

211
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:06,900
...

212
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,520
...

213
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
...

214
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,480
...

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,140
...

216
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,500
...

217
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,920
...

218
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,540
...

219
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,740
...

220
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:22,280
A-An error!!

221
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,440
...

222
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,560
...

223
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,480
...

224
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,020
...

225
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,280
...

226
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,320
...

227
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,100
The... the Katsudon I ordered...

228
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,240
The Katsudon hasn't arrived yet?

229
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,160
It seems like it hasn't arrived yet.

230
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
Can we check without the Katsudon?

231
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,860
S-sorry.

232
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,140
It's me. I don't think I can pass today.

233
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,460
I don't think so.

234
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,580
You're the worst! I told you it was early!

235
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,000
I need to change my license...

236
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,160
Dad... isn't that you?

237
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,380
Masayoshi...

238
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
Wait, Dad! Where have you been all this time?

239
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,580
Dad! Mom and Grandma are worried about you!

240
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,720
Dad...

241
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:25,960
Dad...

242
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,980
Alright!

243
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,540
Alright!

244
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,640
Hey!

245
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,540
I'm sorry about that!

246
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm so sorry!

247
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm sorry!

248
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm sorry!

249
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,320
Hey! I'm the one who made you cry!

250
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,940
Damn it! I don't want to lose!

251
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,640
How much is it, old man?

252
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,900
It's sold out. What a shame.

253
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,620
No way!

254
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,280
I won't forget this award!

255
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,620
Shut up!

256
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,060
Mom!

257
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,820
Mom!

258
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,180
It's mine!

259
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,680
Mom!

260
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,140
I won't lose!

261
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,040
I won't lose!

262
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,320
Old Man!

263
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,040
When was your happiest time?

264
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,480
When you were eating delicious food?

265
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,160
When you accomplished something with study and work?

266
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,640
When you achieve something by doing something.

267
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,720
When you spend time with your family and lover.

268
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,400
This is the story of a man named Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

269
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,440
He is going through such a small happiness.

270
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,400
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

271
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
Nothing good happened recently.

272
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,180
I lost in the race.

273
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,480
Damn it!

274
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,580
I can't get a ticket.

275
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,260
What the hell are you doing?

276
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,320
I don't have money, but I'm hungry.

277
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:38,740
Ryo-san, that milk is old.

278
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,980
Tell me that quickly.

279
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,580
I think it's yogurt.

280
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,260
Damn it!

281
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,540
Are you okay, senpai?

282
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,800
I put things on the floor.

283
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,620
Biscuits?

284
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,500
It's Reiko's.

285
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,860
I'll have lunch with her.

286
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,920
If you eat it without permission, Reiko-san will scold you, Ryo-san.

287
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
It's delicious.

288
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm home.

289
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,820
Ryo-chan, is that...

290
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,720
Don't be so stingy.

291
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,220
This biscuit is delicious.

292
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
That's a snack for pets, Ryo-chan.

293
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,840
What?

294
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,640
Why do you have such a thing?

295
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,800
My cat is constipated, so I bought it at the pet shop this morning.

296
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,700
It's empty.

297
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,960
If I put it there, I can imagine that I might eat it.

298
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,240
I can imagine that I might eat it.

299
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,160
You're not a baby.

300
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,280
You can decide for yourself if it's good or not.

301
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,620
What?

302
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,680
I don't know what's inside the milk.

303
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
But I can't eat it.

304
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,040
Damn it.

305
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,800
Are you hungry?

306
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,480
Are you okay, Ryo-chan?

307
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,200
I'm hungry.

308
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,700
I'm hungry.

309
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm hungry.

310
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,920
I'm hungry.

311
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,540
I'm hungry.

312
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm hungry.

313
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,100
I'm hungry.

314
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm hungry.

315
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,940
I'm hungry.

316
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,480
What? A lunch box?

317
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Hurry up.

318
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,840
Go.

319
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,680
Okay.

320
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,160
Ryo-chan.

321
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,260
It's too late.

322
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,900
If you take medicine all at once, it's poisonous to your body.

323
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,320
I think you should go to the doctor, Ryo-chan.

324
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,820
Can you say that you're too hungry that you ate too much of the food for the pets?

325
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,580
Go inside.

326
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,100
It's a lunch box.

327
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,580
You shouldn't force yourself to eat, Senpai.

328
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,900
That's right, Ryo-san.

329
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,340
That's right, Ryo-san.

330
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,380
Don't worry about it.

331
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,560
It's better to eat a lot as long as you're strong.

332
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,020
Yummy.

333
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,140
Senpai.

334
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,080
Ryo-chan.

335
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,940
Ryo-san.

336
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
Go to the doctor, okay?

337
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,160
Your face is not pretty, senpai.

338
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,340
I went to the restroom 10 times.

339
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,500
It's commonplace.

340
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,240
You're eating too much, so you're coming out too much, senpai.

341
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,960
I see.

342
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,280
I thought I would lose my stamina if I came out, but

343
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,780
maybe I made a mistake.

344
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,520
Ryo-chan.

345
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,220
Take your water.

346
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,120
There.

347
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,960
Here you are again.

348
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,660
I can't give you any stimulus.

349
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,000
Ryo-chan!

350
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,500
That was a little stimulus, but it's still good for me.

351
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

352
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,040
I'll blow it up when it's fully opened.

353
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,600
What's this?

354
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,080
That's...

355
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,920
It's a water pipe, senpai!

356
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,200
A water pipe?

357
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,360
I was told that there was a water pipe construction at 1:00 this afternoon.

358
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,500
I forgot!

359
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,520
It's only 1:00 now.

360
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,300
I can't use the toilet anymore!

361
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,060
Ryo-chan...

362
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,300
What's this?

363
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,740
There should still be water in the water tank in the toilet.

364
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,940
Terai!

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,360
It's a water break at 1:00.

366
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,020
Terai just poured water.

367
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,140
But it was the last drink.

368
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,040
I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

369
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,680
I've been holding back on using the toilet for a long time.

370
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,740
How long does a water break take?

371
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,480
Three hours.

372
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,240
Three hours...

373
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
Ryo-chan!

374
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,660
Senpai!

375
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,540
Ryo-san!

376
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,920
This is the waste dump.

377
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,800
And this is the area where the water breaks.

378
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,000
We have no choice but to go outside the water break area.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,300
If we go to the third exit, we can borrow a toilet.

380
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
It's about 500 meters long by straight line.

381
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,460
I'll send you a car, senpai.

382
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,140
No.

383
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,040
It's stupid to sit on the seat.

384
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,720
It reacts sensitively to the slight vibration of the car.

385
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,500
It's better to walk on my own.

386
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,540
Be careful, Ryo-chan!

387
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:27,980
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,380
It's like carrying a nitro bomb.

389
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,380
You guys...

390
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,340
You're good kids, so let's walk along the three ends.

391
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,660
A group of elementary school students are approaching about 30 meters ahead of Senpai.

392
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,360
Please prepare yourselves.

393
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,840
The other students' behavior is unpredictable.

394
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,720
Ryo-chan...

395
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,340
Ryo-chan.

396
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,180
I'll look after them with my belt!

397
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,140
What's that?

398
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,080
A dump's approaching at tens of meters from the rear!

399
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,360
Please be careful of the vibration!

400
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,880
What is the point of being careful of the vibration?

401
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm somehow safe...

402
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,660
Senpai!

403
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,480
Uh... this time...

404
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,600
Bingo is heading that way!

405
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,240
Why at a time like this...

406
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,900
I can't keep up with this movement...

407
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,840
Ryo-san!

408
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,620
Senpai, this time it's Danjizuma!

409
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,460
What?

410
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,660
What?

411
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
It's a good thing, right?

412
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,280
What should I do...

413
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,120
I'm so screwed!

414
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,980
I'm so close to the limit...

415
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,440
Thank you for your cooperation!

416
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,920
Ryo-san, calm down!

417
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,900
A little more...

418
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,660
Just a little more...

419
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,700
I'll do my best...

420
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,040
Alright!

421
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,200
I'm patrolling!

422
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,300
No way!

423
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,660
No!

424
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,820
The key's stuck!

425
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Senpai!

426
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,800
He's losing his mind!

427
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,100
No! Nakagawa-kun!

428
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,280
Let's find a house that'll lend us a toilet!

429
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,240
Let's find a house that'll lend us a toilet!

430
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,500
Yes!

431
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,880
Toilet...

432
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,900
Toilet...

433
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,480
I'm so sorry!

434
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,700
Sorry!

435
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm sorry!

436
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,620
Toilet...

437
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,640
Toilet...

438
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,700
Toilet!

439
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,240
Damn it!

440
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,420
No...

441
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,180
No...

442
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,340
What should I do!?

443
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,200
I have to find a house that'll lend us a toilet!

444
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,160
No!

445
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,940
Huh?

446
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,620
What kind of dream?

447
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,660
Take this!

448
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:40,680
What?

449
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,560
You too...

450
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,900
Good.

451
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,860
I am glad you found another house.

452
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,260
We're waiting.

453
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,300
No, no, don't hold it back!

454
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,760
Hurry up!

455
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,860
No!

456
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,800
Don't come near me!

457
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,420
-Senpai! -Ryo!

458
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,520
-Don't come any closer! -Come on!

459
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,180
There you are! Get lost!

460
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,400
-Ryo! -Senpai!

461
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,420
At last!

462
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,120
Help!

463
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't take this!

464
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:40,540
You're hungry, so don't eat anything around here!

465
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
Take care of your stomach!

466
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm hungry, so I'll eat something.

467
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,760
I'm hungry, so I'll eat something.

468
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,940
I'm hungry, so I'll eat something.

469
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,780
I'm hungry, so I'll eat something.

470
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,220
I'm hungry, so I'll eat something.

471
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:06,460
You built a new home? That's great!

472
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,960
Where is it? Is it on the border?

473
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
I don't know.

474
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,960
Can't you come by car?

475
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,200
Hey, where is your home?

476
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,380
Next time!

477
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,780
Haruka Nara's Temple Rites.

478
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,840
Look out for us!

479
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
My Home
