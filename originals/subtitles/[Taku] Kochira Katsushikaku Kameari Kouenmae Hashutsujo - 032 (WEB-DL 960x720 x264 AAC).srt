The End

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
Ryo, I'm in training now.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,160
Good morning.

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,120
Don't be so scared!

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm surprised.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,780
What's wrong, Ryo?

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,700
The truth is...

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,500
Hm?

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,320
Ryo is trying to get money from the president.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,660
I asked him with a serious face, so I lent him the money.

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,820
I have the money next week, but I don't have any money.

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,700
How much did you lend me?

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,040
About 70,000 yen.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,520
70,000 yen?

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,940
Ouch! What are you doing?

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,860
Chief!

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,260
You're a rich man!

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm not a rich man. I don't want to be pulled out of the castle.

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,880
When did you get the money?

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,020
I read it in the newspaper.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,200
Is that wrong?

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,120
Maybe it's my misunderstanding.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,620
I'll call you even if you die!

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,600
Ouch!

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,480
I'm more reluctant to love than usual today, chief.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,340
Of course!

45
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,500
You tricked the director and borrowed the money.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,060
You tricked the director?

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,620
That's why I bought a 70,000 yen plum.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,220
What?

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,920
Chief, please don't misunderstand.

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,200
I bought this with the money I had.

51
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,700
Really?

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:52,880
Of course!

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey, you!

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,060
Get in bed and lie down.

55
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,020
Inside, your arms.

56
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,880
Yes, sir.

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,420
Yes, sir.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,900
How can I do this?

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Excuse me.

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,160
From tomorrow, you are going to be from my place.

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,400
It won't take long.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm going to go train as a diver and take the money from you.

63
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,440
Does that sound like me?

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Yes.

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,340
My master said you're not the best at it.

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,780
Okay.

67
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,260
Thank you, everyone.

68
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,480
Please take care of my training.

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,940
Look, Ryosuke!

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm only asking for your help.

71
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm doing what I like.

72
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,860
Get out of here!

73
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,560
What is all this?

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,500
I've been wearing this for 10 days.

75
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,580
I can't sleep well when I change my pillow.

76
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,820
You're not going to the Amazon.

77
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,400
Show me.

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,260
Do you think you can train with this?

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,040
That's why I'm trying to be myself so that I don't feel like playing.

80
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,420
Shut up.

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,340
I'll take care of everything.

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,100
I understand.

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm a man of my word.

84
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,420
I think you'll get it back anytime.

85
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
Mr. Ryotsu.

86
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,540
Yes.

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,120
I'll name you Chinnen instead of Zoku.

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,540
Chinnen?

89
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,840
Then I'll name you Sennen and Mannen.

90
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,780
These two are Chinnen's teachers.

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
Start training now.

92
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,380
Thank you.

93
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,400
You guys...

94
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,600
Please.

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,200
We've been training for a week.

96
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm Zannen.

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm Munen.

98
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,720
Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,120
You're eating the same food.

100
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,520
Let's get along.

101
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,940
Just leave it to me.

102
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,840
Yes.

103
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,360
Throw away Zannen from your head.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,460
You'll sit in the chair without regret.

105
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,120
Start.

106
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,820
You've been trapped in Zannen.

107
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,800
Why do you know?

108
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,160
If you train like me,

109
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,340
you'll understand what people like you think.

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,660
I know.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,180
I know.

112
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,520
What?

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,540
You just thought I was lying, didn't you?

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,600
I didn't think so.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
Don't make things up.

116
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong with you?

117
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,360
What the hell are you talking about?

118
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,000
What?

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,240
I'll beat you.

120
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,940
Don't underestimate me.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
Damn it.

122
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
I'll kill you!

123
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,340
I'll kill you!

124
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,220
You!

125
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,180
You!

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
The temple is under unlawful authority.

127
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,620
So you can't come here.

128
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,320
They're running away!

129
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,600
Um...

130
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,880
Glory!

131
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,420
Rise!

132
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
Y-You did it wrong!

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,760
I thought you could cut my heart off!

134
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,120
Just get changed and let's go.

135
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,840
Unfortunately, I'm the manager,

136
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,640
so please take care of the corridor.

137
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,280
Damn!

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,580
Now that Maruta's pillow is this bad,

139
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,160
why are you telling me to stay here?

140
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,940
Can you believe how long I've always been hiding

141
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,060
The corridor of this temple is very difficult.

142
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,780
The front part is more hazy, so you can't see, right?

143
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,880
Wait, wait!

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,500
It would be a waste of time to do that.

145
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,500
But...

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,320
Yeah.

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,000
If you make a lot of corridors like this, you can finish it in one go, right?

148
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,060
You go that way. I'll go this way.

149
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,740
But if you do this, the platform will...

150
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,380
The platform is scary and you'll get hit.

151
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,500
If you go around at full speed, you'll finish in 5 minutes.

152
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,860
Go that way!

153
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,320
What? You're done already?

154
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Yes, completely.

155
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,040
Don't be stupid. I'm not done yet.

156
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,620
It's only been 5 minutes, right?

157
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,240
That's over, meow.

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,100
Okay, if you say that, I'll check it out.

159
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,560
But if you're lying, you'd better be prepared.

160
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,860
Yes, sir.

161
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,280
Here, eat, eat.

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
What's this?

163
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,760
Is this all?

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,200
It's just food and a pee.

165
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,060
It's a temple's specialty, so we don't use meat or fish.

166
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,260
Vegetables and all that stuff are the same as Kirigiri.

167
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,920
You're really putting up with it.

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,480
It can't be helped.

169
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,900
This is also a training.

170
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,860
Now, let's eat.

171
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,180
I hid it in my pants and brought it here.

172
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,960
You guys can eat it, too.

173
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,920
No, no.

174
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,380
It's forbidden to eat meat.

175
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,560
I'll give you a punishment. A punishment.

176
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,220
I see.

177
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,200
That's all you've got.

178
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,740
If you guys don't eat it, I'll eat it all by myself.

179
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's eat.

180
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,860
It's delicious?

181
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,300
You guys really don't need to eat.

182
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,580
Let's eat.

183
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,620
Thanks...

184
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,620
Good.

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
That's right.

186
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
That's right. You have to be honest with your desire.

187
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,520
You guys have a good view.

188
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,560
What are you doing?

189
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,520
I'm sorry, Master Chen.

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,280
It's a pity that the guy has a terrible feeling.

191
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,440
I stopped him desperately, but he didn't listen to me at all.

192
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,080
No way. This is Mr. Chen.

193
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,420
Shut up!

194
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,540
You can't blame someone like that.

195
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,220
Cut!

196
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,460
I'm responsible for the company.

197
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,180
You can sit in the corridor until nightfall.

198
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
No way.

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,800
Cut!

200
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,620
Damn it. My legs are stiff.

201
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,920
I should sit in the corridor.

202
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,180
Now I say.

203
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,040
You guys should be responsible for this.

204
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,000
You're the ones that must help me go to sleep when I'm sleepy.

205
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,100
I don't have a good sleep.

206
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,280
You guys think I'm a bad sleeper?

207
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,300
We don't have a good sleeper.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm not sleeping right now.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
It's so annoying.

210
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,720
I have got nothing else to do but sleep!

211
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm not sleeping!

212
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,360
You've got nothing to do but sleep.

213
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,860
Never let me sleep!

214
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,080
Stop it.

215
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,480
I can't go.

216
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,380
It's okay. It's night.

217
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,160
If we get through here, we'll be...

218
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,980
What? A cat?

219
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,800
It's a big cat.

220
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,860
No way...

221
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,840
No way!

222
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,480
No way!

223
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,940
We can't go on like this.

224
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,420
Piranha!

225
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,360
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b!

226
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,100
Hey, Jin!

227
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,900
I won't let you escape!

228
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,920
That's not what I meant!

229
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,760
Please do something about them!

230
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,340
Huh? Ryo-san's not here?

231
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,080
I came here to ask you about this game's strategy.

232
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm sorry. Ryo-chan is currently in training.

233
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,860
Tch.

234
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,820
Ryo-chan is surprisingly popular.

235
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,700
He's been asking for you to repair toys since yesterday,

236
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
and tell him how to play the game.

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,040
Kids come to see him a lot.

238
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
He's a good example of that.

239
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,480
He is.

240
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,140
I wonder what he's been up to lately.

241
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,020
I'll leave the rest to you.

242
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,640
See you later.

243
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,640
See you later.

244
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,680
What happened?

245
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,800
It seems like a big guy has passed away.

246
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,220
He said he was going to get the staff from Tokyo.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,940
Great! Then I'll be the only one today!

248
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,020
Twist, twist, twist without any other people.

249
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,060
But you have to do the training properly.

250
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,140
Twist your hips.

251
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,060
This is the one I need.

252
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,660
Hehehe.

253
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,140
Hehehe.

254
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,300
The Rally-Bong was of great help.

255
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,840
I made a lot of money, and I'm so glad I could get both of them.

256
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,240
This is terrible!

257
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,880
What happened?

258
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,720
I got a notice at 10 today.

259
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
I thought it was tomorrow.

260
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,940
What did you say?

261
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,220
Why didn't you tell me that it was important?

262
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,400
What should I do?

263
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,360
It's my responsibility.

264
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,820
Let me know.

265
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,920
Wait, wait.

266
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't want to be held accountable for the Rally-Bong.

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,160
I'll tell you that I'm the chief.

268
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,960
You?

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Are you sure?

270
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm good at lying.

271
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,500
Leave it to me.

272
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,580
How do I look?

273
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,220
I look like a chief, right?

274
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,420
Yes, if you tell me.

275
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,140
I'll go then.

276
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,400
Well, then.

277
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,200
Let's go.

278
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,060
See ya.

279
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,140
Oh no!

280
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,140
I'll be dead if they find out.

281
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,960
I'm the chief.

282
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,460
Huh?

283
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,480
Huh?

284
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,360
"Heart of Koin " Now

285
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,320
... this way. Yes,

286
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:15,160
sir! Damn it!

287
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,100
It's burnt to the ground!

288
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:34,580
♪ Yaren, Soren, Kita, Senju, Ayase, Kameari, Kanemachi, Matsudo, Ryogoku, Asakusa, Akihabara ♪

289
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,720
That's all.

290
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,740
Eh?

291
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,740
Your majesty!

292
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,340
Oh no! They found us!

293
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,260
I'm impressed. We don't even know your religion.

294
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,180
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,920
Eh?

296
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,600
Thank you for your hard work!

297
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,640
It's nothing.

298
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,740
Then, Amen.

299
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,520
I'll take this.

300
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:07,540
I did it.

301
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,580
The books are all in kanji, so they can't be useful for amateurs.

302
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,460
By the way, how much did you pay for this?

303
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,280
Wow!

304
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,260
Hoshido.

305
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,540
Hoshido.

306
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,260
I didn't know you could get this much for a book.

307
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,660
Welcome back. How was it?

308
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,960
It was perfect.

309
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
I'm glad you came today.

310
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
That's good.

311
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,640
Let's get going.

312
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,980
Order 10 servings of sashimi and 10 servings of meat for sukiyaki.

313
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,640
It's a party until the masters leave.

314
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,200
But, Daikin...

315
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,080
Idiot!

316
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,260
You can't think of such a stupid thing as becoming a monk.

317
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,360
I can't.

318
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,620
I can't.

319
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,280
You can't be a monk.

320
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,780
Order a 2-kilo bottle of beer for the bar.

321
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,240
Thank you, sir.

322
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,640
Thank you, sir.

323
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:05,940
Cheers!

324
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,000
Cheers!

325
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,340
Cheers!

326
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,500
Cheers!

327
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,440
Cheers!

328
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,060
Cheers!

329
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,260
I'm turning it even more than usual.

330
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,220
That's great!

331
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,920
Jinmen-san, you're the best!

332
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,220
Hahaha...

333
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,500
You're on the phone.

334
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,640
I see.

335
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
Red Snake, come on!

336
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,140
Here, kiss of fire!

337
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, you! Why aren't you coming out?

338
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,940
There's no way you can do it!

339
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
Jinmen-san is the best!

340
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,580
Hey, now you do something.

341
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,160
What about me?

342
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,300
That's right.

343
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,300
If you can't do even one of the secret arts, you can't become a great monk.

344
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,400
Oh, no!

345
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,540
What's wrong?

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,740
Jinmen-san, the master just...

347
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,760
Call him Jinmen-masho.

348
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,840
Ah, Jinmen-masho...

349
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,520
I got a call from his younger brother.

350
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,040
He said he wouldn't go to the temple he was asked to go to, so I thought he'd go instead.

351
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,440
All right.

352
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,200
If I go, answer me.

353
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,460
Yes.

354
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,560
Jinmen-masho, is that really okay?

355
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Leave it to me!

356
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,600
If you refuse the temple, you'll be punished.

357
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,380
You can't go against the Buddha's path.

358
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,380
I-I see.

359
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,300
Everything is part of the training.

360
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
You can follow me.

361
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,580
Yahoo!

362
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,580
How much are you going to pay this time?

363
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,820
Wait for me!

364
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,180
Wait for me!

365
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,680
I-I found it!

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
It's here, Jinmen-masho!

367
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,360
Hmm.

368
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,400
Hmm.

369
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,040
Huh?

370
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,940
Why is the chief here?

371
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,280
Oh, Master, I've been waiting.

372
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,640
Oh, no.

373
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,180
Isn't this the chief's brother's house?

374
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,940
Sorry for the trouble.

376
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,920
No, actually, I have to go.

377
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,000
Hey!

378
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,240
Listen, hey!

379
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,460
It's my brother.

380
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,620
Hello.

381
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:04,720
Hello.

382
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,220
This is the chief who came with us this time.

383
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,900
Please, let me in.

384
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,160
Oh, this way.

385
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,640
This way.

386
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,520
Huh?

387
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,720
Yamada-todi.

388
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,080
What's wrong?

389
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,840
You're a baby.

390
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,020
Come on.

391
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,520
What's wrong?

392
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,480
You've prepared a lot of food.

393
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,080
I don't think I can escape with this.

394
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,020
Oh!

395
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:32,700
Huh?

396
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,500
What's wrong?

397
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,220
I was in a hurry, so I took the bag with the

398
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,140
headband and the party goods.

399
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,160
What?

400
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,920
Did you make a mistake?

401
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
But I can't go back.

402
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,760
I have to get rid of it somehow.

403
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,920
Yes.

404
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,280
Yes.

405
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,540
Yes.

406
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,320
Yes.

407
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,600
Yes.

408
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,300
Yes.

409
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,640
Yes.

410
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:58,720
Yes.

411
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:58,920
Yes.

412
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,120
Yes.

413
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,680
Yes.

414
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,440
Yes.

415
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:05,800
What's wrong with him?

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,900
Don't come with them.

417
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,860
What?

418
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,980
They're like us.

419
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,620
What?

420
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,760
Don't be silent!

421
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,700
They're like you.

422
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,680
Don't touch me.

423
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:19,700
Don't touch me.

424
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,160
Don't touch me.

425
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,920
How could I allow you, my brother?

426
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,420
You say that I am your brother who has the right to eat?

427
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,780
How can I be your brother?

428
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:23,940
Then I'll never overlook.

429
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,820
But you have a death sentence.

430
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,540
I'm sorry.

431
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,740
That's all.

432
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,120
That's how it works, huh?

433
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,540
Yeah, that's one big idiot at Ryotsu.

434
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,660
Well anyway, it's time to hang up now.

435
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,240
Before we get to current business, I would really like to ask someone for a favor, but...

436
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,640
What?

437
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,760
When you give your blessing, you have to turn three times and cry.

438
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,040
What for?

439
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,380
I told you the frequency is different, right?

440
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,600
Do it. You'll get a punishment.

441
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
I won't do as you say.

442
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,980
But, brother...

443
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,440
Just go!

444
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,440
Here we go.

445
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,880
No...

446
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,000
James!

447
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,500
James!

448
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:23,900
What?

449
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,580
Open your mouth wide and run while you drool!

450
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,380
Do you understand?

451
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,040
No...

452
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,760
You can't go any further!

453
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,540
It hurts, doesn't it?

454
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,880
It doesn't hurt if you just take a deep breath.

455
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,620
It doesn't hurt if you just stop and hit me.

456
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,500
What?

457
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,760
Oh, I remember something.

458
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,660
You said you hit me without showing your cute face.

459
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,540
If you don't confess honestly, everyone here will get a punishment.

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,300
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,700
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,120
You remember something?

463
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,120
What's wrong, Daijiro?

464
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,320
Ah, yes.

465
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,740
How scary!

466
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,520
Because of him, everyone will get a punishment.

467
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,420
Daijiro, I'm sorry.

468
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,820
I'm sorry for confessing in front of a great prince from Shotenji.

469
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,740
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,160
Shotenji...

471
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,380
Excuse me.

472
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,060
Excuse me.

473
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,080
Could you take off your glasses?

474
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,760
What are you talking about?

475
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,460
This is the characteristic of my sect.

476
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,980
I can't do it.

477
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,060
Yes, yes.

478
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,100
Can't you hear me?

479
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,320
I'll beat you up!

480
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,760
Hmm...

481
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,600
Hey, Daijiro!

482
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,640
Ryotsu!

483
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,860
There's 10,000 yen there!

484
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,100
What?

485
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,340
Where is it?

486
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,780
Where?

487
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,740
G-g-g-g...

488
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,580
Hmm...

489
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,160
Hmm...

490
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,500
Hmm...

491
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,780
Hmm...

492
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,340
What's wrong with you?

493
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,320
I knew it.

494
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,660
Ryotsu is the one who's talking nonsense!

495
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
No, it's just a misunderstanding...

496
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,080
Ryotsu!

497
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,960
I'm going to get you!

498
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,640
Stop!

499
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,180
Why are you doing this to me?

500
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,880
Somebody help me!

501
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,160
Hey, hey!

502
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,820
What's wrong?

503
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,580
What's wrong?

504
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,120
What's wrong?

505
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,700
What's wrong?

506
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,400
What's wrong?

507
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,760
What's wrong?

508
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,720
What's wrong?

509
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,080
What's wrong?

510
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,180
What's wrong?

511
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,720
What's wrong?

512
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,060
What's wrong?

513
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,200
What's wrong?

514
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,400
What's wrong?

515
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,120
Stop it!

516
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,360
What's wrong?

517
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,400
It's fine, you get the money!

518
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,400
Stop it!

519
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,900
What's wrong?

520
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,360
Hey, stop it!

521
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,660
Hey, shut up!

522
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,420
Get out of here!

523
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,580
You get a bottle of alcohol on your hands!

524
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,380
Can't you let your brain relax?

525
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,160
What's wrong?

526
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,200
Created by the Ino visit,

527
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,920
Created by the Ino visit,

528
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,140
Created by the Ino visit,

529
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,180
Created by the Ino visit,

530
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,460
And the lion will become a cat again.

531
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,300
I don't have enough training.

532
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,420
Mr. Young Man.

533
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,080
S-s-s-save me!

534
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,260
7 hours of work is too much!

535
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm going to die!

536
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,080
You, old man, leave the new My Home to me.

537
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,060
I'll find you a better place than the manager's house!

538
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm a professional buyer after all!
