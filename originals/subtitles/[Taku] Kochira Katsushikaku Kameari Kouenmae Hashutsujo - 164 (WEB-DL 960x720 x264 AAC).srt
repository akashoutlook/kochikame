1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,360
The End

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,900
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,620
Keep your room bright and keep your distance

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone's calling

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,200
After the rain

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,200
You look back

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,100
And walk

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,400
Give your hand to your mom

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,020
The strange feeling I felt

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,840
At that time

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,120
So I walked

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,380
Of the arcade

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:52,540
And saw

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,100
Who was it?

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,020
Who was it?

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,300
Everyone was a child once

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,820
But everyone forgot

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,200
A politician with a big face

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt in her eyes

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,320
Turn around

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,020
That corner

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,800
You can see everyone

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,080
There's a wall there

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,520
There's a wall there

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,800
There's a wall there

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Come on, everyone

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,440
To our town

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you!

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,300
Friendship Wings

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,460
It's not fair!

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,460
J.A.T.

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,820
This is the union business

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,570
Thank you for your service

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,040
Thank you for your service

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,400
recyclable

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,860
Coast ME

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,800
Rent

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,100
Rent

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,880
As well as

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,200
With various

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,440
E-sports

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,900
I'm going home for my friend's wedding.

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,440
I didn't know that.

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,440
We will arrive at Haneda Airport soon.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,580
Captain, the wheels are not working.

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,160
What?

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,300
One more time.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
No, they're not working.

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
Stop landing. Increase the altitude.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,320
What? It started to rise again.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,000
What happened?

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,020
What? It doesn't fly at all.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,660
It's strange. I made it according to the design.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,020
The main wing is in bad position.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,300
Ryo-san.

56
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,020
Let me see.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,780
Look, the center of gravity is too forward.

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,160
What?

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,340
The angle of the wings doesn't change.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,480
What? Is that so?

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,720
The position of the wings is important for airplanes.

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,660
The wings are the life of the airplane.

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,440
Do you know why airplanes fly?

64
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,600
I don't know.

65
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,780
They fly because they fly.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,180
By changing the angle of the wings to the energy of the wind,

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,040
the aircraft becomes powerful and powerful.

68
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,000
Ryo-san, you're amazing.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,600
You know everything.

70
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,300
That's the acceptance of a best friend in elementary school.

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,980
I see.

72
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,860
But it's amazing that a best friend knows that in elementary school.

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,740
Yes.

74
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,620
That's Takashi.

75
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,540
He said he wanted to be a pilot in the future.

76
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,860
He liked airplanes so much.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,160
I see.

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,000
When I was the same age as you,

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,680
the airplane contest hosted by the model company was held every month.

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,200
I participated in it often.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,120
Do you know Bentendo Island,

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,220
in the middle of Ueno's Shinobazu Lake?

83
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,620
Yes.

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,980
The contest was a competition to fly an airplane to Bentendo Island,

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,500
but it was a tough one because if you failed on the way,

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
you would fall into the lake.

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,220
Go, Stargo!

88
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:36,880
Go!

89
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,820
Go!

90
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,120
Number 21 failed.

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,580
Damn it!

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,800
Next is number 22.

93
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,760
All right.

94
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,360
Kankichi, do your best for us.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,780
I'm counting on you.

96
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,300
Leave it to me.

97
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,000
Good direction.

98
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,880
Good wind direction.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,700
Go, Hindenburg!

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,500
Ouch!

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
Number 22 failed.

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,140
What?

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,920
You can't even reach the lake.

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
That's strange.

105
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,760
What's wrong with it?

106
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,820
Isn't it all?

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,340
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,840
It seems that everyone failed.

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,900
It's impossible to fly to Bentendo Island.

110
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,220
Wow!

111
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,620
Wow!

112
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,630
Wow!

113
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,860
Wow!

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,580
Wow!

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Wow!

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,220
Wow!

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,620
Wow!

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:35,740
Wow!

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,040
Wow!

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,580
Wow!

121
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,180
And I'm running out of electricity.

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,900
Wowâ€¦

123
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,500
Whose's it?

124
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,040
Adults make it, right?

125
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,280
That's number 24 from Lindbergh.

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,000
Number 24?

127
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,880
Yes.

128
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,760
Huh?

129
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,540
I can't believe it.

130
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,940
It's like a child like us.

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,040
The winner is Takashi Asahina of Lindbergh.

132
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,500
The airplane is amazing.

133
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,520
Incredible.

134
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,220
Hey,

135
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,020
if you like,

136
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,520
If you like, can you teach me how to make it?

137
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,580
Please!

138
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,480
Sure.

139
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,360
Yay!

140
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,860
For a model airplane, the wings are important.

141
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,660
Wings are the life of an airplane.

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,220
Oh...

143
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
Do you know why an airplane flies?

144
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,720
No...

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,700
Maybe it flies because it flies.

146
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,680
By changing the angle of the wings to the energy of the wind,

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,880
the aircraft will have the strength and the power to fly.

148
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,300
Power?

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,360
Power?

150
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,600
It's hard to say.

151
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,160
Airflow is a property that lowers the air pressure when the speed of the current increases.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,740
The reason why you put paper on the wings is to increase the pressure.

153
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,720
Do you understand?

154
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes, I do.

155
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,780
I don't understand.

156
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,980
In other words...

157
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,020
I brought my first good friend, Kankichi.

158
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,540
You're stupid.

159
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,420
Don't say that.

160
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,920
I could have given you a snack.

161
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,600
Thank you, auntie.

162
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,900
Oh, auntie.

163
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you.

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,260
Oh, my.

165
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm not your auntie.

166
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,800
Oh, my.

167
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,820
Don't laugh like that.

168
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,760
It's disgusting.

169
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,420
Thank you.

170
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,480
Take it easy.

171
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,240
Thank you.

172
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,520
You're a good kid.

173
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,620
You're a smart kid.

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,180
Oh, my.

175
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,240
What are you talking about?

176
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,860
You're stupid.

177
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,900
Takashi, you're in the same elementary school as us,

178
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,820
but you know difficult things very well.

179
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,080
My dream is to become a pilot.

180
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,080
A pilot?

181
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,340
That's cool.

182
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,080
It'll be fun.

183
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,460
It'll be fun.

184
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:41,780
Oh?

185
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,200
Â¡Oh, man!

186
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,860
What's that sparkling thing?

187
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,540
Â¿What can it be?

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,180
Isn't it a Ramen?

189
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,500
Takashi?

190
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,680
Do you not know what a Ramen is?

191
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,720
Ramen?

192
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,080
Then I'll teach you how to do it.

193
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,060
Put the Ramen on you and walk.

194
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,340
You'll get the back-igaed Ramen.

195
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,720
Hey, it sounds amazing.

196
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,680
Hey, it sounds amazing.

197
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,360
It'll take three years.

198
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,280
You're so powerful.

199
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,660
And among the menkoro, this silver photo is called "silver face" and it's expensive.

200
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,380
Kankichi has 200 silver faces.

201
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,400
It's the man's medal.

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,420
Kankichi, you're good.

203
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,020
Well, in Asakusa, Kankichi is the strongest.

204
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,880
I've been doing it for 10 hours and I've even removed the bones on my shoulders.

205
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,500
You're noisy.

206
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,260
It's a very difficult game.

207
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,460
Can you teach me?

208
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,340
Sure.

209
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,780
Huh? I can't do it.

210
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,740
You have to step on the axis.

211
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,520
Like this?

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,600
You have to be strong.

213
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,360
For example, when you remember being scolded, you say, "Daddy, you're an idiot!"

214
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,000
Ouch!

215
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,820
What did you say?

216
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,520
Ouch!

217
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,700
It's dangerous to say it out loud.

218
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,560
So you have to shout it out in your mind and hit the menkoro.

219
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,780
I got it.

220
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,580
Daddy's...

221
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,680
Idiot!

222
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,900
I did it!

223
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,180
I did it, Kankichi!

224
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,020
Good job, Takashi!

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Since then, we've been in different schools, but Takashi and I met every day and he opened the menkoro and the plane for us.

226
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,200
I can't do it again.

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,580
All right! I got it!

228
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,980
Ouch!

229
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,600
Ouch!

230
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,580
All right, your turn, Takashi.

231
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,440
I knew I can't play the real game!

232
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,060
I don't want to get your menkoro anymore...

233
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't worry about it.

234
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,660
Takashi, don't give up on your menko winning.

235
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,000
Remember! You'll definitely win if you # sigma # win!

236
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,200
I got it, Kankichi!

237
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,580
Remember! You'll definitely win if you # Tamara # win!

238
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:07,780
We can win!

239
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,560
Alright!

240
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,560
BABALO!

241
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,460
You idiot!

242
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,960
We did it!

243
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,340
We did it!

244
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,040
We did it!

245
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,700
Hey!

246
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,000
Come to my house next time.

247
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,700
It's the first night market near the lighthouse.

248
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,920
Eh?

249
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,100
Can I go?

250
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,140
Yeah.

251
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,080
Alright!

252
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,780
Let's go!

253
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah!

254
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,540
Oh!

255
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:38,960
Here!

256
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,080
Look!

257
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,640
It's a candy shop.

258
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,200
It's not the house of the minister.

259
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,000
Welcome!

260
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,660
Ah...

261
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,420
Hello!

262
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,920
Please come in.

263
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,840
Let's go to my room.

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,760
Oh,

265
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,720
Thank you for the tea.

266
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,720
Thank you for the tea.

267
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,680
We'll bring tea later.

268
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,620
Okay.

269
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,480
It's beautiful.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,480
It's elegant.

271
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,200
It's different from my mother.

272
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,420
What's wrong?

273
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:02,980
Come on.

274
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,780
Yeah.

275
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,780
Wow!

276
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,180
It's amazing.

277
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,580
Takashi's room is full of airplanes.

278
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,880
My dad is a pilot.

279
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,040
Eh?

280
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,740
A pilot?

281
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,140
That's why he's famous as a pilot.

282
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,000
That's amazing.

283
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,220
Here.

284
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,100
Here's your tea.

285
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,020
Oh, sorry.

286
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,600
Hey, I want coffee.

287
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,960
How about sugar?

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,900
Yes.

289
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,720
It's my first time to drink coffee.

290
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,940
I'll have 10 cups.

291
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
We'll have 10 cups, too.

292
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,780
10 cups?

293
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,740
10 cups?

294
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,460
Dad,

295
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,820
they're Asakusa's friends.

296
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,840
They talked about us before.

297
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,560
it's you guys.

298
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,400
We're here.

299
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,980
Dad,

300
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,120
are you leaving already?

301
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,960
Yeah.

302
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,420
This flight to Europe will be longer.

303
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,960
Cool.

304
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,920
It's Europe.

305
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,260
Europe?

306
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,220
Where is Europe?

307
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,440
I know it's Harappa.

308
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,700
I know it's Harappa.

309
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:01,760
I know it's Harappa.

310
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,240
Have a good time.

311
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,180
Thank you.

312
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,540
Have a good time.

313
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,140
Have a good time.

314
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,240
Go.

315
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,200
Dad,

316
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,440
Dad,

317
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,520
previously on TV,

318
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,500
you said you knew everyome.

319
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:09,760
Just like dad.

320
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,860
Almost like a home drama in the United States.

321
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,800
Did something happen?

322
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,140
No.

323
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,820
It's the first time I've seen my dad

324
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,460
tie up his tie to go to work.

325
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,260
My father,

326
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,660
no,

327
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,680
he looks like a dod blade.

328
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,000
Mine, too.

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,140
Mine is the clay one.

330
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,340
Your place is

331
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,080
just a far away place in Asakusa.

332
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,260
It's so nice.

333
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,000
Not at all.

334
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,100
It's just old and old.

335
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
All three of us are drinking.

336
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,320
That's all we do when we're on leave.

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,500
Well, then, take your time.

338
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,480
Thank you.

339
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,140
Takashi's so nice.

340
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,940
He has such a beautiful mother and a cool father.

341
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,300
I envy him.

342
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,740
I envy Kanchi and the others.

343
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:58,960
I envy the two of them.

344
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,700
Huh?

345
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, right. Let's play some games.

346
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,140
Wow, there's a lot of games.

347
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,900
Which one should we play?

348
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,800
What about the time-lapse train game?

349
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,080
What's so funny about that?

350
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,900
Chinkichi is a railroad maniac.

351
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,120
Hey, let's play just once. It's fun.

352
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,680
You play it alone.

353
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,420
What? You want me to wear a tie?

354
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,700
Do you have a fever?

355
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,860
No.

356
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,760
My father wants me to wear a tie like Takashi.

357
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,660
Can you cook with a tie?

358
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,120
You idiot!

359
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,360
Hey, wait.

360
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,520
Hey, Kanchi. I brought you some coffee.

361
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,540
As expected! This is American style.

362
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,960
Here.

363
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,760
Huh?

364
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,740
Mom, don't drink it.

365
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,060
Don't drink it.

366
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,620
Drink it in a cup with a handle.

367
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,540
I don't have anything like that.

368
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,800
It's the same as anything if you get hungry.

369
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,180
Hmm.

370
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,180
No.

371
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,820
This father is so far from America.

372
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,520
What?

373
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,500
You want me to take a pilot's license now?

374
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,640
Don't you dare lie down!

375
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,540
Hey, you!

376
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,580
What are you thinking?

377
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,860
If you have time to think about that,

378
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,820
learn how to make a chowchin.

379
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,680
You won't make it in time for the order.

380
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,800
Damn it!

381
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,700
What?

382
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,260
What?

383
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,820
The next person is him?

384
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,560
It's cooler if you go out by car.

385
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,620
You idiot!

386
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,020
Ouch!

387
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,580
Where do you get such money?

388
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,560
You idiot!

389
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,620
I can't do it either.

390
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,460
My father can't talk either.

391
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,960
All three of them are stubborn fathers.

392
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,260
I really envy Takashi.

393
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,800
A car that's expensive for a nice house.

394
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,240
A cool dad who's as beautiful as a beautiful woman.

395
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,080
Isn't that great?

396
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,140
Not at all.

397
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,380
My dad is not at home at work.

398
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,900
I envy Kanchi and his parents who are always with him.

399
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,840
You're so noisy.

400
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,160
Yeah.

401
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,260
My parents...

402
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,400
They don't seem to get along very well.

403
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,760
No way!

404
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,600
My parents...

405
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,940
They fight a lot recently.

406
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,100
I don't care if they don't live in a good house.

407
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,600
I don't care if they don't have a car that's expensive.

408
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,080
I don't care if they don't have a car that's expensive.

409
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,820
I just want my mom and dad to get along.

410
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,780
Don't worry.

411
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,320
My mom and dad are fighting every day.

412
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,000
My mom and dad?

413
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,820
My mom too.

414
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,540
It's okay.

415
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Takashi's parents will get along soon.

416
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,140
I guess.

417
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,920
They're adults.

418
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,080
Yeah.

419
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
It's okay.

420
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,440
It's okay.

421
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,640
It's okay.

422
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,820
It's okay.

423
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,620
Yeah.

424
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,320
It's much better now.

425
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,420
It's much better now.

426
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,580
Really?

427
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,400
Takashi praised me.

428
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,080
Great!

429
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,520
Okay.

430
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
I'll give you the flight this month.

431
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,580
You'll fall into the pond.

432
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,580
What?

433
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,460
But I think it's going to be a good flight.

434
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,780
Okay.

435
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
I'll fly you to the movie theater next week.

436
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,000
Stop it, Kanchi.

437
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,700
Next week?

438
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm looking forward to it.

439
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,560
You don't like being with your family that much?

440
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Stop it.

441
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,140
You'll always have to do your job.

442
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,540
Which is more important?

443
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:25,960
Your family or your job?

444
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,200
Even if you have to fly, you'll still be the pilot's wife.

445
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,380
Or should I say your wife?

446
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,900
You should marry the plane.

447
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,620
Shut up.

448
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,600
You're so late.

449
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,440
The movie's about to start.

450
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,100
Hey.

451
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,540
You should've thrown it before we left.

452
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:49,940
It's starting.

453
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,860
Yeah.

454
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,980
Let's wait inside.

455
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,460
Takashi finally got here.

456
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,720
Did he go to school?

457
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,380
Let's give him the pamphlets.

458
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,080
Takashi was looking forward to the movie.

459
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,200
Huh?

460
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,740
Takashi's house is...

461
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,940
It's pitch black.

462
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,200
That's strange.

463
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,980
It's not showing at all.

464
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,160
There's no car either.

465
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,440
Are you the Kankichi brothers?

466
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
Yeah, but...

467
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,300
The kids of Asahina-san are holding this thing.

468
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,260
Oh! Takashi's plane!

469
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,540
Thank you!

470
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,580
Oh! That letter is here.

471
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,900
Uncle, where's Takashi and the gang?

472
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,080
They left.

473
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,020
Their parents got divorced.

474
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,920
What? Divorced?

475
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,240
But they left with their mother now.

476
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,600
They'll probably go back home.

477
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,280
No way.

478
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,920
Why are they keeping it from us?

479
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,400
Kankichi, Tonpei, Chinkichi, please forgive me for leaving you in silence.

480
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,620
The two months I spent with you were so much fun.

481
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,520
Ueno 22:20, Aomori 20th!

482
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
Maybe it's this train!

483
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,700
22:00?

484
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
We have 5 minutes left!

485
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,360
No! It will take 10 minutes from here to Ueno Station! We won't make it!

486
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,600
No! We can still make it!

487
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,240
What?

488
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,080
We can't make it!

489
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,960
The 22:20 Aomori special train will depart soon.

490
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,360
Please get in and wait for us.

491
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,660
Kankichi, we can't make it! We won't make it!

492
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,760
But the direction is different!

493
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,940
I'm going to go home! Wait for me!

494
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,620
Kankichi! What are you thinking about?

495
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,900
It's okay if I'm not here, Takashi.

496
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,200
Okay, Mama.

497
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,700
It just started.

498
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,980
We can't make it!

499
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,760
Hey!

500
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,900
What are you doing? The train is...

501
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,700
Hey!

502
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,460
We can't make it! We won't make it!

503
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,140
Besides, where are we going?

504
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,500
Ueno station is over there!

505
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,120
Just follow me!

506
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,720
I was so happy!

507
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,900
Why?

508
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,340
Why did we get divorced?

509
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,060
Kankichi!

510
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,060
I don't know!

511
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,500
The world of adults!

512
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,480
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

513
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,520
Goodbye.

514
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,320
The train will depart.

515
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,300
I understand. It's Nippori.

516
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,500
The train might pass through here.

517
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
What time is it now?

518
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,560
10:05 a.m.

519
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,780
That's it! That train!

520
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,080
Help me!

521
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,800
It's silver!

522
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,480
Did they go to pick this up?

523
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,880
What should we do with this?

524
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,360
Takashi, you gave me the most important plane.

525
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,080
You gave me a plane. Now it's my turn!

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,940
Throw it at the train!

527
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,560
Take my treasure!

528
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,220
What? Snow?

529
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,980
A shining god is flying!

530
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,160
No way!

531
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,320
Kankichi and the others!

532
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,420
Let's fly the plane together again!

533
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,860
Let's make it to the end!

534
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,060
You were on board, Takahashi.

535
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,700
I was.

536
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm glad to see you.

537
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,680
The End

538
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,380
Amazing!

539
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,620
Thank you, Ryo!

540
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,320
Ryo, did Takahashi become a pilot?

541
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,160
I don't know.

542
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,660
But I believe that he will.

543
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,840
He will realize his dream and fly the world.

544
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,120
Ryo, this is bad!

545
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,220
Reiko and Nakagawa are on the plane!

546
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,420
Everyone, the plane is about to land.

547
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,660
Please follow the instructions of the crew.

548
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
Everyone, please calm down!

549
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
There is no point in making a fuss here.

550
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,220
Let's believe in the captain here!

551
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,700
Let's go!

552
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,700
Yes, sir!

553
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,480
Don't give up!

554
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,060
If you think you can hide it, you will definitely win!

555
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,420
Kankichi, I won't give up!

556
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,220
Take this!

557
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:33,420
Let's go for a little opppression!

558
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,180
Let's go, Takahashi!

559
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,640
Still, we'll take it easy here.

560
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,040
Hey.

561
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,780
Are you before us?

562
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:39,860
Whoa!

563
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,400
How precious!

564
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,600
We are one and only.

565
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,300
Let's go!

566
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,320
So, where does this plane go?

567
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,000
What?

568
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,060
Captain, we did it! We did it!

569
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,880
Reiko!

570
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,400
Reiko!

571
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,740
Nakagawa!

572
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,280
Hey!

573
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,200
Ryo!

574
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,940
Senpai! Terai!

575
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,240
You're safe!

576
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,740
Thanks to you, we were saved.

577
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,680
That's great.

578
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,440
It's all thanks to Captain's calm control.

579
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,600
It's Captain!

580
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,200
Kankichi!

581
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,920
T-Takashi!

582
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,260
Let's go, Kankichi.

583
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,700
Get off the bus!

584
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,220
Hey!

585
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,220
Go!

586
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,280
Me!

587
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,500
If you don't make it, it's too dangerous!

588
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,140
Good!

589
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,840
Move it!

590
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,400
It's dangerous!

591
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,060
I'm not scared with you!

592
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,580
You're my best friend from the first episode!

593
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,840
Keeper, keeper, it's time to save the world.

594
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,940
I'm sorry I'm your darling.

595
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,800
Where are you going?

596
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,380
Come on!

597
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,780
Please, stop.

598
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,040
Razor!

599
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,400
â™ª It's so smooth and smooth â™ª

600
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,680
â™ª Even the frustration that's been left behind â™ª

601
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,440
â™ª Let's get rid of it with "Iraniran" â™ª

602
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,460
â™ª Every day is no problem â™ª

603
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,900
â™ª If you go through the hot shower â™ª

604
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,240
â™ª Every day is no problem â™ª

605
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,100
â™ª Get well with a safe pillow â™ª

606
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,700
â™ª Get well with a safe pillow â™ª

607
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,680
â™ª Every day is no problem â™ª

608
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,100
â™ª I love myself like this â™ª

609
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,520
â™ª Every day is no problem â™ª

610
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,260
â™ª My heart is beating â™ª

611
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,120
â™ª Every Monday â™ª

612
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,540
Oh, "Denyoku Plus"! Long time no see!

613
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm going to the amusement park with my father.

614
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,860
I thought he was your father, so I thought he was a good guy.

615
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,360
He's a very decent guy.

616
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,680
No, he's not!

617
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,980
Hey, you should do something about this father!

618
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,460
Next time on "The Hyper President's Family Service"!

619
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,280
Thank you for watching!

620
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,980
â™ª There's a turtle over there â™ª

621
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,720
â™ª There's definitely a turtle over there â™ª

622
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,280
â™ª Everyone, come to our town â™ª
