1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,380
"The End"

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,920
When you watch TV

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,740
Make the room brighter and try to look away

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:25,300
A place where it rains like someone is calling

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,380
A place where it rains like someone is calling

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,400
I walked while looking back

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,880
I held my mother's hand

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,120
I felt a strange feeling at that time

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,220
So I tried to walk on the black side of the Ake-dogai Tile

10
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,360
Everyone was a child once

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,700
But everyone forgets

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,260
A politician with a great face

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,800
And a blue aunt above his eyes

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,180
Turn around and see that corner

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,860
You can meet everyone

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,380
There is a wall there

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,800
There is a turtle there

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,540
Everyone come to our town

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,620
Thank you!

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,740
"The Journey of the Rice and the Tenderloin"

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,980
P-please...

22
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,340
Someone help me...

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,540
Reiko, please...

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,020
Please, something to eat...

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,380
Something to eat...

26
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,140
No!

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,600
Reiko...

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,060
I'll eat it with you

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,060
This is for Ryo-chan

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,660
Reiko, you mean...

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,800
Something to eat...

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,660
No matter what you say, it's not good

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,460
Nakagawa-kun...

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,560
Stop it, senpai!

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,860
Don't come any further!

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,660
Nakagawa, 100 yen, 50 yen...

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,440
30 yen is enough...

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,620
I beg you...

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,260
Senpai, I'm sorry but...

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,360
I can't lend you money

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,560
You know, right?

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,460
This is a director's order

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,320
Shut up, I don't understand

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,620
What are you saying, Nakagawa?

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,200
Normally, if you see a painful sight, you'll be stubborn

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,520
But Ryo-chan, every month...

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,700
Even if you go to the front of the gashi, you still won't be stubborn

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,820
Since long ago, the edokko has been decided that it does not have the money to spend the night

49
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,620
Then, like edokko

50
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,900
You are proud of it and you are very angry

51
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,900
Director!

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,660
You don't think about the future

53
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,440
You buy more and more what you want with your salary

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,300
You don't have any food expenses

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,720
Who will agree to that?

56
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,540
The big hearted director will...

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,720
Who will?

58
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,760
If you want to eat white rice every day

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
You can use your salary as planned

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,980
How many times do I have to tell you?

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,680
Big hearted director...

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,980
Big hearted director...

63
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,440
You should put that feeling into your stomach

64
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,460
Got it?

65
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,900
If you understand, you will not waste it again

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,980
Say it out loud!

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,980
I won't waste it

68
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,460
You shouldn't forget those words

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,440
In order not to give money to Ryo-chan

70
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,000
There is nothing you can't understand even if you say it with your mouth

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,100
There is nothing to be learned by body

72
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,340
Yes

73
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,540
Ryo-chan

74
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,180
Ryo-chan

75
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,900
Wake up, Ryo-chan

76
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,800
Let's deliver the food

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
Ryo-chan

78
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,760
Please give me the signature of the receipt

79
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,700
Thank you

80
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,960
It's rice!

81
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,920
Yahoo!

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,180
It's rice! It's rice! I'm so happy!

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,280
You did a great job with everything

84
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,740
What is this rice?

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,880
I don't know, but it's for me

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,360
I made it myself

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,560
It's mine!

88
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,640
Look, senior

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,740
You've applied for the 10th anniversary quiz of the Ekimai supermarket

90
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,580
The 10th anniversary quiz of the Ekimai supermarket

91
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,460
You've applied for the 10th anniversary quiz of the Ekimai supermarket

92
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,400
Ah, the prize from that time!

93
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,300
Oh my god!

94
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,880
Heaven didn't let me go!

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,980
Now it's smooth without a mess

96
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,000
That's great, senior

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
What a lucky person

98
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,740
This rice is mine

99
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,980
It's not just a piece of cake if you touch it

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,660
That's right

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey, master!

102
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,220
I've ordered it!

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
I've brought your rice cooker

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
Ok, here it comes

105
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,620
What's that?

106
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,120
No, it's from Niconico Ryo's kitchen

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,260
I just took it from there

108
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,960
Ryo-chan, I'll do it

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
Don't be a coward!

110
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,640
You seem to be feeling better.

111
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,420
You should stay away for a while.

112
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,220
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

113
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,020
It's like a beast.

114
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,040
If you eat so fast, your stomach will not accept it.

115
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,380
Here, look.

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,880
Shall we bring the washing machine?

117
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,940
Wow!

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,700
I ate all 15 of them.

119
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,740
Here we go.

120
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,540
You're going to eat again?

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,240
Let's eat!

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,240
I can't get enough of white rice.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,540
I guess he's getting bored.

124
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,520
What?

125
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,980
What's that?

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,400
You're going to cook with that?

127
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,680
What a sad dish.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480
I feel thelling of life for you.

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,460
BREAK!

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,060
You bourgeoisies...

131
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,380
You shouldn't be aware of...

132
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,980
But I can't understand the taste of this seasoned rice

133
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,540
This is fried rice seasoned with only salt and pepper

134
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,140
Since it is seasoned with only salt and pepper, the taste of the rice itself is not killed

135
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,520
The outside is crispy and the inside is fluffy

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
This frying method is successful in bringing out the texture of the rice to the maximum

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,660
And the omurice-like rice seasoned with only ketchup

138
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,680
The moist ketchup is entwined with the rice

139
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,280
The ketchup wraps the taste of the rice well

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,360
And brings out the taste of the rice

141
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,100
And the rice sushi that is served with fresh white rice

142
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,880
The original taste of the rice and the rice are not quarreled

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,300
They are mixed well on the tongue

144
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,440
And bring out the exquisite harmony

145
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,280
Let's eat

146
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,600
Delicious

147
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,240
This is delicious, too

148
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,020
Delicious

149
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,040
Too delicious

150
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,740
Very delicious

151
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,940
Super delicious

152
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,320
You guys have been observing me since a while ago

153
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,060
You guys want to eat this

154
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,580
You have been so cold a while ago

155
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
Who will share it with you?

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,060
Well, I am not a demon

157
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,000
I have two more people

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
Lord Ryochi

159
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,340
I am very sorry for what happened just now

160
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,180
I will eat it if you forgive me

161
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Why do I have to apologize?

162
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,660
That's right, you have to apologize

163
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,000
Ah, is that so?

164
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,720
Well

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Delicious

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
It's delicious!

167
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,500
Lord Gyoji, I'm terribly sorry for what happened earlier.

168
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
The world of rice is...

169
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,580
...unceasingly wide!

170
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,500
Thank you for waiting.

171
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,440
Here, inside there is fried rice.

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,560
Fried rice without any ingredients, with rice!

173
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,420
This is truly the ultimate dish.

174
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,180
And for Reiko, it's healthy, spicy rice!

175
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,340
Could this be...

176
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,780
...rice with spicy rice?

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,160
Yes, put it on rice.

178
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,780
This is truly the ultimate dish.

179
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,320
And for Honda, it's a special, Zargome.

180
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,080
Zargome?

181
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,620
It's smooth like Zaru-soba.

182
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,280
Smooth?

183
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,020
I'll eat it!

184
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,400
This is the ultimate dish!

185
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,460
This is the ultimate dish!

186
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,720
How is it?

187
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,960
I can't say anything about it.

188
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
It's just not like rice.

189
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,440
It's hard to eat this, Seppai.

190
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,400
Eat without leaving any leftovers.

191
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,300
Don't forget to take good care of the rice.

192
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,440
Lord Gyoji!

193
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,980
What?

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,840
Lord Gyoji, I'd like to have your signature.

195
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
This is rice.

196
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Rice again.

197
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,880
This is hard to eat.

198
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,980
What the hell is this?

199
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,860
The Rice Eating Association?

200
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,460
What's that?

201
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,460
Ryo-chan, when did you join such a group?

202
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,240
This is hard to eat.

203
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,240
I see.

204
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,740
I put out a post on a campaign to think of a new name for rice.

205
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,760
The name I thought of, "Rice-chan", has been selected and has been sent as a product.

206
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,180
"Rice-chan"?

207
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,020
Is that your name?

208
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,660
It's so hard to eat!

209
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,940
But, Seppai, what are you going to do with so much rice?

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,080
Hmm...

211
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,780
Damn it.

212
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,380
Damn it.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,780
Oh, Ryo-chan, welcome.

214
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,320
Hey, old lady.

215
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,840
Nice to meet you.

216
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
This is my familiar place.

217
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,160
That's right.

218
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,100
Old lady, as I told you on the phone, I'm going to rent a place.

219
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,820
Oh, you can use it anywhere you want.

220
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,900
I'm free anyway.

221
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,260
Hehe.

222
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,260
Ryo-chan!

223
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,500
This is such a boring place.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,340
I've been looking for a long time.

225
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,260
Oh, I've been waiting.

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,660
But, are you really going to start a business here?

227
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,080
You don't seem to be doing as you like.

228
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,200
Really?

229
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
No worries.

230
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,440
Here you go.

231
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,820
It's a lot of numbers.

232
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,200
What are those numbers?

233
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:11,400
This is the amount of time I needed to spend the whole time in Kameari-cho, which broke the patrol rule.

234
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,740
Really?

235
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,380
I thought that the next time would be useful, so I decided to find a better location instead.

236
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,960
That's what I decided.

237
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,820
Especially around here, it's far from the station,

238
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,680
and there are many factories, but there are very few restaurants.

239
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,360
There are no convenience stores, so if I were to say a business,

240
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,540
it's just a hamburger shop across the street.

241
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,840
Before, when it was noon,

242
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,360
the factory workers would come to buy bread.

243
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,020
A few years ago, I suddenly thought that construction had started across the street...

244
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,280
From now on, we will be rivals, but please take care of us.

245
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,060
-Kyosuke. -Huh?

246
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,460
I'm sorry, but this world is a world of weak meat and strong food.

247
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,320
Since then, I've been very relaxed.

248
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,920
If that's the case, we can also do business without any worries.

249
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,880
How about 30% of what you are getting?

250
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,520
Huh? Is that really okay?

251
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,680
It's a business deal, a business deal.

252
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,380
After all, it's free.

253
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,940
That's right. And I don't know if it will sell.

254
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,760
It will sell. It's obvious that it will sell.

255
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
Yes, it will sell. I'll sell it.

256
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,960
Are you selling this rice ball?

257
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,620
If you eat only hamburgers every day, you'll get bored, right?

258
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,720
And if you're Japanese, you'll miss the rice.

259
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,540
I see.

260
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,160
As expected of Ryo-sama.

261
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,100
It's time.

262
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,860
What's this siren?

263
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,060
It's a sign of a lunch break at the factory.

264
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,620
It's a sign of a lunch break at the factory.

265
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,260
It's a sign of a lunch break at the factory.

266
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,060
Why are there so many customers?

267
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,320
Okay, I can't lose either.

268
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,660
The battle begins.

269
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,380
Welcome. Welcome.

270
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,920
This is Ryo-tsu's real rice ball.

271
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,540
Today, we're going to sell a lot of things.

272
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
Each one is 50 yen.

273
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,180
Sake, tarako, plum, and kelp.

274
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,760
Each one is 50 yen.

275
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,840
Welcome. Welcome.

276
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,260
50 yen is cheap.

277
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
I want plum and tarako.

278
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,500
I want tarako and kelp.

279
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,860
It's 350 yen.

280
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,540
Three kelp for two salmon.

281
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,380
Hey, Maidari.

282
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,160
You're so young.

283
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,980
Line up in a row.

284
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
What's wrong?

285
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,960
The shop across the street is selling rice balls.

286
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,400
The customers are all over there.

287
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,500
What?

288
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:34,860
What should we do?

289
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,440
Senpai, we sold 50 salmon rice balls.

290
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,160
We sold plum and tarako.

291
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,400
How much is the rice?

292
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,740
Let's eat more and more.

293
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,280
Okay.

294
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,220
Are we out of sales?

295
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,900
We'll be able to sell next time, so please wait a moment.

296
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,360
Hot and spicy Texas burger.

297
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,800
We will wait for you at any time.

298
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,580
Come here.

299
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,940
Let's go.

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,520
Let's go.

301
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,820
Let's go.

302
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,180
Let's go.

303
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,440
Let's go.

304
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:06,920
Let's go.

305
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,780
Let's go.

306
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go.

307
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,060
Let's go.

308
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,100
Let's go.

309
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,220
Let's go.

310
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,660
Let's go.

311
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,380
Let's go.

312
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,100
Let's go.

313
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,480
Let's go.

314
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,940
Let's go.

315
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,560
Let's go.

316
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,920
Let's go.

317
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,520
Let's go.

318
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,500
Maidari.

319
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,680
Nsome meat is here.

320
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,680
What have you seen?

321
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:29,700
Moist, right.

322
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,760
them on the other side,

323
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,880
Do you know?

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,540
He's calling the police.

325
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Why is the police here?

326
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,720
You're going to be very worried to be released next time.

327
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,040
I prepared three rice cooker for you.

328
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,440
And this is the rice cooker that I developed.

329
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
It can make 20 rice balls at once.

330
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,060
It's a rice ball machine.

331
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,760
I see.

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,420
This is easy to make.

333
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,960
And whoever makes it can make it the same size.

334
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,900
Hey, Maria!

335
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,820
Don't put so much rice in it!

336
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,180
Why, Master Ryo?

337
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,660
If you make a lot of rice with the same amount of rice,

338
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,280
it will become so small.

339
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,240
To show the amount of rice,

340
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,040
you have to make it softly.

341
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,620
You're going to make it big.

342
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,480
Make more rice balls with one grain of rice.

343
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,640
That's what business is about.

344
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
You have to make 500 rice balls per grain.

345
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,940
How can I count 500 rice balls?

346
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,880
You can count them on the scale.

347
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,060
This is about 480 rice balls.

348
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,240
Add 20 more.

349
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,420
Okay.

350
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,980
Hey, you put too much in.

351
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,520
20 rice balls is too much.

352
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,580
I'm sorry, Master Ryo.

353
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,200
You're a good boy.

354
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,960
You're a good boy.

355
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,160
You're a good boy.

356
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,700
Ryo, I'm in trouble!

357
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,060
We started selling hamburgers and rice balls.

358
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,300
What?

359
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,180
Welcome! Welcome!

360
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,060
We started selling rice balls at Texas Burger.

361
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,260
And they are cheaper than both rice balls.

362
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,160
99 yen.

363
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,820
What a fool!

364
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,040
They are cheaper than those.

365
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,740
So we are going to go there.

366
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm going to the other side.

367
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,800
Can we sell it cheap?

368
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,000
No, it's dangerous to ride the enemy's provocation and run into a sleep-down competition.

369
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,620
The price will remain the same, and the quality of the product will be improved.

370
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,180
Come on, come on.

371
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Depending on your taste, you can choose the ingredients of the rice ball at the place.

372
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,220
Only Ryotsu rice ball store.

373
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,820
There are two thousand combinations.

374
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,000
Wow!

375
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,380
Welcome!

376
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,460
Thank you!

377
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,780
Please come in.

378
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,900
I'll also combine it.

379
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,080
Boss!

380
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,960
Cheap and delicious, the combination of three thousand kinds of Texas burger rice balls.

381
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,740
Saboten, piranha, toka-ge and sasori.

382
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,980
There are a lot of rice balls that you can only taste here.

383
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,960
You are imitating me again.

384
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,420
I've already thought of the next step.

385
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,300
Now, what is it?

386
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,040
It's a character.

387
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,600
How about a rice ball that has cute animals and nostalgic anime characters?

388
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,060
I can't lose to that child's spirit.

389
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,700
Boss!

390
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,960
Texas Burger Original Adult Rice Ball.

391
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,540
Boss?

392
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,260
This is a rice ball for adults.

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,680
Saboten!

394
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,260
This is a color rice ball.

395
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,940
It's all colored with natural colors such as coffee and brown rice.

396
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,560
It's safe.

397
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,080
But the blue rice ball is a little strange.

398
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,320
This is a colorful rice ball.

399
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,160
It looks terrible.

400
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,040
It's a rice ball covered with sushi.

401
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a rice ball covered with tuna.

402
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,480
It's hard to eat.

403
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,280
This is the ultimate rice ball.

404
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,020
It's the world's top three rice balls.

405
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,440
It's full of high-quality ingredients, such as mitriff, foie gras, caviar, and matsutake.

406
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,180
It's wrapped in gold foil instead of seaweed.

407
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,280
It's a high-quality rice ball.

408
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,840
It's 5,000 yen each.

409
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,780
Can it be sold?

410
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,500
Well, this is a special type for parties and gatherings.

411
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,040
I see.

412
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,700
My idea is infinite.

413
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,340
How far can you go?

414
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,400
It's a lottery to win a gold and silver diamond for ten.

415
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,100
Please stop it, boss.

416
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,200
If you do that, I will be disbanded.

417
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
Ryotsu Rice Ball Headquarters.

418
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,400
It has been the first to sell rice balls in the city.

419
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,540
After that, the number of customers increased with my ideas.

420
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,500
It's a great hit to develop a vending machine that can rent the power of Nagagawa to make frozen rice balls into grilled rice balls in 10 seconds.

421
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,860
It's a catchphrase that you can hold on your own.

422
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,640
A handmade rice ball set sold at a station.

423
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,940
An airtight pack rice ball that can be stored for 60 days is also a big hit.

424
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Ryotsu Rice Ball Headquarters has been taken over by the media and continues to sell steadily.

425
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,480
On the other hand,

426
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,140
The

427
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,200
I think I'm going to be a great salesman.

428
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,180
I'm looking forward to the next game.

429
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,840
The

430
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:55,900
The

431
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,860
The

432
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,720
The

433
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,240
The

434
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,780
The

435
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,280
The

436
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,300
The

437
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,500
Why aren't there any customers?

438
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,420
I think I should return it to the original hamburger shop.

439
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,340
Ryo! Do you think I'm waiting for you?

440
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,580
I don't like you.

441
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,920
You traitor!

442
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,520
And then...

443
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,380
Ryo! The hamburger shop across the street is...

444
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,620
Finally, it's broken down.

445
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,120
The hamburger shop across the street is...

446
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,440
It's becoming a more and more absurd store.

447
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,480
You've completely lost sight of the direction.

448
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,640
Thank you for the meal.

449
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,380
After that, the hamburger shop continued to change from a rental video store to a Famicom shop.

450
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,660
It seems that the parking lot has settled down.

451
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,340
Everything is the most difficult.

452
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,660
No, I can't say that it's all a waste.

453
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,040
The boom is a family thing.

454
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm going to get bored of it.

455
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,540
So, the Ryo-tsu hamburger shop is...

456
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,300
I'm going to go out to the big cliff that has a view of the world.

457
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,980
I have a bad feeling.

458
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,780
You're doing it in a flashy way.

459
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,040
Senpai, don't be angry.

460
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,360
Call the overseas media and...

461
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm going to shoot a big campaign of the Ryo-tsu hamburger shop.

462
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,580
I thought it would be accomplish a big deal but...

463
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,440
It was completed.

464
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,580
There's no mistake of getting a Guinness Book of Records.

465
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,020
This is Japanese traditional fast food.

466
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,080
It's a delivery disruptions.

467
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,800
Ryo-tsu's real comercial gusto has now completed the biggest delivery disruptions in the world.

468
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,680
President Ryo-tsu.

469
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,620
President, would you please sit on top of the rice ball?

470
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,420
Yes, sir!

471
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay, then let's make a round like the one Mikoshi does in this rice ball.

472
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,940
Oh!

473
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:14,980
Hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim...

474
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,300
Hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim, hashim...

475
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,760
Waaah!

476
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,240
I don't know what's going on.

477
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,100
Because of that man, my life is ruined.

478
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll start over again after this.

479
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
Thank you very much, Nikka!

480
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,280
Get in there!

481
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,140
No good! We're gonna burn on the other side of the warehouse too!

482
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,320
Help! Help! Help!

483
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,580
They did it again in a flashy way.

484
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,240
Thanks to that, the word "yaki o musubi" became famous all over the world.

485
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,560
But the name "Kome-chan" is going to be changed because it's going to be down in the image.

486
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,920
You were very helpful in that big fire, Senpai.

487
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,780
I feel sorry for Ryo-sama.

488
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,400
Hmph, you idiot.

489
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,440
I got punished for wasting the rice.

490
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,020
Here is my cute request for something that I broke.

491
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,540
Does that mean, maybe, that you will...

492
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,700
I will turn tailored as the staff of the U.S.A. back home.

493
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,840
Give it to me, Ryo-chan!

494
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,000
♪ Awaken the clock on the clock all day long, my little finger hurts.

495
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,000
♪ When you draw your eyebrows, you can still see the station.

496
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,420
♪ When you draw your eyebrows, you can still see the station.

497
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,100
Every day is no problem

498
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,040
When I take a hot shower

499
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,020
Every day is no problem

500
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,540
I get well with a sleeping pillow

501
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,460
Every day is no problem

502
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,020
I love myself like this

503
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,920
Every day is no problem

504
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,640
My heart is beating

505
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm drinking on Monday

506
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,420
Monday Monday Go Go Go

507
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,940
I was kicked out of the dormitory

508
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,140
and I went to the manager's house

509
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,960
This is so boring

510
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,060
I'm going to use the bathroom

511
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,000
And I can't drink or gamble

512
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,820
Damn it

513
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,100
I'll somehow change my life

514
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,500
Next time

515
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,720
Ah! The life of hell

516
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,580
See you next time

517
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,720
Thank you for watching
