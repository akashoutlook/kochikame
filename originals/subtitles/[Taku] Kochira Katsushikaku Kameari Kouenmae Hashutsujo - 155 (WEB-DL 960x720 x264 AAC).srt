1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,640
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,380
Make the room a little brighter and try to leave

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:23,020
"The End of the Rain"

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,900
Just like someone calling

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,040
"The End of the Rain"

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,040
I walked looking back

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,200
"Please give me your hand"

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,120
I felt that strange feeling at that time

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,740
So, I'll give you a rope

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,120
Just a black one

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,960
Just walk

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,660
with me

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,220
I saw it

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,340
Everyone was a child once

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,720
But everyone forgets

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Politicians with a great face

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,860
And a blue aunt above their eyes

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,180
Turn around and look at that corner

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,840
You can meet everyone

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,580
There's a wall over there

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,800
There's a wall over there

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,800
Come on, everyone

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,400
To our town

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,640
Thank you!

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,740
"The End of the Rain"

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:38,940
"The End of the Rain"

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,360
Three letters.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,420
"The End of the Rain"

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:40,800
Spring break!

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,940
Amazing!

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,520
What are you doing?

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,700
It's a finger print.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,660
I write on my back and hit it.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,540
Oh, you're really good at it!

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,200
Huh?

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
Let me try it.

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,860
Can you write in kanji?

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,400
Yes, I can write it well.

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,380
Stand sideways, left and right.

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,160
Got it?

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,920
Two letters.

42
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,120
Well, it's a little difficult.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,740
It's a character called "Yu-tsu"

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
Don't write such a number of letters!

45
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,940
Even if I write it in front of you,

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,660
I don't think you can read it.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,000
I see.

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Hey, Koran!

49
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,740
Then, Reiko will try it this time.

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,100
I'll give it a try.

51
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
What? Me?

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,520
Nagagawa, tell me the most difficult kanji in the world.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Well, how about a rose or a lemon?

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,660
Well, Reiko is good at kanji.

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,140
Say, "Baby, how are you?"

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,860
I don't think she'll understand.

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,260
It's decided.

58
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,560
I'll write it, Reiko.

59
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,320
I have a bad feeling about this.

60
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,660
What?

61
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,340
Oh!

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,460
Don't tickle me anymore!

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm not tickling you.

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,320
I heard that you don't like hands.

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,300
That's right.

66
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,360
I got it.

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
Then I'll write it quickly.

68
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,020
Quickly?

69
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,300
Ah!

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,220
Hahaha!

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
You tickled me!

72
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,040
Stop it, Ryo!

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,600
Stop it!

74
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,360
Stop it!

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,040
Ouch!

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Ouch!

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,200
Ouch!

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,460
After all, Ryo will give it a try.

80
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,880
Don't write kanji.

81
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,000
If you get it right, you'll get 100 yen.

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,280
Okay, Reiko?

83
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,080
It's 100 yen.

84
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,160
Hmm...

85
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,240
Well...

86
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,420
"Ba"

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
Next is "ga"

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,280
"Baga"

89
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,000
"Baga"?

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,520
It's your line.

91
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,080
Ah!

92
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,380
Boss!

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,860
Ah!

94
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,560
"Baga" is written on it!

95
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,760
That's how you should self-awe.

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
Damn you, Boss.

97
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,960
"Panic the mobile phone!"

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,260
Here.

99
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,060
It's a mobile phone, Boss.

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
It's not mine.

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,640
This is not my Chacomero.

102
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,200
It's not mine either.

103
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,320
This isn't it. This isn't it.

104
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,280
This isn't it.

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,460
This isn't it either.

106
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,800
How many do you have?

107
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,560
So this is it?

108
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,100
Even in a place like that?

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
Whose cell phone is ringing?

110
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,000
You guys can live without that.

111
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,000
Hello?

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,080
Hello?

113
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,200
I see. I'll just buy some sauce for the yakiniku.

114
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,900
Then...

115
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,420
You too?

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
No, I was asked to buy some stuff on my way home.

117
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,880
I was asked to buy some stuff on my way home.

118
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,240
I was asked to buy some stuff on my way home.

119
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,600
Look at this.

120
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,440
Even a general public's cell phone is a must.

121
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,780
I'm glad you're here.

122
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,720
I feel like I've become an important person.

123
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,700
I feel like I've become an important person.

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,980
I feel like I've become an important person.

125
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,260
People all over Japan are in a provide cell phones.

126
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,500
People all over Japan are in a provide cell phones.

127
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,560
But still, you think its a bad thing because you don't have any?

128
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,840
But still, you think its a bad thing because you don't have any?

129
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,140
You are an Fortnite?

130
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,900
What do you say?

131
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,320
I hate the...

132
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,400
The manner of those people who don't care about your cell phones!

133
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,780
The manner of those people who don't care about your cell phones!

134
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,760
I thought you didn't ever treat your cell phones as an excuse!

135
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,380
I thought you didn't ever treat your cell phones as an excuse!

136
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,160
If you don't like it, you can have cell phones without your cell phones forever only.

137
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:05,900
If you don't like it, you can have cell phones without your cell phones forever only.

138
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,920
Oh, that's fine.

139
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,880
I don't mind if I don't have those.

140
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,460
I don't mind if there's nothing else.

141
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,840
You said it, chief.

142
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't forget that word.

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,620
You don't have to say it.

144
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,240
They're fighting again.

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,640
It's like a fight between two children.

146
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,920
The chief gave me a cell phone?

147
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
I told you I don't need a cell phone.

148
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,820
I said I don't need a cell phone.

149
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,760
What's wrong with you?

150
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,280
I brought it because you're a good golfer.

151
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,840
I said I don't need it.

152
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,400
With this, Daisuke can always hear his grandpa's voice.

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,320
It's pathetic.

154
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
It's just a day.

155
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,680
But it's not a bad thing.

156
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,980
That's right.

157
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,900
I looked into it.

158
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,840
I heard that you had a problem with your cell phone.

159
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,860
There were many stories.

160
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,160
One of them is that a man who was injured when he went out for a walk at the age of three called for help.

161
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,920
Another one is that a man who was trapped in a sauna box at home was called to the police and was saved.

162
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,120
What?

163
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Did that happen?

164
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,260
Yes.

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,360
It's ringing.

166
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,220
What should I do?

167
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,640
Well...

168
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,920
You don't know how to use it, so don't have a cell phone.

169
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,740
I just forgot.

170
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,620
Well...

171
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,720
Press here, chief.

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,040
Here?

173
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes.

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
This is Ohara.

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,400
Here you go.

176
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,580
It's not a police radio.

177
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Shut up!

178
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,700
Hello?

179
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
Can you hear me?

180
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,160
Of course you can.

181
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,220
Oh, Daisuke.

182
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,540
What?

183
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,760
Yes.

184
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,280
It's from your granddaughter, Daisuke.

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
I can tell by looking at your face.

186
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,960
I see.

187
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,060
See you.

188
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,740
Oh, I forgot to bring a toy.

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,820
Oh, right.

190
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,260
Can you tell me your phone number?

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,860
If you register with a short-term registration, you can connect with one button, right?

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,660
Yes.

193
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,320
My number is...

194
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,260
Mine is...

195
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,960
Um...

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,360
090...

197
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,720
Well, I'll go to the library.

198
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,040
I'll leave the rest to you.

199
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Have a good trip.

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,140
Bye-bye.

201
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,540
He finally went away.

202
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,360
Well...

203
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
Ryo, what is this?

204
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,860
I was asked by Sakonji to make it for me at 20,000 yen.

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,580
I can't make it at the place you are.

206
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,620
Oh, I see.

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,320
It's such a delicate task, you know.

208
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,680
It's mine.

209
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,220
Hello?

210
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,100
It's me.

211
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,180
It's me.

212
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,540
It's me, too.

213
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,320
Chief!

214
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,560
What?

215
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,640
He just left!

216
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I forgot.

217
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,220
Ryo, tell him that I'm not here,

218
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,380
and don't play with him,

219
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
or make a mess!

220
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,560
I-I didn't do that!

221
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,120
Do it seriously!

222
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,600
See you later.

223
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,520
I was surprised.

224
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,040
I didn't have to call from nearby.

225
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
Oh, right.

226
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,680
Huh?

227
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,500
This time, it's my turn.

228
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,580
Yes!

229
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,780
Ah, Chief!

230
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,240
Reiko.

231
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,200
Did you get the water for the planter before the launch?

232
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,980
Yes, I got it this morning.

233
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,740
I see.

234
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Then that's good.

235
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,740
Thanks, Jia.

236
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,800
What did you say?

237
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,000
Did you get the water for the planter?

238
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,900
Huh?

239
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
This time, it's mine.

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,260
Yes, I'm Nakagawa.

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,880
I forgot to tell you.

242
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,260
I'm leaving at 4 o'clock.

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,780
I'll call you later.

244
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,800
See you later.

245
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,540
He said he'd be back by 4 o'clock.

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,820
He keeps calling me for all sorts of things.

247
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,600
He's like a chimpanzee who just learned how to play the trumpet.

248
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,940
Again?

249
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,320
Hello?

250
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,540
You idiot!

251
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,620
I just said what I had to say!

252
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,200
Don't make such a loud noise!

253
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,420
You don't have to watch,

254
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,000
just bite it and you'll know.

255
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Got it?

256
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,480
Do it seriously, Ryo!

257
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,740
Hey!

258
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,560
Huh?

259
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,880
What?

260
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,380
What?

261
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,080
Ryo?

262
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,100
What?

263
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,560
Are you...

264
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,140
What, Ryo?

265
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,220
Ryo, aren't you leaving?

266
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,540
What?

267
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,260
What's with you?

268
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,720
Well, what do you want?

269
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,260
I...

270
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,160
I want my hat.

271
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,600
What?

272
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,120
I just...

273
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,780
I want my hat, and...

274
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,420
I want my hat!

275
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,700
The End

276
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,880
Thanks to you, I've been able to learn a lot.

277
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,580
Ah, then, please take care of Hideo-kun.

278
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Dear,

279
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,220
even though you have a phone,

280
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,740
you don't have to spend money on your cell phone, do you?

281
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,480
N-No, it's a useful thing, so I just...

282
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,660
The phone is much more expensive than the phone bill.

283
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,800
Please don't lose it or lose it.

284
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,100
It's said that you can be used by a stranger and be charged a surprising amount.

285
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,920
I know.

286
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm not that kind of person.

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,500
Well, then, I'll go check on him.

288
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
I'll leave the rest to you.

289
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,220
Ah, finally I'm out.

290
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Well then, let's continue what happened yesterday.

291
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,640
Oh, the manager has forgotten about me.

292
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,780
Oh, the manager has forgotten about me.

293
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm the one who's being scolded every day.

294
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,460
Look.

295
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm the one who's being scolded every day.

296
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm the one who's being scolded every day.

297
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,100
Look.

298
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,160
Ah, it's Bagryu! It's me!

299
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Where are you now?

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,520
What?

301
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,680
I'm practicing in the North Pacific.

302
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,400
Ah, no, it's nothing special.

303
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm practicing in the North Pacific.

304
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,620
I thought I'd make a long phone call.

305
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,440
I thought I'd make a long phone call.

306
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
Oh, by the way,

307
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,140
Mr. Hondara said he was going to Australia for training.

308
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,300
Hehehe.

309
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,700
Hehehe.

310
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,120
Hehehe.

311
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,840
Oh, Mr. Hondara!

312
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,600
What are you doing now?

313
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,080
What?

314
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
Training the one who has the guts?

315
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,520
Ah, no, it's nothing special.

316
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,720
Ah, no, it's nothing special.

317
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,080
Ah, Professor Tondemo!

318
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,520
What country are you in now?

319
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,060
Eh?

320
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,660
Are you heading to the North Pole in a dog's tail?

321
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,880
No, it's nothing special.

322
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,500
No, it's nothing special.

323
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,020
Hello, this is Ryo speaking.

324
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,340
Oh, no, no.

325
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
It's nothing special.

326
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,280
It's nothing special.

327
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,580
It's nothing special.

328
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,340
It's nothing special.

329
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,640
What a strange person.

330
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,020
Ah, so he's in Australia.

331
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,780
I never heard of it.

332
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,280
Where are you from?

333
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,960
From Canada.

334
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,000
I just spoke with him,

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,020
he doesn't understand the meaning of the word "you".

336
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,040
No one understands it in his heart.

337
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Hum .

338
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,460
Hum .

339
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:04,840
Hum .

340
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,340
Hum .

341
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,780
Ah, who's there?

342
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,480
What?

343
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,900
Who?

344
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,820
No one.

345
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,340
Oh, is that so?

346
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,340
Oh, it's Ryo.

347
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,320
If you say ban, it's ban.

348
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,820
Watch carefully.

349
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,280
Yes, yes.

350
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,520
Now, let's finish it before the chief comes.

351
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,840
The eyes of a blacksmith are life.

352
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,520
Ryo-tsu.

353
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,880
Yes?

354
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,240
Where's the cell phone?

355
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,740
It's on the desk over there.

356
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,640
There? Where?

357
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,580
Where? On the desk of the chief.

358
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,500
Huh?

359
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,560
It's not there.

360
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,600
That's strange. I'm sure it's on this desk.

361
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,140
Ryo-tsu.

362
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,800
What are you doing while working?

363
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,040
I was looking for it.

364
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,840
Well, that's...

365
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
It's not that.

366
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,320
Where did you get my cell phone?

367
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:11,880
Huh?

368
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,040
That's my mistake.

369
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,260
It wasn't here from the start.

370
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,260
It was on the phone earlier.

371
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,980
Don't lie to me.

372
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,600
I was so busy making it that someone took it out.

373
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,860
You didn't notice, did you?

374
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,380
Listen, Ryo-tsu.

375
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,360
Find my cell phone somehow.

376
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,580
I'll pay for what you spent in the meantime.

377
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,620
Huh?

378
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
No way!

379
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,100
What?

380
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:52,260
This is no joke.

381
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,400
Just who on earth brought it out?

382
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,220
Huh?

383
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,260
Hmm...

384
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,820
"Wife's Theater: The Red Crescent of Love"

385
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,460
Yes, yes.

386
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,820
Yes, this is Ohara.

387
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,100
Oh, no, Chief.

388
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:26,980
What?

389
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,320
You said you're going to say goodbye to your wife, didn't you?

390
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,600
Hey, who are you?

391
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,620
Hello?

392
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm the head of the club.

393
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,040
Hello?

394
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,820
Hello?

395
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,320
Hello?

396
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,100
Hello?

397
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,160
Ohara-kun?

398
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,480
Hello?

399
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,200
Get married.

400
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,080
Huh?

401
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,200
Huh?

402
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,600
I've liked you since the first time we met.

403
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,100
I love you.

404
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,300
I-I see.

405
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,400
Even if you suddenly say that, I have a wife and a cat.

406
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
That's not a problem.

407
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,320
What a man.

408
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,580
Oh, no, no.

409
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,580
We're both men.

410
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,960
If you don't marry me, I'll die.

411
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,180
What?

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,740
I can't live without you.

413
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,320
You are my everything.

414
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,660
Ohara-kun, you can't be too hasty.

415
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:28,940
I'll break it up.

416
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,520
I-It's my phone.

417
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,000
Huh?

418
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
My phone.

419
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Can't you understand?

420
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,460
Come out right now!

421
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,780
Yes, sir?

422
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,540
Hello?

423
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Hello?

424
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,880
We're very happy to have you.

425
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,900
What's going on?

426
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,040
What the hell is this?

427
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,700
Hmm, Kasue!

428
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,240
Hey, can you hear me?

429
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,340
I don't know who you are, but I want you to return my phone!

430
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,220
Ah, damn it! It's cut off!

431
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,560
Yes, this is the station before the park.

432
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,940
Oh, it's you.

433
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,340
What?

434
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,620
What the hell is going on?

435
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,800
Who was that woman earlier?

436
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,060
You're about the same age as your own daughter!

437
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,560
What are you talking about? I can't remember anything!

438
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,940
Yes, this is the station before the park.

439
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
Ah, it's the director.

440
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,460
Hey, you!

441
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,140
Hello, this is Ohara.

442
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,960
What did you say?

443
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,280
You can't be early.

444
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,260
I'm glad you're fine, but...

445
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,640
Yes!

446
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,080
I'm sorry!

447
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,160
Please wait a moment.

448
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,600
Director, this is Hiromi.

449
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,740
What?

450
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,380
Oh, excuse me.

451
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,820
What's wrong, Hiromi?

452
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,340
What? I'm moving to Alaska?

453
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,320
I have a phone call.

454
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,740
It's a prank!

455
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm not saying I don't like you.

456
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,480
I'm just wondering why you're getting married.

457
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,160
Married?

458
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Hello, what's wrong with you?

459
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,220
What's wrong with you?

460
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,060
Wait, wait, wait!

461
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,320
No, no, no, no!

462
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,620
This is a different story.

463
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,420
I'm going to be friends with you from now on.

464
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,400
No, no, I mean, director!

465
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,260
Director!

466
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,980
Are you getting married with the director?

467
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,200
No, no, no, no!

468
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,040
What?

469
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,760
Akki!

470
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,740
Listen, Ryo-tsu.

471
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
No matter what you do, no matter what happens,

472
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,980
you have to get my phone back.

473
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,120
If you fail, you're fired!

474
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,240
I'm fired!

475
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
What should I do if I fail?

476
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,060
Damn it.

477
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,260
Oh, it's the director again.

478
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:57,960
Huh?

479
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:58,980
It's the phone that's gone.

480
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,160
Hello?

481
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
What's going on?

482
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,320
Here it is again.

483
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,540
Number 70, Akki!

484
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,320
Start!

485
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,440
Jyan-jyan-baribari!

486
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,280
Jyan-jyan-baribari!

487
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Everyone, get ready!

488
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,960
Let's go!

489
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,540
Next, number 18...

490
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,720
This is the pachinko hall in front of the station.

491
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:16,880
Congratulations!

492
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,520
Is the director's phone in front of the station?

493
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:18,720
No, it's not.

494
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,540
Who's calling me on my phone?

495
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,500
It's very funny.

496
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,600
They're so funny.

497
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,720
What?

498
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,680
Seriously, why?

499
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,420
Ah!

500
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone is mad!

501
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,280
Hey!

502
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,600
Who the hell are you?

503
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,500
Give me back my phone!

504
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,720
Give me back my phone!

505
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,680
If you can hear me, just reply!

506
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,700
Say something!

507
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
Ishiaki-imo.

508
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,360
This season, this time, over there!

509
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,360
Hey!

510
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,060
Did anyone with a cell phone pass through here?

511
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,920
Cell phone?

512
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,740
No, no one passed through.

513
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,440
That's not possible!

514
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,860
Someone passed through!

515
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,940
I'll call the police if you lie!

516
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,040
This sound...

517
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,340
It's the sound of the third road construction!

518
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,260
Wait! Don't move!

519
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
Damn, it cut off!

520
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,820
It should be around here.

521
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,580
Hey, I can't find you!

522
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,480
If this happens, I'll call you from here!

523
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,140
If you hide, you should be able to hear the call!

524
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,700
Hey! Where did you hide?

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Come out quietly!

526
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Give it back!

527
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
My bag!

528
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,340
Thief!

529
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,500
What?

530
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,440
Where is the thief?

531
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,460
Hey!

532
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,220
Hey!

533
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,520
Hey!

534
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,500
Hey!

535
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,740
You!

536
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,220
Police!

537
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,460
Police!

538
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:22,880
Are you going to let me go?

539
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,160
I'll kill you!

540
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,920
Thank you very much.

541
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,120
You're a nice guy, Marisa.

542
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,220
It's amazing.

543
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,340
No, I'm just kidding.

544
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,520
Because of the usual patrolling, or rather, because the manager's cell phone was stolen...

545
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:42,940
Hey!

546
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,040
Hey!

547
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,280
Yaa!

548
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,880
Ah!

549
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,040
Hey, wait up!

550
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,220
I can't help it.

551
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,840
Come and take me to the police station!

552
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,920
I'm begging you, Marisa!

553
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh...

554
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,280
Wait up!

555
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,540
Wait up!

556
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,240
Stop!

557
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
I'm going to get you!

558
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,820
Damn you!

559
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,280
So annoying!

560
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,500
Damn you!

561
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,540
You're not getting away!

562
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,500
Hey!

563
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,120
Give me back my phone!

564
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,080
You made me work so hard...

565
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,500
I managed to get it back.

566
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,440
That dog...

567
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,200
He ate everything!

568
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,940
Well, anyway, I got the chief's phone back.

569
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,160
Yes!

570
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,760
Oh, Senpai!

571
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,640
Ryochi, huh?

572
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,600
Where are you?

573
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,960
Did you get my phone back?

574
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,580
Senpai, where are you now?

575
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,200
Eh?

576
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,400
Behind the escape room?

577
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,380
There are so many things that have disappeared from the escape room.

578
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Oh, my phone!

579
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
My shoe, too.

580
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,460
The chief's favorite, the bath.

581
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,860
It was all the dog's doing.

582
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,580
But I managed to solve it safely thanks to my contribution.

583
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,860
What is this?

584
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,920
The police's secret?

585
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,740
The police's secret?

586
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,100
Ryochi, show me the police's secret.

587
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,260
It's not a "hah" !

588
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,820
Just show me.

589
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,440
Yes, it's over here.

590
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,620
Ryochi!

591
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,760
You idiot!

592
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,900
Here it is!

593
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,740
Come to think of it, I haven't found it since about a month ago.

594
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,440
I couldn't find it.

595
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,640
You're a police officer.

596
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,000
You're not keeping your important notebook.

597
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,160
What are you doing?

598
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,640
But the dog is the bad guy.

599
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,760
That's why you're playing with this toy.

600
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,860
But...

601
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,520
But not.

602
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,340
You don't have to pay this month.

603
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,960
No way!

604
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,560
Wake up clock

605
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,460
Kick it

606
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,980
My little finger hurts

607
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,140
D-d-d-dash

608
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,440
When I draw my eyebrows

609
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,860
I'll dash to the station

610
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,880
D-d-dash

611
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,660
The main train

612
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,740
I'm sleeping on my dad's back

613
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,220
This week too

614
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,060
I'm doing my best

615
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,420
Even though I can't do anything

616
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,840
I'm doing my best

617
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm doing my best

618
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm doing my best

619
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm doing my best

620
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,260
I'm doing my best

621
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,020
I'm doing my best

622
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,380
I'm doing my best

623
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,880
I'm doing my best

624
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm doing my best

625
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,500
I'm doing my best

626
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm doing my best

627
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,720
I'm doing my best

628
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm doing my best

629
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,340
I'm doing my best

630
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,400
I'm doing my best

631
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,480
I'm doing my best

632
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,640
It's almost 5 o'clock.

633
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:02,420
10 o'clock

634
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,840
I love myself like this

635
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,240
No problem every day

636
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,680
My heart is beating

637
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,860
Monday

638
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
Monday Monday

639
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
Go Go Go

640
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,260
Chief!

641
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,580
I'm Ryo Tsukaguchi

642
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,780
I'll be your tour conductor this time

643
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,860
Hot springs, food, and beauty

644
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,700
I will definitely deliver a journey that you will be satisfied with

645
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,360
Next time, "Tabimakase Onsen Tour"

646

Thank you for watching
