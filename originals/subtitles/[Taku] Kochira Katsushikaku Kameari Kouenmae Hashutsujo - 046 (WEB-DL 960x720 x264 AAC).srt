00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,620
"The One-Eyed Girl"

"The One-Eyed Girl"

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,060
"The One-Eyed Girl"

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,100
I look up at the sunset floating in the river

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,520
I kick a pebble and I fly to the shoes

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:33,140
I wonder if I'll go to the gym I used to do the savings

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as it was

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,580
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,640
There is only a single wail

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape is strangely kind

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,500
"The One-Eyed Girl"

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,380
From the fountain of the Tungari Boshi

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,800
To the sea of sea urchins

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,100
The sunset falls

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
Tomorrow will end with a burp

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,980
"Katsushika, Shibamata, I'm so happy"

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,740
I lost it and realized

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm such an idiot

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,100
"I'm such an idiot"

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,620
I'm such an idiot

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,200
In the evening

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,700
Biosan Ninjyo

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,480
New release

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,160
"Animal Crossing".

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,700
Suddenly.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,560
I want to show my cute face

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,100
"Parkard"

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,440
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:45,960
I'm needs due change

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,740

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:17,300
Ryo-san got his third day's food!

Please tell me how much you want!

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,180
That's great!

60
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,920
If it's 500 yen, I can buy a McNochie lunch.

61
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,840
Then, 50...

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,620
50,000 yen?

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,260
Huh?

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,340
If it's 50,000 yen, I'll pay you right away!

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,140
50,000 yen?

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,740
That doll is so valuable!

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,160
I didn't know that I was a doll enthusiast from the beginning of G.I. Joe.

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
Oh, that's great!

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,360
Now we have all the types of Ponytail in the early birdie.

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm so happy!

71
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,840
You're a bad guy.

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,940
Who are you?

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,460
Me?

74
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm like this.

75
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,260
Doll critic?

76
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,040
Is there such a profession?

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,480
If you have a valuable doll, I'll take it anytime, so please visit me.

78
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,160
Well, I'll go home and clean it up.

79
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,140
Okay.

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,420
I didn't know that a doll would be so valuable.

81
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,340
I still have to eat.

82
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,500
Ryo got 50,000 yen.

83
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:45,180
I'm so hungry that I can't eat that much.

84
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,760
Even a gorilla can't eat this much.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,400
Shut up!

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,500
You didn't lend me a single penny when I was in trouble.

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Well, Ryo asked me to lend you a small amount of money.

88
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,620
I got an order from the chief.

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,560
If you get an order from the chief, will you do anything?

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm sorry, Ryo, but I'll use it as soon as I get paid.

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,080
Oh, good morning, chief.

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,700
Good morning.

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,740
Good morning.

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,140
Good morning.

96
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,420
Ryo!

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,460
You bastard!

98
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,660
You should have been paid three days ago, but what's with that luxurious meal?

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,420
Did you rob?

100
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,580
Or did you buy?

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,460
What?

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
No, no, no, no.

103
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,480
Please calm down.

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,460
Ryo, tea, tea.

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
I thought I was going to die.

106
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm so sorry.

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,440
Huh?

108
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,780
I'm a good cop.

109
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,340
I'm not stealing or stealing anything.

110
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,940
Seriously.

111
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
But I don't know how to pay 50,000 yen for such a cheap doll.

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,000
There are some otaku, or rather, maniacs.

113
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,660
"Nantoka Kanteidan" or "Otakara Hakkutsu" are popular on TV shows.

114
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,220
Thank you for the meal.

115
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,760
Nakagawa, let's go paddling.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,480
What?

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,440
What's wrong?

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,500
All of a sudden?

119
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,800
Is it wrong for a cop to go paddling?

120
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,200
No, no, it's not wrong.

121
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,580
Then don't say anything and get in the car.

122
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,340
Yes, sir.

123
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,320
Well, then.

124
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,680
Ryo, tea, tea, chief.

125
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm going to go paddling.

126
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,380
Oh, yeah.

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,480
Ryo is going to go paddling by himself.

128
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,640
I wonder if it's going to snow today.

129
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,300
I wonder if it's going to rain.

130
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,740
Of course there's no need to go paddling.

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,600
What?

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going to meet the president of a doll company in Oiba.

133
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,220
Are you saying that's all about money?

134
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,820
Just think about it.

135
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,580
Dolls are money.

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,860
But it's quiet.

137
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,720
I used to hear the sound of machines even when I was a kilo away.

138
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,620
Wait!

139
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,760
We're out of money.

140
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,060
Everyone's eating the fish.

141
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,320
What are you doing, boss?

142
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,680
Ryo.

143
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,020
The doll we made last year was still out of business.

144
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,680
We're going to be in debt, and we won't be able to pay the wages,

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
so we're leaving the company.

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,520
It's a total disaster.

147
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,620
I'm sorry, boss.

148
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,220
Then what about the stock of the dolls we made last year?

149
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,920
They all went to the debtors.

150
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,940
What a mess.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,400
What kind of doll did you make with your luck?

152
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,740
This one.

153
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,440
What's this doll?

154
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,480
It's a doll made by Puffy, who's popular now.

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,720
It's real, and it swings its hips like a jellyfish,

156
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,940
but it's old, so it bends its hips like this.

157
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,640
Who's going to buy such a thing?

158
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,980
If we make such a thing, of course the company will collapse!

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
I thought it would sell.

160
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,140
If we keep this up, we'll lose both the land and the building,

161
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,600
and the family will be lost in the street.

162
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,300
Don't cry. I'll do something about it.

163
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,680
Don't take a break.

164
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
The debt is 50 million yen.

165
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,620
Ryo doesn't have that kind of money.

166
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,960
Who said I'd make money?

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,860
What?

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,980
I'll think of a doll that will sell.

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,300
Even if you're a senior, you're still an amateur.

170
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,200
You shouldn't accept cheap things.

171
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
Don't worry!

172
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Even if you're an amateur, leave the money-making know-how to me.

173
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,340
I see.

174
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,760
First, let's start with the recent situation of the doll industry

175
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,320
and research on the trend of sales.

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
Excuse me!

177
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,280
Hi, welcome.

178
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,460
I have something to talk to you about.

179
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,880
Here you are.

180
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,180
Did you collect all of this?

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,700
Of course.

182
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
There are so many GI Joe and Combat Joe series.

183
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,340
Amazing!

184
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
This is the GI Joe.

185
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
It's said to be one of the most mysterious of the World's Soldiers Series.

186
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,560
It's a Japanese soldier.

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,360
The GI Joe Japanese soldier is not sold in Japan.

188
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh, is it the GI nurse?

189
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,940
The mania seems to be drooling.

190
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,480
Oh, it seems that there is a lot of knowledge about GI Joe.

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Yes.

192
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,420
There are also a lot of birdie series.

193
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Yes.

194
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,380
Thanks to the buy from Ryo last night,

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,300
all the birdie series have been assembled.

196
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,500
Which doll did you buy from me?

197
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,900
This one.

198
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,720
Oh, the new one is the same.

199
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,300
It's been properly maintained.

200
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,640
Oh, I see.

201
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,660
Aren't these four the same?

202
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,700
It looks so.

203
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,940
I don't think the amateur can tell.

204
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,220
Well, if you look closely,

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,260
the expression and finish of the face is a little different.

206
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,920
I didn't know this difference.

207
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,660
I have the ability to become a birdie mania.

208
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,140
Oh, you sometimes change your personality.

209
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,280
So, what do you want to talk to me about?

210
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,960
Oh, the man here is the president of the Tateishi Gang.

211
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, it's the company that issued the Baba fee last year.

212
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Do you know about it?

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,760
Of course.

214
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,940
I bought it.

215
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm a Mania, so I can't believe I bought such a useless doll.

216
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,660
By the way, Kiwamono is also collecting.

217
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,600
But, that kind of thing is also a bad thing among Mania.

218
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
I knew it.

219
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,540
The company is going to collapse thanks to making such a doll.

220
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,860
So, I want to get advice from Yano and make a doll that sells well.

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,980
I understand.

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,740
Please let me cooperate.

223
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,920
Oh, thank you.

224
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,260
First of all, I would like to know your opinion.

225
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,980
I think that the doll that sells well is an action figure.

226
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,980
Oh, action figure?

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,160
Action!

228
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,160
No!

229
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,540
It's not a figure of skating.

230
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,580
An action figure is a doll that can move each part of the body.

231
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,040
It's a doll that can do all the movement.

232
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,200
Oh, you are so amateur.

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,460
By the way, there were 21 moving parts in G.I. Joe.

234
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,760
That's right.

235
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,800
If that is, you can make a good statue and oil like Japanese.

236
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,140
You are right.

237
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,140
That's not interesting at all.

238
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,900
I agree.

239
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,720
If you increase the number of moving parts, you will have more fun.

240
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,100
That's right.

241
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,440
From now on...

242
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,880
I will increase the number of moving parts.

243
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,140
You are so slow.

244
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,220
Ryo-chan, it is impossible to make a doll that sells well at night.

245
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,060
Who said that?

246
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,900
Ryo-chan...

247
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,460
Senpai!

248
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,880
Don't bullshit me.

249
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,660
Ryo is not the only one.

250
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,140
Oh, that is...

251
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,740
You made one?

252
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,900
Are you surprised?

253
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,440
The ultimate figure I made is...

254
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,380
this one!

255
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,420
Th-This is...

256
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,060
W-Wonderful!

257
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,600
Ryo-san got a ticket to success.

258
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,700
Ah...

259
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:21,400
Did, did you make your own doll?

260
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,080
I named it "President Ryo-san."

261
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,780
But isn't it cute?

262
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,360
I wanted to make it look like me, but...

263
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,100
I have to make it look like Tamagotchi, and make it look like a middle school girl.

264
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,180
That's right.

265
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,960
The celebrity's hair is the life, and the doll's face is the life.

266
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,740
It's too early to be surprised.

267
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,140
This doll still has a great function.

268
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,720
Y-You can make a constellation?

269
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,600
Not just a constellation.

270
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,440
Agura too.

271
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,700
Just like this.

272
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,980
Amazing!

273
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,580
The king of the figure skating world...

274
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,820
Even the G.I. Joe, who keeps on being the king, can't do this kind of action.

275
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,360
Of course!

276
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:08,120
The G.I. Joe can only move 21 places, but this "President Ryo-san" can move 40 places.

277
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,180
40 places?

278
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,520
"G.I. Joe's G.I. Joe"

279
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,180
"G.I. Joe's G.I. Joe"

280
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,020
I put a joint on the knee hinge, so I can bend it this far.

281
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,560
In addition, I increased the moving part by 3 places, and I was able to respond to all directions, so it's Agura.

282
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,160
I put a joint on the slowly moving part and it is Agura.

283
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,840
This is how you carry the ball on your back.

284
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,700
There are so many moves, but this one isn't a G.I. Joe, so it's Agura.

285
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,820
The hair is long, but this is Agura.

286
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,680
The "G.I. Joe's G.I. " "G.

287
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,200

292
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,920
The index finger is also independent, so you can put it in the nose hole.

293
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,560
Oh!

294
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,000
You can also recreate the hand of this Domo Domo.

295
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,720
It's amazing! This will definitely sell!

296
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,260
Let's use the Internet to send information to the puppet maniacs!

297
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,380
I'll do it!

298
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,420
That's good!

299
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,280
All right, sir! Please produce this!

300
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,060
Wait, Ryo-san!

301
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,660
I want to make a lot of things, but I don't have any money to start with.

302
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,600
Don't worry!

303
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,680
You don't mind if your boss's family gets lost in the street?

304
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,020
You don't have any blood or tears?

305
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,300
I-I understand.

306
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,880
Let's talk to the bank from our company.

307
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,560
Boss! I've got the money!

308
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,520
Oh, yeah! Then let's...

309
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
Let's decide the amount.

310
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,500
Yeah.

311
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,940
How about this for each of my tickets?

312
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,100
What? This much?

313
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,500
If you don't like it, you can just say that you didn't talk about it before.

314
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,260
No way...

315
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,580
Senpai, you have a lot of money.

316
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,080
Yeah.

317
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,620
You're right.

318
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,340
Hmm...

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,420
Excuse me, a ticket here please.

321
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,620
Thank you very much.

322
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:23,680
Thank you very much!

323
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,000
Ryo-san Dolls are a huge hit!

324
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,040
The second and third editions have been sold out.

325
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,300
Today's "Ozaku Haiken" is brought to you by the very popular "Jun-Sacho Ryo-san"

326
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,580
made by Tateishi Gang, in front of the Tateishi CEO's parking lot.

327
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,520
CEO, you have a wonderful house!

328
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,280
This is all thanks to "Jun-Sacho Ryo-san".

329
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,020
Amazing.

330
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,280
You can build a self-driving car with the money you've made.

331
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
I didn't think it would be this big of a hit.

332
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,920
Everyone has a "Jun-Sacho Ryo-san" doll.

333
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,600
I can't wait to see it.

334
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,140
Ryo-chan, how much did you make?

335
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,660
I made a lot of money.

336
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,220
One hundred million...

337
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,420
No, I think I made one hundred million.

338
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,000
What?

339
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,320
Who paid you to assemble it?

340
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,500
The groom.

341
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,820
The one who was hired to hand out the lottery...

342
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm Sato the shepherd.

343
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,220
And you are the new bride of this time.

344
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,720
What?

345
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,740
Don't tell me...

346
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,220
What...?

347
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,740
Why...

348
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,280
Ryo-san...

349
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,220
How dare you...

350
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,340
That's a disgusting way of dressing!

351
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,200
Hmm...

352
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,860
I hope you don't want me to call you out, Chief.

353
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,760
What?

354
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,860
The police decided to stop today.

355
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,160
And from now on...

356
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,040
Yes, sir.

357
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,880
Please, have a meal.

358
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,580
Vice President...

359
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,900
Project Manager...

360
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,020
Chief?

361
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,460
Well, that's what it is.

362
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,780
You should call me Vice President Ryo-tsu or Ryo-tsu-sama.

363
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,080
You, you!

364
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,480
What the hell is this money?

365
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,700
I'm the one who's been in your care.

366
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm thinking of giving you a gift for your overseas trip.

367
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,200
That's enough.

368
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,660
If you have so much money,

369
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,120
why don't you return the money you made for the lottery?

370
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,300
That's right, you have 1 billion yen.

371
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,720
This is why the commoners are in trouble.

372
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,760
I'm going to make a fortune of 1 billion or 2 billion.

373
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,660
I'm going to make a fortune of 1 billion or 2 billion.

374
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:46,740
I'm going to make a fortune of 1 billion or 2 billion.

375
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm not a man.

376
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm going to invest all my profits in the next project.

377
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm going to make a fortune of 10 times or even 100 times that.

378
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,420
What is this?

379
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,540
This is the next new project that I've invested all my profits in.

380
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,720
It's the world's first action figure of the Toshin generation.

381
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,320
It's amazing.

382
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,640
It's eerie.

383
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,180
You look different.

384
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,960
It's impossible to scale it by one-sixth,

385
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,580
but it's possible by one-first.

386
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,320
But unlike the figure of one-sixth,

387
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,280
it's too eerie.

388
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,740
It's not.

389
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,660
It's one-first, so you can wear real clothes.

390
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,640
That's true, but...

391
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,760
If you don't sell this at a fairly high price,

392
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,460
you can't get a profit, right?

393
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,580
That's right.

394
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,500
The lowest price is 300,000 yen.

395
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,340
300,000 yen?

396
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,360
That's too expensive.

397
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,860
Nobody buys at that price.

398
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,240
Don't say that.

399
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:45,780
I won't say anything bad.

400
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
But please don't.

401
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,240
I'll tell the police what to do

402
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,640
and make sure they do what they're supposed to do.

403
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,180
Stop!

404
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
This is what amateurs are.

405
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,840
The figure is immortal.

406
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,760
I will become the Phil Gates of the doll world.

407
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,720
The world's first action figure in full scale.

408
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,020
President Jun is here with us!

409
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,400
Today, it's being released worldwide.

410
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,540
Thank you.

411
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,080
A figure in full scale has been released.

412
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,260
Oh?

413
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Yes!

414
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,200
Yes!

415
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,100
Yes!

416
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes!

417
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,620
Yes!

418
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,600
The figure didn't sell at all.

419
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,400
Yes!

420
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,640
Yes!

421
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,540
Yes!

422
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,360
Yes!

423
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,840
Yes!

424
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,800
We have to carry the mountain of stock and pass it through!

425
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,340
Ryo-san, please do something!

426
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,340
Hmm...

427
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,160
Alright, leave it to me!

428
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,300
What's this?

429
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,060
This should be sold for sure!

430
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,940
Really?

431
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,080
Really?

432
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,140
It's not nice to have a hug with Ryo-chan!

433
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,800
If the business is good, anything is fine!

434
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,880
Huh?

435
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,480
There's a line in that shoe shop too.

436
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,760
Oh, that one!

437
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,920
That's my Shibuya version!

438
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,340
Shibuya version?

439
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,440
It's a very popular premium sneaker,

440
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,280
and I can't believe I can buy it.

441
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,140
It's like a popular hero's snack with a fork.

442
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,140
Hahaha!

443
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,680
Now we have zero stock!

444
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,760
Let's get the president to Ginza!

445
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,020
If you're going to do that,

446
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,520
you should drink the Ginza tea at Akasaka!

447
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah!

448
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,320
Hahaha!

449
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,100
Here it comes!

450
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,860
Here it comes!

451
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,020
Here it comes!

452
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,140
Here it comes!

453
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,500
Here, Reiko-san, you too!

454
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,800
I wonder if it's okay to be told like this...

455
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,040
I'll do what you told me to do,

456
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,720
but I don't think it's going to work this time.

457
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,560
Yes, this is Nakagawa.

458
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,780
Huh?

459
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,980
A transformation unit?

460
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,360
What?

461
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,220
Chief, where's the transformation unit?

462
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,300
That's it! That's it!

463
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,880
Whoa!

464
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,520
That's my figure!

465
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,640
What's going on?

466
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,740
Chief, we got a testimony from the witness.

467
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,920
A customer who bought a set of dolls and a pair of sneakers

468
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,440
was throwing away a male doll after taking only a female doll and a pair of sneakers.

469
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,000
What did you say?

470
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,640
Everyone's goal is to get a Reiko doll and a pair of sneakers for a pair of sneakers.

471
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,540
Hey, look!

472
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,180
The dolls are coming in!

473
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,120
Ahhhhhhh!

474
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,160
Ahhhhhhh!

475
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,940
Ahhhhhhh!

476
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,840
We can't sell the figures anymore...

477
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,380
I want to sell only a small piece of figure...

478
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,180
Wh-What became of it?

479
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,620
I'll have you pay for the cost of collecting the doll.

480
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,240
You can't say that!

481
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,260
The company has been bankrupt, and I don't have any money left.

482
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,980
It's no use crying. You're not a police man anymore.

483
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,520
No, that's a joke.

484
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,140
I don't know.

485
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,840
This doll will cost money if you don't clean it up today, so please get rid of it.

486
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,360
That's ridiculous!

487
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,900
I'm in trouble!

488
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,880
Ridiculous!

489
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,400
The End

490
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,380
Chief! I'm going to go on a trip to the Kazushika Shrine next time!

491
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,720
Why do you doubt me?

492
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,040
Why don't you borrow a super rich cruiser and enjoy a meal with a luxurious band?

493
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,540
Next time, "Gekiryu Yagata-bune Panic!"

494
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,240
See you!

495
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,940
I've heard that I'm a woman who can't fall in love

496
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,080
But I have a lot of things I want to do

497
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,420
I want to ride a motorcycle through the vast desert

498
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,140
I want to be free more than a bird

499
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,120
The speed of the Oyakas

500
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Changes the lady's dream

501
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,520
My love, I'm sorry, wait

502
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,280
The dazzling future of the panorama

503
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,640
You know, right?

504
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,460
I'm sorry, wait

505
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

506
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

507
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:35,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

508
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

509
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

510
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

511
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

512
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

513
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

514
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

515
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

516
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

517
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
