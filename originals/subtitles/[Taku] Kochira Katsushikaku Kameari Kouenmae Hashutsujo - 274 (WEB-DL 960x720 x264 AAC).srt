1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,240
"Beyond the Wall"

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,700
When you're watching TV, try to keep the room bright and away from the TV.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to my place if you don't have the money.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,940
I don't have money, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,060
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,100
I wonder what will happen in the meantime.

7
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,680
Come to my place if you don't have the money.

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have money, but I'm worried.

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,960
Look at the red clouds that are burning.

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,620
I wonder what will happen in the meantime.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,340
I know, I know, I know.

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,340
If you know, come to me quietly.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,300
I know, I know, I know, I know.

14
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,360
I don't have money, but I'm worried.

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,900
Angel 7 vs. The Wild Japs

16
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,140
This is the new mini-PATO.

17
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,340
You can control the bike with this.

18
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,400
For example, the recent mini bike incident

19
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,300
You can't chase the mini pato in the alley

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,580
But this pato can chase you anywhere

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,580
I see

22
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,740
The scooter is automatic and has mobility

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,460
I understand that but it's too much to buy a uniform

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,040
And this is the new uniform

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,160
The female pato team, Ladies Riders Angel 7

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,040
Take a different pose

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,780
Raise one leg and swing

28
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,040
It's very popular

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,100
It's like a motor show

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,080
It's something that Companions patrol as it is

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,140
It's more flashy than Race Queen

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,780
But why wasn't the white-collar member Otohime chosen?

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,540
I was told to become a member

34
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,140
But the costume...

35
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,060
Well, it's not that

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,360
Well, that's enough for the shooting

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,840
Let's do the actual performance of the criminal arrest

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,100
Please come over there

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,100
These thieves are...

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,920
Dato!

41
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,700
In the 21st century

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,820
Don't think of me as a thief

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,220
Please come over here

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,700
Please come over here

45
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm not the one who's being kept

46
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm a giant that was made up of a joke

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,040
Well, what are you going to do?

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,360
If you're going to run away with a motorcycle, you're going to have to

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,660
A professional motorcycle, a Honda

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,180
No, me!

51
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,580
And I'm a man who knows how to escape the city

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,100
I'll run away with you

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,340
Mr. President

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,260
I think that's good

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,760
I wonder if it's okay

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,460
No problem

57
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,900
We'll catch you in 7 people

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,360
Don't you have a hard time later?

59
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,780
A professional white-collar member is the culprit?

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
It's going to be a good article

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,600
No, I'm not the culprit

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,820
It's okay, you can escape

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,080
No, you guys

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,200
I'll catch you

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,980
Okay, I'm running away

66
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,720
I'll catch you in a costume scooter

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,300
Bye

68
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,420
Bye

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,300
Good job

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,760
We're both great

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,620
I wonder if you can really catch me

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,360
Angel Seven, line up

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,460
We'll follow you in a row

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, I understand

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,460
I'm going to catch that one right away

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm going to arrest him

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
I'll catch him right away

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,060
Okay, let's go

79
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,260
Angel Seven, it's time to go

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,200
The car chase is starting

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,020
See you

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,580
The enemy is approaching!

83
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,380
I see!

84
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,640
Two criminals!

85
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,340
Detect!

86
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,040
Roger!

87
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,680
Auto-cruise on!

88
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,440
Auto-cruise on!

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,760
Auto-cruise on!

90
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Marking!

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,780
What?

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,640
A rifle?

93
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,640
What's that?

94
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,380
What's that?

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,380
It's a benton!

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,080
It's a benton!

97
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,560
L-System, respond!

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,780
Turn left and stab him!

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,840
Roger!

100
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:11,980
Roger!

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,460
It's so conspicuous!

102
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,060
Damn!

103
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,160
I can't believe they're using weapons!

104
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,060
You two over there, stop!

105
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm going to stop when I'm caught!

106
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,880
Even before that!

107
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,660
Damn!

108
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,220
I'm going to get you!

109
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,980
I'm going to get you!

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,660
Damn!

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,040
He's not going to stop!

112
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,040
Oh, no!

113
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,780
Stop the force!

114
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,420
Fire!

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,340
I'm going to stop you!

116
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,780
Damn!

117
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,060
Ouch!

118
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,080
Ouch!

119
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,760
My eyes!

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,440
Ouch!

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,580
Be quiet!

122
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,960
I caught him in 20 minutes.

123
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,140
I told you I didn't want to!

124
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,740
Why do I have to be caught like this?

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
It seems that the fact that you caught the senior has become a propaganda.

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,360
Damn!

127
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,140
I didn't expect to cooperate with you.

128
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,480
Well, there are so many beautiful girls like models.

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,580
I want to catch them, too.

130
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,560
It's a great reaction.

131
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,580
It seems that the applications for the photo book are coming one after another.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,840
Hey, look!

133
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,420
The figure is also scheduled.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,160
It's like an idol.

135
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,620
All right, we'll do it too!

136
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:41,820
We'll do it!

137
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,640
Wild Yano-Tai?

138
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,940
Why do you make such a thing?

139
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,340
I can't leave it to only girls.

140
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
Does the president accept it?

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,040
No.

142
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,140
I just made it today.

143
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,560
But I'll make it great and let them admit it.

144
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,860
Oh?

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,700
The contact.

146
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
The Kittakuri group is tracking.

147
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,940
The location is Kanna-no-homen, Kameari-kousetei.

148
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,500
It's right around the corner.

149
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,020
Angel Seven, go!

150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,820
I'm going to do it!

151
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,140
Awesome.

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,840
Let's do it.

153
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,400
Let's do it!

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
I made it so that this is bad.

155
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,420
I'm going to make this greater.

156
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,140
It is so bad.

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm going to make it worse.

158
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,380
I lost my back.

159
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,420
Yoon Shun-tan, I'm not going back.

160
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,880
Twice the fast rate.

161
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,260
I think it doesn't matter to me, the low combat rate will be approximately here.

162
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,260
So I'm going to come on to the slope of Kamikaze, and I'll return with this.

163
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,460
Hurry up!

164
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,900
Resonance is fine.

165
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,020
I'll be like a human being after all.

166
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,800
Yeah, wait a minute.

167
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,160
Help!

168
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,120
Help me!

169
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,060
Damn you!

170
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,560
C-cake!

171
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,240
Sorry!

172
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,060
Let's get him!

173
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,120
My eyes are spinning!

174
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,560
No way!

175
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,500
How cruel.

176
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,840
He did too much.

177
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
Damn! I managed to get a hand!

178
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,280
Maybe you were a little too rough.

179
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,180
Hey, did you see that?

180
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,820
Angel 7 is being animated!

181
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,360
What?

182
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,180
It's so gorgeous out there.

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,880
All right, I'm going to make it wild!

184
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,960
Wait! I'm going to punish you!

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
You're just running away from the situation.

186
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,300
One, suck the lifeblood of the human world.

187
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,020
Two, the evil business of our people.

188
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,240
Three, the evil of this world.

189
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,660
I'll beat you up!

190
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,740
Varva!

191
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,620
Let's make a deal!

192
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,480
I will execute you!

193
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,760
I can't believe it.

194
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,520
He's too much!

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Idiot!

196
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,740
A bunch of villains.

197
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,280
My lord!

198
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,520
We regret that we haven't done enough, so please accept this stage as official.

199
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Will we accept such a thing?

200
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,800
Then I'll dismiss immediately!

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,400
Sorry...

202
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,320
Speed violation?

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,400
No way!

204
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,680
Hey you, dark-skinned bike! How long are you going to drive!?

205
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,080
Stay behind me and stop!

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,940
You don't remember the culprit?

207
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,140
*sigh*

208
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,780
I couldn't see his face with the helmet on.

209
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,940
Or rather, aren't you the culprit?

210
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,600
W-what?

211
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,280
That's right! You made a Wild Yaro team and made us your enemy!

212
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,760
Don't be stupid!

213
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,180
You're not as bad as you think you are!

214
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,740
Huh?

215
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,600
Yes.

216
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,080
Huh? He attacked me again?

217
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,280
Huh?

218
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,600
Huh?

219
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,340
Okay, I'll be right there.

220
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,500
What about the bike?

221
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,720
I wonder if Angel Seven's team members were attacked again.

222
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,720
Yes, I'll be right there.

223
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Let's go!

224
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,580
Yes!

225
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,180
Erika, are you okay?

226
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,120
What kind of guy is the culprit?

227
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,820
The bike is an old Honda 7-Hand.

228
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,960
CB750?

229
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,820
Yes, it was black.

230
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,240
What about the license plate?

231
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,500
I tried to look at it, but it was bent over.

232
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,860
So, it was the Wild Yaro team's fault.

233
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,160
Probably.

234
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,180
How did you find the bike?

235
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,920
It's not that difficult to find out!

236
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,180
Let's leave it to him.

237
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,300
It's been a while.

238
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,740
Do we have any time to think?

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,920
No, it's been a while.

240
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,060
To I soldier.

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,800
You're the one who knew it, right?

242
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,020
Ah!

243
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,020
The Kanto...

244
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,160
...Man...

245
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,520
...Union...

246
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,280
The Kanto Man's Union?

247
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,400
Do you know?

248
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,340
Eh?

249
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,800
Eh?

250
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,800
What?

251
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,980
Is that the bandit group you were heading to before you joined the police?

252
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,600
I think it's a bandit group.

253
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,800
W-wait a minute!

254
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,140
It's definitely a bandit group, but...

255
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,860
...I don't think the Kanto Man's Union would do anything to hurt people.

256
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,700
Don't bring the matter to the investigation.

257
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Let's go.

258
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,540
Yes.

259
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,740
What's wrong?

260
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,480
Tell me.

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,180
It's not me!

262
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,880
It's some mistake!

263
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,420
Don't take a picture!

264
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,680
Don't be so rampant!

265
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,220
H-Honda-san!

266
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,360
I won't do it!

267
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,780
Please help me!

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,900
You don't lie to me, Hijikata.

269
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,580
Let's go.

270
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,040
So you're the one.

271
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm the one.

272
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,240
You're the one, aren't you?

273
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,260
You're the one.

274
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,440
What are you doing?

275
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,520
Don't worry about it.

276
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,460
There's no need to kill me.

277
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,680
What do you think?

278
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,520
It looks like the same bike that the Angel Sevens witnessed.

279
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,260
Senpai, look!

280
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,460
What's wrong?

281
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,600
The culprit said that he had the number reversed, right?

282
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,280
But, didn't he fix it?

283
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,880
Look closely. There's no trace of him having it reversed.

284
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,380
There's no trace of him having it reversed!

285
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,180
That's true.

286
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,100
I think the elbow is white.

287
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,860
Now we can patrol without any worries.

288
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,860
Yes! Then, let's head over there.

289
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,820
Eh? The Miwa and Sato units were attacked?

290
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,740
Ohare-kun went to the hospital.

291
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,700
What do you mean? The culprit was arrested?

292
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,920
That means the real culprit is somewhere else.

293
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,760
The elbow was in the investigation room when they were attacked.

294
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,940
It seems that the real culprit didn't know that the elbow was caught.

295
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,120
The real culprit attacked the Angel Sevens.

296
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,380
The Angel Sevens are slow.

297
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,940
It seems that they were aiming to push the crime onto the elbow.

298
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,960
But, they ran away and hid themselves.

299
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,180
I will definitely catch the real culprit.

300
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,940
Sakai-san, I think that the real culprit will attack the remaining two of you.

301
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,600
I... I will stop the Angel Sevens.

302
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,860
Please wait, Sakai-san!

303
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,140
I will definitely protect you, so please be a thief.

304
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,900
A thief!?

305
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,980
You must be joking!

306
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,140
Anyway, I will stop.

307
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,920
S-Sakai-san!

308
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,120
I-I can't be a thief either!

309
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,700
I will be a thief.

310
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,880
Nana-chan...

311
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,300
If you wear a helmet, I don't think the culprit can tell who is the real culprit.

312
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,600
B-But...

313
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,400
If you protect me, I won't be afraid.

314
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
Nana-chan...

315
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,580
Alright!

316
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,340
I will help you to rebuild the Wild Yaro team!

317
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,500
Please wait, senpai.

318
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,700
I'm sorry, but please let me do this job alone.

319
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,220
What?

320
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,900
I will go and save the three of you!

321
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,740
N-no!

322
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,700
I will do it on my own!

323
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,080
Come on!

324
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,560
You two!

325
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,660
You two!

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,480
You two!

327
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,520
Come on!

328
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,020
You two!

329
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,740
You two!

330
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,560
Come on!

331
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:38,880
You two!

332
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,740
The culprit has appeared!

333
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,660
Get on the sidewalk and stop the scooter right away!

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,780
Yes sir!

335
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,700
Tch! He noticed us!

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,020
You too, CB750! Stop right there!

337
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,120
That's funny.

338
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,480
Interesting.

339
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,160
Damn it! He's driving like a normal person!

340
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,680
Honda-san!

341
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,680
Don't worry.

342
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,600
Honda's white bike has a starter.

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm getting excited, bro!

344
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,180
He's playing a joke on me.

345
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,260
I'm going to beat you!

346
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,920
I can't believe I can do this!

347
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,980
You can do it, Okita!

348
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,740
Follow me, bro!

349
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,020
I'm going to beat you!

350
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,380
Okita, I've decided.

351
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,320
After me, you'll be the second head of the Kanto Men's Federation.

352
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,820
Bro...

353
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,300
I wanted you to follow the head of the person who loves bikes and the wind.

354
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,240
Okita, will you follow me?

355
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,880
Yes!

356
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,600
I'll make the Kanto Men's Federation

357
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
into a men's rebel!

358
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,300
No doubt about it.

359
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,720
It's Okita.

360
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,640
Okita!

361
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,940
You're Okita Ryuuji, right?

362
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,280
I knew it!

363
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,160
Why did you do such a stupid thing, Okita?

364
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,760
I couldn't stand the mess of the Kanto Men's Federation!

365
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,640
They're going to run around with women on their asses

366
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:52,900
because I quit!

367
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,040
So I'll becomes a Nampana-bosougoku.

368
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,960
You should've just said so!

369
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,540
I did!

370
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,260
So what did Hijikata always say?

371
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,100
Okita,

372
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,820
you're not like your okay.

373
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,660
What?

374
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,060
Mices are for having fun with girls.

375
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,200
The time when men loved the wind

376
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,820
was over now.

377
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,700
I understand how you feel, but it's not good to have Angel Seven involved in this.

378
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,220
Okita, please do it!

379
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,040
You can do it after I win, bro!

380
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,340
What?

381
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,960
You're a coward!

382
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,000
You're a coward!

383
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,100
Okita!

384
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,680
Ah! Honda-san's white seal disappeared from the navigation!

385
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,900
What did you say?

386
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,520
Honda-san...

387
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,240
Honda-san!

388
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,120
Honda-san!

389
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,180
H-Honda-san...

390
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,160
He'll never die from his favorite bike!

391
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,280
There! It's Honda!

392
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Honda-san!

393
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,080
Hey! Honda!

394
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,980
Are you okay? Okita-kun?

395
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,340
My leg... I think I fell.

396
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
Honda!

397
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,860
Honda-san!

398
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,180
You did it, Honda!

399
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,100
Are you okay, Honda-san?

400
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,300
Yeah...

401
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,060
Honda!

402
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,320
Ah...

403
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,480
Ah...

404
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,600
You're like my little brother, Okita.

405
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,740
Please take care of me, Senpai!

406
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,920
Hmm?

407
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,480
Hmm...

408
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,660
So that's how you are.

409
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,620
Looks like you won't be able to walk anymore.

410
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,200
Now, rolled over here!

411
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,200
I want to help you.

412
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,720
Ouch!

413
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,280
Brother...

414
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,860
You weren't anything like you used to be.

415
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,340
I'm so glad.

416
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,740
Thank you, Sutan.

417
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,700
Don't say that, you idiot!

418
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,540
Konda-san...

419
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,480
Otohime!

420
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,360
Leave her alone.

421
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,780
Next Episode

422
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,640
"The End"

423
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,600
What are you guys doing?

424
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,720
You're being underestimated by the Nostalgia Club.

425
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,520
-Go and take care of Koda. -Yes, sir.

426
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,320
It seems like Honda has finally recovered.

427
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,620
Yes, it's the usual Mr. Honda.

428
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,560
Mr. Honda, I've made a sandwich.

429
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,360
Please eat it.

430
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,440
Please eat it.

431
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,460
Nana-chan!

432
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm happy, I'm happy.

433
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,860
Well, it's the usual Honda too.

434
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,000
Looks delicious.

435
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,440
Let's eat it together, Nana-chan.

436
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:12,500
What's wrong?

437
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
What's wrong?

438
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,860
What's wrong?

439
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,360
What's wrong?

440
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,300
Ryo-san's "Why is it?"

441
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,140
Ryo-san's eyebrows look like black black eyes

442
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,500
Why is it?

443
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,460
He wears sandals but he runs really fast

444
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Why is it?

445
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,660
Ryo-san always has his arms around his head

446
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,700
Why is it?

447
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,200
He's so fast but he's so popular

448
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,280
Why is it?

449
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,760
It doesn't matter

450
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:57,620
The title of this anime is so long

451
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,820
"Why is it?"

452
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,740
Why is it?

453
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,140
Why is it?

454
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,240
Why is it?

455
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:10,900
Why is it?

456
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,580
Why is it?

457
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
Why is it?

458
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Why is it?

459
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,680
Why is it?

460
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:32,420
Kankichi, Mikan is so cute

461
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,260
Let's take her for a walk

462
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,880
Oh no

463
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
Mikan is so hot

464
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,700
Lemon is following her for a walk

465
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,400
What should we do, Kankichi?

466
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,020
Next time, Lemon's raising a child

467
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,260
Please watch!

468
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,940
There's a turtle over there

469
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,220
There's a turtle for sure

470
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town

471
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you!
