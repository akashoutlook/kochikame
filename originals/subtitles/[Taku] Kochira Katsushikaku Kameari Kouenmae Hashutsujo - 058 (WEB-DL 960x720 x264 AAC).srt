Translated by æ–¹ Hou.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,340
I look up at the setting sun floating in the river.

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,520
I kick a pebble and it flies to my shoes.

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,140
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I used to go to.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,720
I was laughed at for being a kid.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,480
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere,

7
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,840
I have to be a patsushika and have a bad temper.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,720
The cityscape that never changes is strangely kind.

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,540
From the waterfront of a tangle hat

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,900
to the taishakuten,

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,120
the sunset falls.

12
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,520
Tomorrow will end like this.

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,740
I'm happy that I won't have to be a patsushika again.

14
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,100
I realized it.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,040
I'm stupid.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm stupid.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm stupid.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm stupid.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,700
My secret secretion is...

20
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,400
I did it!

21
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,540
You finally did it?

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,760
Oh, my days went by so quickly.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,480
Look.

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,780
In the 15th century,

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,400
it was Portugal's Caracas Atlantika that played its role in the Western world.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,920
It's amazing.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,140
That's amazing.

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,660
All of this is made of paper, right?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,540
Yes.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,180
Everything except the rope is made of paper.

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,820
It's the ultimate paper craft.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,040
Wow!

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,660
Are there any castles sold here?

34
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,320
In the case of a ship, the whole curve is important.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,840
It's much more difficult than castles.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,440
I made up parts and added details to the parts that weren't enough.

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,320
Seriously, you should have worked hard for this.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,540
Good morning.

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,740
Good morning!

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:19,840
Good morning!

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,780
Oh, Ryo.

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,480
Did you bring the documents to the office?

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,900
Documents?

44
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,540
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,140
The chief asked me to deliver them to the office yesterday.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,920
He said they were important documents, so he asked me to deliver them to the office immediately.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,580
Come to think of it, that happened, too.

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,300
What?

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,340
No way!

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
Come on, stop it.

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,140
Where did you leave them?

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,040
I think they were on the desk.

53
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,360
No way!

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,480
Where did you leave them?

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,860
Why is there a chief's hanger here?

56
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,120
This is a document, isn't it?

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,060
Oh, here and here.

58
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,260
Come to think of it, when I was making this, I ran out of paper.

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,640
I used the paper that was close to me.

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,880
What are you going to do, Ryo?

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,820
You should apologize first.

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,060
You'll be in trouble someday.

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,440
Damn it.

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
I don't have a way to get you in trouble.

66
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,560
Huh?

67
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,220
Oh, Chief.

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,380
Good morning.

69
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,780
Good morning.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,580
By the way, did you call me?

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,820
What?

72
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,160
No, I don't think so.

73
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,200
Oh, I see.

74
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,560
I hope you didn't.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,220
Ryo!

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,860
Ryo!

77
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:47,940
Ryo!

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,260
Ryo!

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,660
Ryo!

80
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,160
Ryo!

81
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,740
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

82
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,480
Why don't you listen?

83
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,540
Huh?

84
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,260
Did they find him that day?

85
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,440
Well, no, I just say that I don't think so.

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,580
Don't try to hide this.

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,340
Go big!

88
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,580
If you're a detective, you should understand why so many they can't see.

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,420
Yes, I know.

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,060
And that's why I create the game for you.

91
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,200
No.

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Yes, sir.

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:05,820
Yes, sir.

94
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,580
Yes, sir.

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,300
- It's nothing! - Show us!

96
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,400
- It's nothing! - I said it's nothing!

97
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,340
- Yes, it's nothing! - I said it's nothing!

98
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,600
- I said it's nothing! - Show us!

99
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,540
- Yes, I am! - Hello?

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,380
It's me. I told you not to call me here.

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,040
I'll call you back.

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,320
I remembered something. I'll leave the rest to you.

103
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,600
We managed to avoid the crisis.

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,700
Isn't the chief acting strange these days?

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,660
That's true. He seems to be in a daze.

106
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,460
He's probably on the phone somewhere.

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,100
He's in a daze. And the phone?

108
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,660
What's going on?

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,040
It's terrible. I thought it was just a TV show.

110
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,640
But the chief is also...

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,220
What's wrong, Ryo?

112
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,200
It's a fire.

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,500
It's a fire.

114
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,860
Don't tell me He's thinking too much.

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,720
He's probably too serious.

116
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,160
The chief is very serious.

117
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,300
You know that, Ryo.

118
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,180
It's so weird!

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
It's so weird!

120
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,120
If I was to watch him, he'd be so serious

121
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
he'd think I'm very serious.

122
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,580
He'd leave and go on a holiday with his kids,

123
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,760
...and only you and your wife would have been able to do it.

124
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,300
But then, I realized that a man who has lived a life of work...

125
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,340
...has no problem with his wife.

126
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,640
The hole in his heart is getting bigger and bigger.

127
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,920
And then, a young woman who happens to meet him...

128
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,280
...says something that makes him feel like he's in love for the first time.

129
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,220
And then, it's all over.

130
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,920
That chief is...

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,780
That's right!

132
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,080
Ryo!

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,420
Long time no see!

134
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,680
What? The chief is cheating?

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,780
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
It's just a dream.

137
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,460
There's no evidence.

138
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,840
But then, the other day...

139
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,300
...the chief was buying paper at a supermarket nearby.

140
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,180
I saw him doing it.

141
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,100
It's weird to think about it now.

142
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,500
Why would the chief be buying paper?

143
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,320
That's absolutely strange.

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,040
It's a secret word.

145
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,000
The chief has already made a secret word.

146
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,780
N-no way!

147
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,060
I can't believe it.

148
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,760
I don't want to believe it either.

149
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,280
Hm?

150
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
"I don't believe it."

151
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,480
Well, you were a bit early that night.

152
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,820
Oh, you're right.

153
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,380
You have a thought as to why I called you.

154
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,480
The phone from just now...

155
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
...it's definitely one of your lover's calls.

156
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,060
You showed up!

157
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,400
Seems like you're headed for the station.

158
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
Hey, don't get so carried away.

159
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,980
In a way, you're a guy.

160
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,500
You know I don't seem to have an understandable saying like "Man," or "Wife."

161
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,140
But our people...

162
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,420
You're disguising yourself as Beck, aren't you?

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,140
If you don't act like a lover, people will think you're an unnatural person.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,980
Hey, you stupid! Stop it!

165
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:44,920
Hey!

166
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,680
Oh, no!

167
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,500
If I were a young man these days, I wouldn't be here in this place.

168
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,300
Don't you know what's embarrassing?

169
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,860
You're embarrassing me.

170
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,120
That was close.

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,020
That was close. Let's go, Maria.

172
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,020
You're so mean, Ryo!

173
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
Are we going straight home?

174
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,960
No, I don't know yet.

175
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,860
"I don't know where to go."

176
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,180
I guess he didn't take the train.

177
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,780
No.

178
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,000
If he wanted to go shopping, he should have gone to a store near the station.

179
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,600
Maybe he doesn't want his friend to see him.

180
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,480
That's more suspicious.

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,520
Ryo?

182
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,660
Ryo?

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,960
Did you call your lover's house?

184
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,940
They're the same people as before.

185
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,140
They're all so careless.

186
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,380
It's me. I'm going now.

187
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,900
You're going now?

188
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,040
To your lover's house?

189
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,180
No!

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
Ryo!

191
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,280
If you're Ryo, I'll...

192
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,580
Yes?

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,960
You?

194
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,140
You're right.

195
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,640
That's it.

196
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Yeah.

197
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,760
I'll go now.

198
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,940
Ryo, it's you.

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,100
Oh, he's here.

200
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,380
I brought a present for you.

201
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,760
Oh, thank you!

202
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,280
This is where you're supposed to be.

203
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,920
Really?

204
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
-Light the candles. -Light the candles.

205
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,280
That's right.

206
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,960
I should buy some cakes.

207
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,260
Again?

208
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,420
You don't have to stay friends with me anymore,

209
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,080
but to clear our pay...

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,160
Geez, why are you guys doing this?

211
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,500
We gotta keep it out.

212
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,420
You could take your eyes off us a bit.

213
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,000
You were about to find out.

214
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,060
Yeah, I was about to find out.

215
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,500
We're in the mansion.

216
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
It looks like that's the mansion of Aijin.

217
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Yeah, no doubt.

218
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,620
Where is the director?

219
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,720
There he is. On the fifth floor.

220
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,960
That's...

221
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,100
I've finally found the decisive evidence!

222
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,460
I can't forgive you for making that young woman your lover!

223
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,920
I can't forgive you!

224
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,280
I can't forgive you!

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,520
What!?

226
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,380
No way...

227
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,240
The director really had a secret word?

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,520
You might not believe it, but it's true.

229
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,820
If the higher-ups find out about this,

230
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,700
what will happen to the director, Ohara?

231
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,780
He'll be banned from his own home.

232
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,280
And at worst, he'll be fired.

233
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,940
Fired?!

234
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,260
No matter how many times

235
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,820
you talk about this, I'm not sure.

236
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,940
You can just shut up and go.

237
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,940
If the media finds out about this,

238
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,380
the director will...

239
00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:09,100
The wife can't stand this kind of life anymore,

240
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,060
and leaves the house.

241
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,680
Aijin can't stand the cold eyes of the world,

242
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,720
and disappears.

243
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:15,580
But...

244
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,840
The director who lost his position,

245
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,340
and his family,

246
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,100
will have a sad end.

247
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Shut up!

248
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,440
Thank you, Dad!

249
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,460
Happy birthday!

250
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,940
I'm so glad.

251
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,580
Yeah!

252
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,960
Happy birthday!

253
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,740
Thank you.

254
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,760
I'm sorry, Dad.

255
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,340
I can't do this.

256
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,440
I can't do this.

257
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,060
Oh, my.

258
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,200
This is so bad.

259
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,900
This is awful.

260
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:04,960
This is horrible.

261
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,900
Maria,

262
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,320
was this really a girl's room?

263
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,180
It wasn't.

264
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,440
I couldn't see from here.

265
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,560
You doubt me?

266
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,120
Really? There must be proof.

267
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,640
You can't tell with such a small screen, right?

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
You can't trust it until you see it with your own eyes.

269
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,940
That's right.

270
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Then you should check it with your own eyes.

271
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,160
I'll take you there.

272
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,840
So you went in here, right?

273
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,860
Yes.

274
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,400
It's been more than ten minutes since we left the station.

275
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,840
This is a perfect place for a bad omen.

276
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,240
It's not decided yet, is it?

277
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,840
I think it's this room.

278
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,720
This is...

279
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,740
I'll open it.

280
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,500
No, you can't open it by yourself.

281
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,540
That's right.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,520
You said you wouldn't trust me unless you saw it with your own eyes, Roman.

283
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,380
Captain!

284
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,580
What?

285
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,260
What?

286
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:11,820
What?

287
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,240
What?

288
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,140
Captain! What's going on?

289
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,960
What are you doing?

290
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,280
Well...

291
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,360
Well...

292
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,380
You're disturbing my search activities, aren't you?

293
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,820
I'm sorry!

294
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,360
He's wrong!

295
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,640
Hey, you, Ryo!

296
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,680
You're totally wrong!

297
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,600
Well, he'll go there.

298
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,920
What?

299
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,140
...

300
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,760
It's a za-

301
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,080
Not gonna happen!

302
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,260
What?

303
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:54,980
What?

304
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Ouch, ouch.

305
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,040
It's lock-down reflection, now.

306
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,320
Oh, Ryo.

307
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,340
What'll we do?

308
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,700
Ui, ui...

309
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,520
What are you doing here?

310
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,720
Um, I just happened to pass by here...

311
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,380
Happened?

312
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,000
This is the fifth floor.

313
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,940
What are you doing here, chief?

314
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,680
Uh, I...

315
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,220
Ah, I'm glad you're still here.

316
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,780
Ah!

317
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,620
It's the secret code to the chief's ID!

318
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,400
Huh?

319
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,460
What?

320
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,780
N-no way!

321
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,500
I believed you...

322
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,960
Dad!

323
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,680
If you're going out, you should take a bath!

324
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,640
Oh, everyone!

325
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,940
H-Hiromi-san!

326
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,120
What?

327
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,200
That's why I came to this mansion for Hideo-san's work.

328
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,720
Thank you very much, everyone.

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,540
Setsu has done a lot of work for me.

330
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,020
Oh, if you have a new game, please lend me one.

331
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,860
This is my friend,

332
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,760
Malko.

333
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,040
And this is Megumi-san and Hanako-chan, the only daughter.

334
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,640
Nice to meet you.

335
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,160
What?

336
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,400
You're not the chief's lover?

337
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,960
What do you mean, lover?

338
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
You're an idiot, so you should take a break!

339
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah, the chief's fault.

340
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,580
I came to this neighborhood, and you're hiding it from me.

341
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,740
That's right.

342
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,780
Why didn't you tell me right away?

343
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,660
Uh, that's...

344
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,740
Um...

345
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,960
You didn't want your father to be teased by everyone, did you?

346
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,280
You called him "grandpa".

347
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,340
Why would I call you "grandpa"?

348
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,600
I don't have to call him "grandpa".

349
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,480
I think he's a stubborn old man.

350
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,780
Oh, is that so?

351
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,140
Yes.

352
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,280
I just retired last week.

353
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,460
I see.

354
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,060
Well, congratulations on that.

355
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,780
Congratulations.

356
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,060
So, boy or girl?

357
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,120
Boy.

358
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,700
Oh, really?

359
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,040
Congratulations.

360
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,980
Why didn't you tell me, chief?

361
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
Are you talking about a pet or something?

362
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,220
A grandchild.

363
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,200
What?

364
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,780
I'm talking about my grandchild!

365
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,580
What?

366
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,980
Did you have a grandchild?

367
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
So cute!

368
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,800
You look like a doll.

369
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,720
You're Daisuke?

370
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,340
That's a nice name.

371
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,500
I got a first-year degree from Ohara.

372
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,200
You're a single mother, aren't you?

373
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,980
So you're going to Ohara, right?

374
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,320
I decided to keep Ohara's name.

375
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,900
What a coincidence.

376
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,640
You really look like the chief.

377
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,260
Do you think so?

378
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,820
Actually, the hospital chief told me that my eyes look similar to his.

379
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,160
But people often say that your mouth looks like Hideo's.

380
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,740
I'm not that kind of person.

381
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,060
Wait, let me see the picture.

382
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,760
You shouldn't get near him less than a meter away.

384
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,300
Don't come near me.

385
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,280
It's bad if you get sick.

386
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,980
Don't call me that.

387
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,840
Who is it? What's your face?

388
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,500
You look like Hideo-san.

389
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,940
It's me, Ryotsu.

390
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,760
I think you look like a monkey.

391
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,920
A monkey?

392
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,800
You think my grandson is a monkey?

393
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,600
You're wrong.

394
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,000
I said that I look like a monkey.

395
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,940
A monkey?

396
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,240
Yes, you're right.

397
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,160
You're a noble man.

398
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,720
You're born to be a noble man.

399
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,480
Your future will be bright as a rose.

400
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,800
Really?

401
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,920
I thought you had a good face.

402
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't think so.

403
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,820
Oh, you're right.

404
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,480
Hey, Hiromi.

405
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,780
Give me the sake you brought me the other day.

406
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,220
Yes, yes. I'll bring it right away.

407
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,560
I just said what I thought, but it's not good.

408
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,520
Go on, say it.

409
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,220
You did say you were a monkey, didn't you?

410
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,920
As expected of you, Senior.

411
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,040
You're good at deceiving people.

412
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Your sake is really good.

413
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Do you have any drinks?

414
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,400
Yes, I'm doing it right now.

415
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,680
Hey, Ryotsu.

416
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
You should be a little more patient.

417
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,620
Speaking of which, I saw Daisuke's hands and feet,

418
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,740
but he's really a good meat lover.

419
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,780
That's the muscle that makes you a top athlete.

420
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, really?

421
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,240
Hey, Hiromi.

422
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Give me something delicious.

423
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,040
You brought some caviar the other day, right?

424
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,260
Yes, yes.

425
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,280
I got it.

426
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
This caviar is really good.

427
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,200
Hiromi, another bottle of sake.

428
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,140
Here you go.

429
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,820
Here you go.

430
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,320
Daisuke's face is handsome.

431
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,260
That's the best.

432
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,620
I see.

433
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,180
Ryo, it's about time.

434
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,720
Daisuke, you're the best!

435
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,640
Oh, my.

436
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
It's all done.

437
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,700
Well, we'll be going now.

438
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
Senior, let's go home.

439
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,120
What?

440
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,580
We're going home already.

441
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,360
We haven't eaten yet.

442
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,000
Ryotsu.

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,860
You're going to eat?

444
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,820
You're such a nag.

445
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,240
Speaking of which, Daisuke's eyes.

446
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,620
They look just like the chief's.

447
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,780
They look so smart.

448
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,400
Since we're here,

449
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,860
why don't we all go eat dinner?

450
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,520
Hiromi, call the sushi restaurant.

451
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,620
Seven servings of rice balls.

452
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,040
Okay.

453
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,780
Chief, is that okay?

454
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,260
What is?

455
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,740
From what I saw,

456
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,740
Daisuke is definitely a great man.

457
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,280
He'll be a great man.

458
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,800
To hold a meal like this

459
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,960
for his birthday,

460
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,980
is seven servings of rice balls

461
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,700
really enough?

462
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,240
The history might not have it yet!

463
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,920
Th-That's true.

464
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,560
Hiromi, the special dish is 10 servings...

465
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,000
No, no, 20 servings.

466
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,600
Besides, don't forget the sea urchin and salmon.

467
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,460
Yes, sir!

468
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,860
Hehehe.

469
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,240
The End

470
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,520
Oh, it was so much fun!

471
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,780
Everyone came here today.

472
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,860
Thank you very much.

473
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,440
We're very grateful for this.

474
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,340
Thank you very much.

475
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,160
I wish we could do this every day.

476
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,860
Yeah, we're in hell tomorrow.

477
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,940
Hell? What are you talking about?

478
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,340
You forgot?

479
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,920
The papers that turned into a half-bottom.

480
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,760
Half-bottom?

481
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,720
What's wrong, Ryozu?

482
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,760
You don't seem well.

483
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
N-no, it's nothing.

484
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,180
Here, drink, drink.

485
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,220
Today's a good day.

486
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm really sorry.

487
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,100
Ryozu!

488
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,680
You bastard!

489
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,300
You turned those papers into half-bottoms!

490
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,640
It was a little mistake!

491
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,060
I don't care about the mistake.

492
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,580
You're just...

493
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,280
That's right! Daisuke's eyebrows!

494
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,040
It's exactly like the president's eyebrows!

495
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,200
He's a strong man,

496
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,100
and he'll become a manly man, just like the president!

497
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,160
Huh?

498
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,840
I-I see.

499
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,620
Huh?

500
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,380
Don't lie to me!

501
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm talking about the papers right now!

502
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,340
Oh, Daisuke's ears!

503
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,420
What a great ear!

504
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,800
He'll be blessed with good fortune in the future.

505
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,060
There's no doubt about it!

506
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,260
I'm sure he'll be a great rich man!

507
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,300
R-right...

508
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,580
I told you not to lie to me!

509
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,700
Oh, by the way,

510
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,660
Daisuke's nose!

511
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,700
It's wonderful!

512
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,240
I knew it...

513
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,140
When do you think the president will be in a bad mood?

514
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,780
When he's done with his praise.

515
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,520
Ryo...

516
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,760
No matter what you say,

517
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,000
Daisuke's eyes are sparkling,

518
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,680
and he'll become a star!

519
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,040
There's no doubt about it!

520
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,500
A star?

521
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,960
No, Daisuke's cute hand!

522
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,960
That's the golden hand that will take over the world!

523
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,020
Golden hand?

524
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,680
Daisuke's smooth hands!

525
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:41,780
Daisuke's hair!

526
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:42,860
Ryo!

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,940
Daisuke's cute forehead!

528
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,060
Hey!

529
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,120
Wait, Ryo!

530
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,300
Daisuke's,

531
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
Daisuke's,

532
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,100
cute teeth!

533
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,000
My teeth are still growing!

534
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,200
Hey!

535
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,160
Don't do this!

536
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,660
Daisuke's cheeks!

537
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,000
Daisuke's beard!

538
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,360
Daisuke's lips!

539
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,180
Daisuke's mouth!

540
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,200
Ryo's...

541
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,580
Chief!

542
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,280
Chief's precious Matsutake hayashi

543
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,760
has been robbed by a thief!

544
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,720
For Matsutake's sake,

545
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,860
no, for Daisuke and Hiromi's sake,

546
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
I'll protect this unscrupulous Ryo Tsukankichi,

547
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,100
Matsutake hayashi!

548
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,460
Next time on Matsutake Security Corps,

549
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,400
let's go!

550
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,920
Thanks for watching!

551
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,780
Thanks for watching!

552
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,180
Love heart, I'm sorry, wait for me

553
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,240
The dazzling light of the future of the panorama

554
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:30,080
You understand, right? I'm sorry, wait for me

555
