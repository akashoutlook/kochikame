1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,380
The End

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,920
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,680
Make the room bright and look away

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:25,240
Like someone calling you

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,240
After the rain

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,640
You walk while looking back

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,120
At the end of the rain

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,440
Give your hand to your mother

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,820
I felt it at that time

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,540
A strange feeling

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,060
So I tried to walk

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,000
On the black tile of the Akihito Gai

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,080
Who is it?

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,380
I was a child once

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,400
But everyone has forgotten

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,280
A politician with a great face

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt above my eyes

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,500
Turn around and look

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,240
At that corner

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,020
You can see everyone

21
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,060
There is a wall

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,880
There is a wall

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,380
There is a wall

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,760
Come on everyone

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,540
To our town

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,620
Thank you!

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,760
Akihito Gai

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,540
Akihito Gai

29
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,560
Akihito Gai

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Akihito Gai

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,340
Akihito Gai

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,980
Akihito Gai

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,160
Akihito Gai

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,680
Akihito Gai

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,560
Akihito Gai

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,920
Akihito Gai

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,880
Akihito Gai

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,040
Akihito Gai

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,340
Akihito Gai

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,520
Akihito Gai

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,020
Akihito Gai

42
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,680
Akihito Gai

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,740
Akihito Gai

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,680
Akihito Gai

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,940
Akihito Gai

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,960
Akihito Gai

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Video Cameraman

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Money, money, money.

49
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,900
Hmm, that's a lot.

50
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,500
Are you looking for a part-time job?

51
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,120
I just got paid last week.

52
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,780
That's not true. I used it on that day.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,560
What?

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,120
You can't live a joyful life with just a salary.

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,700
Some people earn 300,000 yen with a freighter.

56
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,580
I can't stand people who don't get a job.

57
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,140
I can't stand people who don't get a job.

58
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,820
I'm going to work as a freighter from today.

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,740
But you're a civil servant.

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,200
So I'm going to work as a freighter while being a civil servant.

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
The pay will double.

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,280
Oh?

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,620
Oh?

64
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,820
8,000 yen for a full-time job.

65
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,320
That's it!

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,040
No!

67
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:19,960
I'm disqualified.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,800
If I come with a young man, everyone will be flustered.

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,820
Next, next.

70
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Move, move, move.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,360
8,000 yen for a full-time job.

72
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,420
There's no doubt about it.

73
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,060
Yeah, of course.

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,800
Oh, good.

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,040
First inspection passed.

76
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,780
Second inspection as it is.

77
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,500
Hey, Kiroko.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,760
Happy 30th anniversary.

79
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,300
Happy 90th anniversary.

80
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,600
30th inspection begins the modern revolution.

81
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,900
Yes, yes.

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
There are only four remaining.

83
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,920
Good.

84
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,800
In this journey,

85
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,300
I have passed the 30th anniversary of overseas experience television

86
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,040
of Taitokyo TV

87
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,660
in my own company.

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,540
This is really honorable.

89
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,120
With great luck,

90
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,480
I would like to make this project a success.

91
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,300
So what should we do?

92
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes.

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,780
Tomorrow,

94
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,640
with all of us,

95
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,860
I, the director,

96
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm the director, the cameraman, the sound man, the assistant director, so AD.

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,580
This is the basic of the staff.

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,380
And you guys will be the assistant of AD.

99
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,000
So it's AAD.

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
It's like DDT.

101
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,540
It's like DDT.

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Super Idol, the shining star, Alps.

103
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,620
It's a project that makes idols popular.

104
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,100
We're going to walk from here.

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,960
All four of us will carry this equipment to the top of the mountain.

106
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,260
You have to be strong.

107
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,700
Ouch!

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:01,980
Ouch!

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,880
We're not carrying it.

110
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,220
We're carrying it.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,640
We're not going to waste a minute or a second.

112
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,500
The president of the old Katagi's hot TV man's survival is famous in the industry.

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,680
Don't talk nonsense!

114
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,860
I'm a super idol.

115
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
You have to be prepared because you can work three times as much as you can.

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,380
I don't complain if I get a part-time job.

117
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,940
This is this.

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,520
Then the CD campaign is like that.

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,260
Thank you.

120
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,900
Thank you for your hard work.

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,080
Thank you for your cooperation today.

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Thank you.

123
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,200
The air is fresh.

124
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Hikaru-chan.

125
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,200
It's Hikaru, the shooting star.

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,420
Hikaru-chan.

127
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,940
Thank you for your cooperation.

128
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,860
Thank you for your cooperation.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Yes.

130
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,160
Hikaru, the shooting star, is motivated.

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm motivated.

132
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,600
A little more.

133
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,440
Let's make a good show.

134
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,140
Yes.

135
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,880
President!

136
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,060
If you are so violent, Hikaru will be broken.

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
Oh, this is rude.

138
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,760
What are you talking about?

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,260
Get ready quickly.

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,600
Then, first of all, I will take the first shot of the departure here.

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,380
Next, the camera will follow Hikaru-san walking along the river.

142
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,580
Yes.

143
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,060
What?

144
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,780
Did you just say to Hikaru, the shooting star, to walk on the mountain road?

145
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
Did you hear that?

146
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,760
You said to walk on the super idol.

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
It's a climbing program, so you have to walk.

148
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,420
Hikaru, the shooting star, won't walk more than five times.

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,500
Why?

150
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,740
Because I'm an idol.

151
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,780
Two.

152
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm a salesman with three or four super idols.

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm a salesman with three or four super idols.

154
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,820
I'm a salesman with three or four super idols.

155
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,440
Do you understand?

156
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,640
But unfortunately, we can't get a car from here.

157
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,620
If Hikaru-san doesn't walk, we won't be able to shoot, but...

158
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,120
Is that so?

159
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,460
Then it can't be helped.

160
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,260
Let's go home, Hikaru-chan.

161
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,360
Hey, wait a minute.

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,760
Are you going to come all the way here and get off the show?

163
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,100
It's ridiculous.

164
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,700
I just want to return it to other production companies.

165
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,760
What did you say?

166
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
If that's the case,

167
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,420
You're not going to be able to cross this industry, are you?

168
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,620
Of course I can.

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,620
That's the privilege of a popular idol.

170
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,880
Change the production company?

171
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,220
What about our part-time job?

172
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
It's not a joke!

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,120
I won't return it.

174
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,820
Please move.

175
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,340
Hey, boss.

176
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,360
It's a joke to walk Hikaru-chan.

177
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,040
It's tough.

178
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,960
Super idol shooting star Hikaru is standing there.

179
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,320
It's the same as climbing.

180
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,500
In other words,

181
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,240
Even if I'm not there,

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,840
It's the same as the top of Everest.

183
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
It's the same as climbing.

184
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,340
Thank you.

185
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,080
Thank you.

186
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,360
Boss, do you have a helicopter?

187
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,680
What?

188
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,900
It's a helicopter that carries Hikaru-san to the top of the mountain.

189
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,080
It's a helicopter that carries Hikaru-san to the top of the mountain.

190
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
If the show goes on like this,

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,540
All that's left is the red paper.

192
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,000
Is that okay?

193
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,880
That's...

194
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,500
Then it's a loss, isn't it?

195
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,500
What?

196
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,360
What?

197
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,620
But now the helicopter is coming.

198
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,000
You don't have to call me that now.

199
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,200
You don't have to call me that now.

200
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,260
Selfish idol shooting star Hikaru.

201
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,800
Escape from the scene on the day of the recording.

202
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,760
A good story that has a wide show.

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,820
A climbing idol is a small scandal.

204
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,460
There are so many stories that it can't be restored.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,960
There are so many stories that it can't be restored.

206
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,580
There are so many stories that it can't be restored.

207
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:34,880
It's scary.

208
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,820
Is that so?

209
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,800
Is that a helicopter?

210
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,280
Then, Soton,

211
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,980
The president should have said it earlier.

212
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,560
Then, Soton,

213
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,740
I'll bring you negotiation.

214
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,860
Ahaha...

215
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,300
I'll bring you negotiation.

216
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
Then I will give you a voice of starting with Title Bag.

217
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,140
Take 1.

218
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,300
Nihon Alps will be conquered.

219
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,600
Take 1.

220
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,980
Nihon Alps will be conquered.

221
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,060
Take 1.

222
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,860
It's come to an end.

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
It's come to an end.

224
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,940
It's come to an end.

225
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,800
Well then, I'll wait for you up there.

226
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,220
Hey hey.

227
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,900
Carry heavy equipment with you.

228
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,820
Hey, hey.

229
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,820
Damn it!

230
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,780
Damn it!

231
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,820
Let's go! Don't be lazy!

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,820
Hurry up! Get on the helicopter first!

233
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,660
It's impossible to get on the helicopter first!

234
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,260
If you have time to talk, then hurry up and walk!

235
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
The hourly wage for that is 8,000 yen!

236
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,280
There are 2 km left! Do your best!

237
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm out of breath! I can't take it anymore!

238
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,760
Hey, don't be so stubborn!

239
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,240
You're going to work part-time?

240
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,380
I'll take care of the luggage!

241
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,140
Oh, I see! I'm counting on you!

242
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,880
However, I'll take your part-time wage!

243
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,600
That's fine!

244
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,580
But there are too many spare batteries!

245
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,620
One battery weighs 1.5 kg, so 100 batteries will weigh 150 kg!

246
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,640
Without batteries, the camera won't work.

247
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,760
I didn't overdo it.

248
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,180
I'm sorry!

249
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,280
Next!

250
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,080
He's also out of money!

251
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,160
Leave it to me!

252
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,100
It's heavy!

253
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,880
However, the part-time wage for 3 people is 24,000 yen!

254
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,580
I'm out of money, too!

255
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,100
In the end, the director, the cameraman, the sound man, and I were 4 people!

256
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
It's like I'm going to give birth to a baby!

257
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm going to give birth to a baby!

258
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,260
I'm going to give birth to a baby!

259
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,000
Damn, I'm late.

260
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,820
I couldn't wait for super idols.

261
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,760
Well, it was quite late.

262
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,320
I thought I'd go home because it was too late.

263
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,660
Hahaha!

264
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,820
Mr. Hikaru

265
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,340
Mr. Hikaru

266
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,380
Mr. Hikaru

267
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,900
Mr. Hikaru

268
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,380
Mr. Hikaru

269
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,180
Mr. Hikaru

270
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,400
Mr. Hikaru

271
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
Mr. Hikaru

272
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Mr. Hikaru

273
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,220
Mr. Hikaru

274
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,900
Mr. Hikaru

275
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,520
Mr. Hikaru

276
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,580
Mr. Hikaru

277
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,560
Mr. Hikaru

278
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,300
Mr. Hikaru

279
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,420
Mr. Hikaru

280
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:28,900
Mr. Hikaru

281
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,000
Mr. Hikaru

282
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,060
Mr. Hikaru

283
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,160
Mr. Hikaru

284
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,640
Mr. Hikaru

285
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:31,860
Mr. Hikaru

286
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,200
Mr. Hikaru

287
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,440
Mr. Hikaru

288
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,460
Mr. Hikaru

289
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,800
Mr. Hikaru

290
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,000
Mr. Hikaru

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Mr. Hikaru

292
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,560
Mr. Hikaru

293
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,200
Mr. Hikaro

294
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,320
Mr. Hikaru

295
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,520
Mr. Hikaru

296
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
Mr. Hikaru

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,160
Mr. Hikaru

298
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,060
This is great!

299
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,200
Excuse me.

300
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,320
Thank you for your hard work.

301
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,320
If this is a shooting, I don't have to go up the mountain, but I can shoot in the studio.

302
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,120
I want to walk on my own.

303
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,180
I want to walk.

304
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,840
I want to walk.

305
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,280
What? If you want to walk, you have to walk.

306
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,020
If you want to walk, you have to walk.

307
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,420
If you want to walk, you have to walk.

308
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,280
How is it?

309
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,740
It's okay if you walk.

310
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,580
We're going to the next park!

311
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
Can you let us ride it?

312
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,220
Yasuzawa, your face is pale. Are you okay?

313
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,380
It's been a while since Tetsuya.

314
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,900
Hold on tight!

315
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm sorry.

316
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,200
Why would you do these things to me?

317
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,160
Give me a break!

318
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,080
*Sigh*

319
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,660
Okay, that's enough.

320
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,640
Good work.

321
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,380
Finally, the staff is just me and the president.

322
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,700
Hmm, no matter what you do, Hikaru-chan is still cute.

323
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,880
However, climbing up the mountain is not fun.

324
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
Hmm...

325
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,900
Oh, there it is!

326
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
The fire is falling from that tree.

327
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,540
Hikaru, the shooting star, will save it and put it back into the tree.

328
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,680
It will be a great scene where Hikaru-chan's kindness will be expressed.

329
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,840
Ugh...

330
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,400
Don't let me climb up or walk. How can I get it?

331
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,160
First of all, let me do this!

332
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,420
Oh, you say you can't get it?

333
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,860
Of course!

334
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,780
Then, there's no choice.

335
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,040
Now, let's go home.

336
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,640
Wait a minute!

337
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,600
This is a part-time job for five people!

338
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,500
How can you give up so easily?

339
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,580
Why don't you tell me when you die?

340
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,900
Oh...

341
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,980
When you die...

342
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:28,140
Let's go!

343
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,980
Ah, Hinaga!

344
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,980
Okay.

345
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,180
I'll be back soon.

346
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,220
Hmm...

347
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,620
Well, you can use it if you're angry.

348
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,220
I'll borrow it for a while.

349
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,100
Okay.

350
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,260
I'll return it soon.

351
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,040
Yes.

352
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,160
Hmm?

353
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,460
Ouch!

354
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,240
Ouch!

355
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,240
Stop it!

356
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,700
Ahhhh!

357
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,720
The price is 40,000 yen!

358
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,120
Now, go back to the country.

359
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,960
Yes. Okay.

360
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,300
I'll get it back.

361
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,860
Wonderful!

362
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,600
You're the best, Hikaru!

363
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,320
You're kind and the fans are already tears.

364
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,440
Now, not only young people but also middle-aged hearts can come here!

365
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,140
Ahhhh!

366
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,980
Ah, it's beautiful.

367
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,540
Yes. Okay.

368
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,600
Thank you for your hard work.

369
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,380
Oh, what kind of fruit is this?

370
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,380
Well...

371
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,540
It's pretty, isn't it?

372
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,640
It's a potato.

373
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,840
Oh, I see.

374
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,580
Can you eat it?

375
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,440
Yes.

376
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
It's good!

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,960
But you know it well.

378
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,060
Before my debut, my father took me to the mountains.

379
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
That's unusual.

380
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,960
I was quite good at it.

381
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:09,980
Hahaha.

382
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,860
Oh!

383
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,140
It's a good face!

384
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,740
Alright, let's shoot a scene where I eat a potato.

385
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,640
Yes, sir!

386
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Oh, my, my, my!

387
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,480
Hikaru-chan, you shouldn't eat this.

388
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,720
But everyone is eating it.

389
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,900
No, you can't.

390
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,060
If you break your stomach, you can use it for tomorrow's work, right?

391
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,480
It's a little fine.

392
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,240
Hikaru, the shooting star,

393
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,200
If you take a break from one show,

394
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
you'll get tens of thousands of red beans.

395
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,580
Will you take responsibility for me?

396
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,200
Tens of thousands!

397
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,880
Then, I'll take a different shot.

398
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,900
Yes, that's it.

399
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,780
Oh, it's not good.

400
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,700
After all, Hikaru-chan doesn't like wild vegetables.

401
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,620
Let's stop.

402
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Hikaru-chan, let's go next.

403
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,820
Yes, sir.

404
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,120
Yes, sir.

405
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,800
Yes, sir.

406
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,100
Yes, sir.

407
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,080
We'll take a shot of Hikaru-chan swimming.

408
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,920
Yes, sir.

409
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,000
I see, sir.

410
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,960
Will you take a shot of Hikaru-chan swimming?

411
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,540
Yes, sir.

412
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,420
Yes, sir.

413
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,660
I don't know.

414
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,060
Will you take a shot of her swimming?

415
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,220
No, sir.

416
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,920
Hey! Hey! The water's...

417
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,380
What? The screen is...

418
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,440
Ah! The cameraman's sinking!

419
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,320
You idiot!

420
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,180
You're gonna fill up the water? Be careful!

421
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,360
It's rocks! I'm gonna crash!

422
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,340
I'm so thirsty...

423
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,940
Ouch!

424
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,240
Ouch!

425
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,480
It's not the temple's money! You idiot!

426
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,740
I'm sorry.

427
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,220
But it's not fun to just swim.

428
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,980
How about...

429
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,160
Oh! That's it!

430
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,840
How about jumping into a waterfall from that rock?

431
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,460
This will be a thrilling video.

432
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,820
The fans will be sweating.

433
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,200
I can't take it anymore.

434
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,540
I can't make him jump again.

435
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,020
Of course.

436
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,340
This program is a documentary.

437
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,420
There are so many lies and frauds.

438
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,620
Where is the documentary?

439
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,060
I don't like it.

440
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,120
Whether it's a lie or a drama,

441
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,300
we just want to impress the viewers.

442
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,780
No!

443
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
The real video is the most touching.

444
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,040
The viewers are waiting for the idol, Hikaru Nagareboshi.

445
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,900
No one wants the real Hikaru Nagareboshi.

446
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
The giant statue we're making...

447
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,220
Hikaru Nagareboshi is the real Hikaru Nagareboshi.

448
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,020
She's just an idol.

449
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,940
She's just a fake.

450
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,700
Okay, enough.

451
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,380
If you want to walk, you can walk.

452
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,320
Hikaru Nagareboshi

453
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,640
Can you say a phrase like "No" when you die?

454
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,560
I can do it, too.

455
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,100
I can do it, too.

456
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,140
It's awful.

457
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,840
That's all half of it.

458
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,180
Isn't it, Hikaru-chan?

459
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm going to swim.

460
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,740
What? Did you say something?

461
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,620
Hikaru-chan?

462
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,780
I'm going to swim.

463
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,180
What's wrong, Hikaru-chan?

464
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,800
I can do it too! I'm not a doll!

465
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Hey, hey, Hikaru-chan!

466
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,520
Hikaru!

467
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,200
Th-this is...

468
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,980
Hikaru-chan!

469
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:53,520
Hikaru-chan!

470
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,540
Hikaru-chan...

471
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,960
Hikaru!

472
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,460
How nice it feels!

473
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,420
I've been forgetting this feeling for a long time.

474
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,160
What did you say? You're retiring from the entertainment world?

475
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,760
From now on, I'll be a child.

476
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,740
I'll walk the path I believe in with my own feet.

477
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,940
Why are you doing that all of a sudden?

478
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,500
This Ryotsu-san taught me.

479
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,540
What?

480
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,580
Thank you for waking me up.

481
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,700
No, I...

482
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,360
Is it your fault? What did you do to Hikaru? What did you do to Hikaru?

483
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,720
I don't know anything!

484
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,240
And then, I have a request.

485
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,440
Please stop broadcasting this video.

486
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,720
That's not who I really am.

487
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,200
You're just lying.

488
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,220
I'm not joking!

489
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,220
If you really retire, this is your last job, isn't it?

490
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,760
You can't just send me such a precious video, can you?

491
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,940
A precious video?

492
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,160
Oh, President. Please keep that tape tightly.

493
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,060
Don't worry about it. I won't let anyone touch it.

494
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,320
I won't let anyone touch it.

495
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,240
I'm sorry, President. For my sake...

496
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,040
No, I'm the one who should thank you.

497
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,180
Thanks to you, I woke up. Thank you.

498
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,700
Wait a minute! What about my pay?

499
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,220
I'm retiring from the entertainment world. I'm sorry, but I won't give you my pay.

500
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,560
What?

501
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,000
I worked so hard, but I only get 40,000 yen for my pay?

502
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,460
It's all your fault!

503
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,020
I'll make you pay! I'll sue you!

504
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,640
No, I'm not a victim!

505
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,180
Senpai, you did it again.

506
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,640
You're a star now.

507
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,500
What's next?

508
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,180
Everest? Matterhorn?

509
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,520
Did you climb the Amazon River?

510
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,080
You're the only king in the South Pole.

511
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,820
That's amazing!

512
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm retiring from the entertainment world and going to the adventure world.

513
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm surprised.

514
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,340
Thanks to you, I made fans all over Japan my enemy.

515
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,240
I was a great man.

516
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,540
I told them to walk on their own feet, but I didn't tell them to walk to the South Pole.

517
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,620
I finally arrived at the South Pole.

518
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,380
The wind was like a lie until yesterday.

519
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,000
Hikaru, get a little closer to the penguin.

520
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,840
Idiot!

521
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
It's a documentary to capture the moment of love.

522
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,800
Thank you for your support.

523
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,460
And what I have now is the money of a staff who taught me to walk on my own feet.

524
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,640
Thank you, Mr. Kan-kichi Ryotsu.

525
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,800
The End

526
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:32,020
To Be Continued

527
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,040
Every day is no problem

528
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,960
When I take a hot shower

529
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,960
Every day is no problem

530
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,480
I recover my health with a sleeping pillow

531
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,380
Every day is no problem

532
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,960
I love myself like this

533
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,860
Every day is no problem

534
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,580
My heart is beating

535
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,740
I'm flying on Monday

536
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,500
Monday, Monday, Monday

537
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,180
In the rice naming contest,

538
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,260
the rice I made won

539
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,080
and I got a lot of rice

540
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,600
But I can't finish it by myself

541
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,760
Let's start a business with this

542
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,480
Next time, "Traveling between rice and rice balls"

543
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,020
See you next time

544
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,660
Thank you for watching
