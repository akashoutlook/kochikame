1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,620
I look up at the sunset that floats in the middle of the sea

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,360
I kick a pebble and fly to the end

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,660
I wonder if I'm going to the taiko that I jockeyed

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,720
I was laughed at that it was just a joke

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,740
Even if you cheer up somewhere, it's only for the sake of winning

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,980
The cityscape that doesn't change even if you yawn is strangely kind

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,440
The sun is already setting because the crows are crying

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,860
The grilled chicken is in the way

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,340
The beer is in the way

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,780
The

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,960
The sun is setting

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,960
Tomorrow will end soon too

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,580
But I lost my happiness again

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,180
I realized that I'm a fool

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,260
But I lost my happiness again

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,540
Yeah

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,620
"Higurashi Tazunete 3000 Ri"

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,280
Please take a look.

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,400
The battle stage of the Athens Olympics is ready.

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,340
All that's left is to wait for the opening ceremony.

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,380
Finally, the Athens Olympics.

23
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,520
Tomorrow's the opening ceremony, right?

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,820
It's the festival of sports held once every four years.

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,340
What's wrong, senpai?

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,120
Once every four years?

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
It's like something else happened.

28
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,260
What happened four years ago?

29
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,140
Four years ago was the 2000th anniversary.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,600
That's right. The 2000th anniversary problem.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,100
There was a time when the computer was misoperated

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,340
when the 2000th anniversary was about to happen.

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,260
After all, it wasn't big deal.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,700
No, no, that's not it!

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,480
Something important other than that

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,040
I think I was a charismatic employee.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,880
It was about four years ago.

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,960
That's when there was a lot of charisma in town.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

42
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,100
It seems that someone came.

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,660
The End

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,460
What's this document?

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
It's a file about the unsolved case.

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,700
No, no, the Olympics are about to start.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,780
That guy hasn't woken up yet.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,960
That guy? That guy means...

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,480
I see! This year is the year of the sunrise!

50
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,800
Let me explain the year of the sunrise for the first time.

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,160
The real name is "Higurashi Neruo".

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,300
He's a police officer.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,640
He's a member of the Goenmai Police Station.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,040
He used to like to sleep, but he's been sleeping for a long time.

55
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,700
Now he only wakes up once every four years, in the year of the Olympics.

56
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,460
In return, he has a great superpower.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,180
In the short amount of time he's awake,

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,800
he can solve many unsolved cases.

59
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,360
That's why he doesn't get fired from the police.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,320
However...

61
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,540
If he accidentally wakes up in the year of the Olympics,

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,880
it's a big deal, so you need to be careful.

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Speaking of the year of the Olympics, it's the year of the sunrise.

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,440
I think Athene wanted to see it too.

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680
What? You're still not here?

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,300
Wake him up quickly!

67
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,600
There are so many incidents that require his power!

68
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,860
We told you, didn't we?

69
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah...

70
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,460
Ryotsu, you take him with you.

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,680
No, you're the only one who's not here, so go with Nakagawa.

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,880
I think the room of Higurashi is...

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,900
Wake up, Higurashi!

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,540
The Olympics are starting!

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,260
What is it, Ryotsu?

76
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,820
Why are you here?

77
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,220
This is Higurashi's room!

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,020
Huh?

79
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,260
It's been my room since I replaced Ryo the other day.

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,940
Come to think of it,

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,480
there was no room for Higurashi when you replaced Ryo.

82
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,900
Then where is Higurashi now?

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,300
That's right!

84
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,240
Over there!

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,280
What a strange room!

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,940
There's a corpse of an unknown person.

87
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,880
It's a place where the corpse of an unknown person is placed, isn't it?

88
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,280
What kind of place is this?

89
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,280
He said he wanted to sleep in a quiet place.

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,580
It's quiet here, isn't it?

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,760
That's true.

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,440
It's probably around here...

93
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,020
Ah, this is it!

94
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,440
Hey, Higurashi, wake up!

95
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,520
He's not here!

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,420
What?

97
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,560
What's going on, Ryotsu?

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,280
I don't know, either!

99
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,060
I'm in charge of the

100
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,740
haunted room, but...

101
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,860
Where is Higurashi?

102
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,980
Higurashi?

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,320
He was sleeping in the haunted room!

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,260
Oh...

105
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,360
He was in locker C-3.

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Locker C-3...

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh, by the way...

108
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,500
Um...

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,920
The other day, he saw a foreign person

110
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,400
and he took him away.

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,160
What?

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,220
A foreign person?

113
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,520
Yes.

114
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,920
He's a resident of Saitama, his name is Mr. Megurashi.

115
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,120
His husband, who was in a coma for many years,

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
heard rumors that he passed away in Tokyo,

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,360
so his family came to look for him.

118
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,420
His physical condition is the same as his family's.

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,800
Above all, he had a paper written "Megurashi" on the locker.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,660
Idiot!

121
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,700
Look carefully!

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,820
It's not a eye, it's a fire!

123
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
Oh, it's true.

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,400
I don't want you to be so surprised, but...

125
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,460
The person who was there was my officer.

126
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

127
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,020
Listen, calm down.

128
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,380
He's alive!

129
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,820
What?

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,760
What?

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,440
N-Nii-san...

132
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,880
He's so calm...

133
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,020
He's like a different person...

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,460
He must have suffered a lot in Tokyo...

135
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,900
He's moving!

136
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,440
It's just my imagination...

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,940
The house is closed...

138
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm sure he did a good job.

139
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,960
It's okay, dad.

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,660
Did he set the power?

141
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,360
No, no one's coming out.

142
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,200
Maybe he's going to a funeral.

143
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,500
A funeral?

144
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,560
Yes, I think so.

145
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,380
I heard he was going to a special ceremony today.

146
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,260
You should have said something like that earlier!

147
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,240
If he dies, I'll be taken care of.

149
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,940
No, I think he's already taken care of...

150
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,320
Uh, do you have an emergency contact?

151
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
Like a cell phone?

152
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,920
Speaking of which, my little brother's cell phone is...

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,300
It's starting.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh, who is it?

155
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,500
Please hang up.

156
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
It's not working...

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,280
What should we do?

158
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,660
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,660
It's not Megurashi.

160
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,820
No, it's not.

161
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,000
Megurashi.

162
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Megurashi.

163
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,620
Senpai.

164
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Huh?

165
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,320
What are you doing, Nakagawa?

166
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,160
You're just trying to see if Higurashi will be cremated or not.

167
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,800
This?

168
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,680
This is Megurashi's funeral.

169
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,600
This is it!

170
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,140
Oh!

171
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,800
This is the house.

172
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,060
There's no doubt about it.

173
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,660
It says the funeral place.

174
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,700
Call me right away!

175
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,280
Yes.

176
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,920
Yes.

177
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,360
If Megurashi was the funeral place, it's definitely our house.

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,240
I see.

179
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,620
Call the organization immediately!

180
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:42,940
Even if you say that, the funeral was just over and everyone went to the cremation site.

181
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,660
What?

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Cremation!

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:47,960
Huh?

184
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,560
Nakagawa, let's go!

185
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,360
Yes.

186
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,580
Anyway, if we don't stop it, Higurashi will be cremated!

187
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,860
We can't use the phone for about 10 minutes.

188
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,920
Now our Hikari Cable is open.

189
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,520
Now the family's cremation is ready.

190
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Damn it!

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,180
Why doesn't it work?

192
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,660
Oh, Higurashi.

193
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,320
The last farewell.

194
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,660
Brother, I don't have to have painful memories anymore.

195
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,100
Sleep well.

196
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,380
I felt like I moved.

197
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,920
Stop it.

198
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,420
You won't be able to travel to that world without worry.

199
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,700
It's okay.

200
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,860
Yes.

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,840
I heard Higurashi's voice.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,140
Brother is saying goodbye to everyone.

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,260
Don't burn it!

204
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,680
Huh?

205
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:54,760
Huh?

206
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,620
Huh?

207
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
It's hot.

208
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,100
What's wrong with you?

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,200
Dad, Mom.

210
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,620
Ichiro!

211
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,040
What are you doing?

212
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,500
I was surprised because it was written in the newspaper that my funeral would be held.

213
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,640
Then, the one burning in here is...

214
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,700
I told you, the person in front is the one passing by the fire!

215
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,660
That's right...

216
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,140
Sushi! Sushi is here!

217
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,640
Your Highness!

218
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,560
Ryo-san!

219
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,640
Did you see what just happened?

220
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,740
What?

221
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,620
There was a sunfish here!

222
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,880
I couldn't see anything.

223
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,460
Is it just me?

224
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,260
Where is the sunfish?

225
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,760
It's Ryo-san!

226
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:37,300
Episode 8 "The Sudden Trap"

227
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,160
What's wrong? Why are you here?

228
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,460
Hey, BITE!

229
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,180
You're no good!

230
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,740
How could you just stand out like this?

231
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,740
How long have you been in the army?

232
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,180
Since 2004.

233
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,900
It's been 4 years.

234
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,880
What about you, Mooms?

235
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,460
You've been the leader of the new Goma-Kitteco.

236
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,300
I-I feel it!

237
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,260
This is the sign of crime!

238
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,640
The culprit is waiting for the prey in the haunted mansion.

239
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,260
It's pitch black.

240
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm scared.

241
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,560
Give me back my wallet!

242
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,640
It's real!

243
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,960
What's going on, Ryotsu?

244
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,180
Where is Higurashi?

245
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
I want to know!

246
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,120
I was inside, but...

247
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,140
There's no way out of the incinerator.

248
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,820
It's me.

249
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,160
Slipped at the amusement park?

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,400
Don't call me for that!

251
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,620
That's not what I'm here for.

252
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,940
Higurashi has disappeared.

253
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,180
What?

254
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,060
Higurashi is the one who caught Sli?

255
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,800
What?

256
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,380
Why is Higurashi in the haunted mansion?

257
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
Maybe it's a person.

258
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,740
Huh?

259
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,300
What?

260
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,640
I'm not scared.

261
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,220
You're just a child.

262
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,540
Right?

263
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,820
It's been a long time, Ryotsu Nakagawa!

264
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,020
You look too good!

265
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,100
I found you in this amusement park.

266
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,300
You were in the crematorium!

267
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,960
Huh?

268
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,100
Everyone's waiting.

269
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,740
Let's go back to the book.

270
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,580
Yeah.

271
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,600
Ah, Higurashi.

272
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,420
What's wrong?

273
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,900
Can't you just tell that this is the haunted mansion?

274
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,160
I can't believe you're in the crematorium.

275
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,600
Stop it!

276
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,600
Stop it!

277
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,460
Stop it!

278
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,520
Don't ever bring up that word!

279
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,900
Hinga.

280
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,000
Take her away.

281
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,200
Stop it!

282
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you really need this?

283
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,660
Man, what's going on?

284
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,580
The leader of the monbutsu!

285
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,800
Did you see that, Nakagawa?

286
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,040
Y-Yes...

287
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,100
A teleportation?

288
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
You're so stupid to say such nonsense!

289
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,100
I said it's true!

290
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,800
I saw it with my own eyes, too.

291
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,940
I still can't believe it.

292
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,780
He can only stay awake for 24 hours.

293
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,260
If we bring him back to his daily life as soon as possible,

294
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,580
this kind of incident is waiting for us.

295
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll call you back.

296
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, this is the exit.

297
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,740
Mr. Higurashi!

298
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,160
What?!

299
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,480
Where are you now?

300
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,600
Huh? Mr. Fujii?

301
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,180
Yeah.

302
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,900
When I woke up, I was here.

303
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,680
I happened to catch someone trying to take a nap,

304
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,180
so I caught him.

305
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Oh, I see.

306
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,900
I'll call you back right away.

307
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,740
Can't you come back from there in a flash?

308
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,640
Can't you come back from there in a flash?

309
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,200
A teleportation?

310
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,600
You didn't notice it yourself?

311
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
You've mastered the ability to teleport!

312
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,240
Huh?

313
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,160
You're right.

314
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
But I don't know how to do it.

315
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,320
I see.

316
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,200
That's what I'm talking about.

317
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,000
You go get him right away.

318
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
I got it.

319
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,780
Over there.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,380
Huh?

321
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,040
Thank you for helping.

322
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,760
It's a matter of course.

323
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,920
Well, I'll tell you when I'm back.

324
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,840
I'll wait for you with long hair.

325
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,580
I'll wait for you with long hair.

326
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,020
Hey, sir.

327
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Hey, sir.

328
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,540
What is it?

329
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,540
Can I have a moment with you?

330
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,520
To take a nap feels awkward.

331
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,800
Arrg!

332
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,020
Can't be helped.

333
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,260
Just this one.

334
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,460
Thanks.

335
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,100
Fire

336
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,620
What's wrong Higurashi-san?

337
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,380
The fire, the fire

338
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,500
The fire!

339
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,420
The fire, the fire, the fire

340
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,040
That reminds me, I saw the fire earlier

341
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
The fire!

342
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,700
Turn off the fire!

343
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,580
Did you make it?

344
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,780
I don't want fire!

345
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,020
Ryo-san, help me!

346
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh, it's gone.

347
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,100
Ah!

348
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,840
It moved again!

349
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,440
When it sees fire, it moves instantly.

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,320
First, the crematorium, then the fireball of the haunted house, and then the fire of the lighter.

351
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,620
I see.

352
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,260
So where is Higurashi now?

353
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,400
Where is he now?

354
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,260
Yes, the exit to the park.

355
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,780
Where is he now?

356
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,840
Kagoshima?

357
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,520
I can see the Sakurajima well.

358
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,540
I can see it erupt.

359
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,640
Erupt?

360
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,820
It's erupted. It's blowing fire.

361
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,860
Fire! Fire!

362
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,800
Don't look at the fire, Higurashi!

363
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,760
Ah!

364
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,120
Higurashi!

365
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,500
Hey, Higurashi!

366
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,800
Higurashi!

367
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,400
Answer me!

368
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Higurashi!

369
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,560
It moves instantly again!

370
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,440
Ah!

371
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes, the exit to the park.

372
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,820
Ah!

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,740
Higurashi!

374
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,000
Where is he now?

375
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,120
Ah!

376
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,140
What?

377
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,680
Hawaii?

378
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,500
Ryo-san, bring him here right away!

379
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,540
Don't say that!

380
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,240
Senpai, it's not far from my Concorde.

381
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,820
I'll be there soon.

382
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,700
Then, let's go!

383
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,340
I came all the way to Hawaii, but I can't see anything.

384
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,460
It can't be helped.

385
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,900
If you see fire, it will move instantly.

386
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,080
You can take it off.

387
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,360
Ryo-san, what is this?

388
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,860
It's an unsolved case file.

389
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,460
Do you see it here?

390
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,300
By the way, where do you see it?

391
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,920
Let me stand a little longer.

392
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,380
You only can get up for 24 hours!

393
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,300
Halfway through.

394
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,140
You don't have time to rest.

395
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,980
I see.

396
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,680
Wow!

397
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,300
We can see it!

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,560
It's the culprit of the 2 billion yen robbery.

399
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,940
Where are you?

400
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,840
I can see the river.

401
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,380
A river?

402
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,060
It's the Northern Senju.

403
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,580
Here!

404
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay, I'll contact Japan immediately!

405
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,540
Okay, I got it!

406
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,900
We'll arrest him with a $200,000 bribe!

407
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,680
Why did you find out here?

408
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,420
This guy is on the bullet train now.

409
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,260
He'll be arriving at Tokyo Station soon!

410
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,960
We'll arrest him now!

411
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,580
He's wearing a wig and glasses and working as a barber.

412
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,180
He's working at a convenience store near his house!

413
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,480
The culprit of this case is actually the oldest son of the house next door!

414
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,680
Oh, Higurashi. Welcome back.

415
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,240
Thank you for the food.

416
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,020
It's been a long time.

417
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,440
We'll be back soon.

418
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,760
You're still here? I'm hungry.

419
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,400
What are you talking about?

420
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,360
You can only stay up for 24 hours!

421
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,060
You can take a break.

422
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,620
Right.

423
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Nakagawa, go buy something.

424
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes, sir.

425
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,540
I guess we'll have to stay up.

426
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,980
Hey! What are you doing?

427
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,180
What did you say?

428
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,440
The cigarette.

429
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,380
Did you forget?

430
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,340
Higurashi can move at any time when he sees the fire!

431
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,900
O-Oh, I see...

432
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,280
My throat is dry, too.

433
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,420
Reiko, bring me some tea.

434
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,540
Yes, sir.

435
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,860
Wait a minute!

436
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,020
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

437
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,160
From this room, I can see the fire from the gas stove!

438
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,460
I see.

439
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,360
I'm sorry, Reiko.

440
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,040
Could you get us something to drink?

441
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,280
Yes, sir.

442
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,240
I'll be back in a minute.

443
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Excuse me.

444
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,600
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

445
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,240
I'll go.

446
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,260
You're starting the Athens Olympics today?

447
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,060
Yes.

448
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,020
The opening ceremony is about to begin.

449
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,060
I asked you to record a video of your "Friend Who Can Laugh" phone call.

450
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,200
I paid you for your part-time job.

451
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,820
I forgot about it.

452
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,060
I'll show you when I'm done with work.

453
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

454
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,580
I have to find someone who's recording.

455
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,480
What?

456
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
The opening ceremony is just around the corner.

457
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,300
What's wrong, Higurashi?

458
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,180
The fire! The fire! The fire!

459
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,960
The fire is finally on the fire station.

460
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,400
The fire! The fire!

461
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,980
The fire! The fire!

462
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,140
Ryotsu, can we go to Hawaii again?

463
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,200
Don't go!

464
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,140
It disappeared!

465
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
Damn it!

466
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
He liked the Olympics more than the three meals!

467
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,440
You don't have a call, do you, Higurashi?

468
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,040
It's almost 24 hours.

469
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,160
I have a little concern.

470
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,180
What is it?

471
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,600
Higurashi's teleportation.

472
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,080
First, he's in a nearby amusement park.

473
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,100
Next, he's in Mt. Fuji.

474
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,520
Next, he's in Kagoshima.

475
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,980
Next, he's in Hawaii.

476
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,740
He's getting farther and farther.

477
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,600
What?

478
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:45,880
That's it!

479
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,560
It's a bit late, but he's going to be here.

480
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,120
Well, it's related to the Olympics broadcast.

481
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,900
But here's some shocking news from the United States.

482
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,780
The subject of the event is this video from a Mars investigator.

483
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,980
It's about a scientific life form discovered on Mars.

484
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,980
It's about a scientific life form discovered on Mars.

485
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,900
It's a video from the Mars investigator.

486
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,740
What is this?

487
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,400
Higurashi!

488
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,860
Why on Mars?

489
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,020
Do humans live on Mars?

490
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,100
Maybe he awakened to a new ability.

491
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,860
I may have awakened to a new power.

492
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,040
There's something written on the ground.

493
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm sleepy.

494
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,300
So I sleep here.

495
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,120
Come to wake me up in four years.

496
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,300
Come to wake me up in four years.

497
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,200
How are you going to wake me up?

498
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,640
Don't worry about scandals anymore.

499
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,260
Cry and sleep. Play entonces.

500
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,640
You swirled it into the end of work report and threw it away.

501
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,280
There's no argument about it.

502
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,240
Be a fool.

503
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,760
You are good-natured and poor.

504
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,780
Am I?

505
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,740
If you want to do, do it in my way.

506
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,020

It's scary to look at nature in a sweet way.
