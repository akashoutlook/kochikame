"A Big Vagabond"

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,140
Well, I'll go first.

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,440
Tomorrow is the day off.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,380
I'm so happy!

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,560
What the heck is this?

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
I did it!

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,140
I got it!

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,740
Ryo has been captured!

39
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,100
I did it!

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,780
What the hell are you doing?

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,280
I don't have money.

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,340
I know that.

43
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,740
If you don't have money, I'll make it for you.

44
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,300
What?

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,480
Hey, where are you taking me?

46
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll write your profile here.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,340
Profile?

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,760
This is too expensive.

49
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm in danger, but I'm in a good condition.

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,640
It's okay to be a little dangerous.

51
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,360
Hey, don't decide it yourself.

52
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,900
I told you, the victim is here.

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,160
That's right. Ryo has no right to speak.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,180
If you have a special skill or a qualification, please register it.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
If I have a qualification, I have enough to sell.

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,380
First, I'm a dangerous person.

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,980
I'm a boiler repairman.

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,180
And then...

59
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,660
Please introduce me to a job that I can earn quickly.

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,640
Even if you say that, I don't have a qualification, a passion, a physical strength, or a special skill.

61
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,640
But pride is one in a million.

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,880
That's a problem, Shiratori-san.

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,260
Shiratori?

64
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,360
Chichi-chi.

65
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,280
If you take pride from this Shiratori Reiji, nothing will remain after you.

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
You're weak.

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,760
Anyway, you're suitable for me.

68
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,580
It's easy, gorgeous, and lively.

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,740
Please introduce me to a job that I can earn quickly.

70
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,140
Shiratori Reiji!

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,420
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,960
Hey!

73
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,680
Your father's company was crushed again because of this.

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,980
So, you came here to look for a job.

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,920
You're sharp.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
No, don't say something so rude.

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
This is a social tour of the Teyogaku.

78
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,820
It's just to spread the word as the next president of the Shiratori Iron Company.

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,540
Hahaha.

80
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,560
You're a poor man.

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,460
What?

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,120
What?

83
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,740
What?

84
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,840
A newspaper?

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,220
You finally ate up enough to not make a fake newspaper to spread the word?

86
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,200
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

87
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,060
Well, that's it.

88
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,080
Ryo-tsu-san.

89
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,980
Shiratori-san.

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,520
Ah?

91
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Ryo-tsu-san.

92
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,300
If you're a friend, could you please take care of Shiratori-san?

93
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,860
What?

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
That's not a joke!

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
No, that's fine.

96
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,040
I don't think Ryo-san is alone.

97
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,780
He's always hanging out with other people.

98
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,160
It's not like he knows what he's doing.

99
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh, you need a friend to see him off.

100
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,760
It's not a good idea to be with someone like him.

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,060
I can't stand being with this vulgar person.

102
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,100
Shiratori-san.

103
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,220
You can't do anything by yourself.

104
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
So don't say that.

105
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,560
What?

106
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,360
You're a loser.

107
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,340
To be honest.

108
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,380
You can't go anywhere by yourself.

109
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,380
I don't care.

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,340
I don't care.

111
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm with you.

112
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:41,860
Hey!

113
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,280
You're too quick to say anything, Shiratori.

114
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm the chief, so I'm going to help you.

115
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,580
Well, then.

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,340
It's decided.

117
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,740
Get!

118
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,680
Decided.

119
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,760
Hey!

120
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm not done!

121
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,740
Please take care of Ryo-tsu-san's family here.

122
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,480
Understood.

123
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,940
Don't decide it on your own!

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,680
Well, then, let's go!

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,700
What?

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,840
What are you doing?

127
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Well, this...

128
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,900
There's no one here.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Hey!

130
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,300
Let me do it!

131
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,900
I'm strong, but I'm not trying to win.

132
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,440
Why?

133
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,760
Oh, there.

134
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,080
His heart is in pain.

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,540
Try this!

136
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,220
You can do it, Shiratori-san!

137
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,620
I can't do it!

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,060
Masakopo is here!

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't bother me!

140
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,360
It's me, Masakopo!

141
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,740
Welcome! I'm the best in Japan!

142
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,060
I'm the best in Japan!

143
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,820
I'm the best in Japan!

144
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm the best in Japan!

145
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,500
I'm the best in Japan!

146
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
You idiot! The passers-by are running away!

147
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm the best in Japan!

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,420
I'm the best in Japan!

149
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,120
Take it, you poor thing!

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,420
Are you feeling better, Shiratori?

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,980
Yes.

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,840
Okay, now that you've calmed down, you can do whatever you want.

153
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,420
You're the one who's poor.

154
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,240
But what's wrong with this Kanmi Yomogi-jiru?

155
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,380
Ugh! It's bad!

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,040
What is this?

157
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,540
Shut up!

158
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,880
This is the new Kanmi Yomogi-jiru, the best-selling service.

159
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,800
Is this good? Isn't it a crime to give away something like this?

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,860
Hey! You can't do this without giving it to me!

161
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,640
Hey, did you drink this?

162
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,920
Of course!

163
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,020
It's really bad, right?

164
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,900
Yeah.

165
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,160
No, it's not!

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Just give me the Yomogi-jiru!

167
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,020
It doesn't matter if it's good or bad!

168
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,520
I'll give it to you without leaking, Shiratori!

169
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
But this tastes like a puddle.

170
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,800
It's not canned juice, it's canned.

171
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,100
A puddle.

172
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,940
Let's say that's the president.

173
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,460
Excellent!

174
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,020
I'm not the one to give away something like this to the world...

175
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,180
Hey! You still say that?

176
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,780
Hey! Don't you dare hit the head of a Yomogi doll!

177
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,780
What's wrong? Is there a problem with my Kanmi Yomogi-jiru?

178
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,300
No, there's no problem, president.

179
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
No, I'll tell you, but something bad is bad.

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,780
I was born to drink such bad things.

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,440
I've never heard of it.

182
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,640
What? Yomogi-jiru is bad?

183
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,500
No, it's bad.

184
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,040
This Yomogi-jiru is bad.

185
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,860
In other words, it's good, president.

186
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,820
That's right. As expected of the ambassador of the Koukoku.

187
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,580
He knows the true nature of young people.

188
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,940
No, he said that this Kanmi Yomogi-jiru is bad.

189
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
Hey, Shiratori, you!

190
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,880
What are you doing to Yomogi?

191
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,860
If you like it so much, you can drink it yourself!

192
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,400
President!

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,220
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,460
I can't force you!

195
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
You two, stop!

196
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,940
I've been bringing all kinds of luggage into the house.

197
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,760
If this is the case, I don't know how long it will take to get a asset...

198
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,060
Please pack your luggage, which you have downloaded from the container, efficiently, from the far end of the warehouse.

199
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,000
Any questions?

200
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,400
All right, sir!

201
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,300
Hey, aren't there any vouchers in Armania or Valencia?

202
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,700
Huh? Shiratori.

203
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,360
You're only @shiratori0 people, huh?

204
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,980
It's a treasure chest to lock it in such a moldy warehouse.

205
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,160
Eh?

206
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,320
No, it's nothing. I'll do it perfectly.

207
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,140
Really?

208
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,500
Then, nice to meet you.

209
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,300
What are you doing?

210
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,500
Listen, Shiratori! If you mess up this time, I won't know anymore!

211
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,520
You're with me, so you're doing the job.

212
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,800
I want you to be a little grateful.

213
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Gr-grateful?

214
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,820
Listen, if you ask someone who saw this situation now,

215
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,960
they would say "100 people are 100 people, and you're the one who's bothering them!"

216
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,660
I can't let you say that I'm bothering you.

217
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,240
You're a super rich me.

218
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm a super poor person now.

219
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,180
This super cool Shiratori, Reiji-sama,

220
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,680
is a super poor person and a little troublesome to you,

221
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,980
so people don't call it a bother.

222
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,780
Huh?

223
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,140
Because!

224
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,960
Because I'm Shiratori Reiji!

225
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,240
I can't do this anymore!

226
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,980
You're a sunbathing moron!

227
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,600
Unfortunately, the weather is bad, so I'm not a sunbathing moron.

228
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,200
Hey, get out of the way!

229
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,440
That's dangerous! That's dangerous!

230
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,680
That's dangerous!

231
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,580
Come on, come on!

232
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,440
Hey, stop!

233
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,520
Get out of the way!

234
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,060
That's dangerous!

235
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,140
Hey, get out of the way!

236
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,840
Hey, get out of the way!

237
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
There's no more space to assume!

238
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,240
If you don't line up, it'll collapse!

239
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,620
Stuff like that should stay under the roof and avoid any raincast!

240
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,980
If you stand up in a row, nobody notices!

241
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,900
Ahhh, I'm so delicate and so precious!

242
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,700
Because someone like this can't be helped!

243
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,640
My back is shaking and my trachea is aching.

244
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,700
Whether you're a whore or a spinster, stand up down,

245
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,340
why do I have to carry the burden of a Shiratori?

246
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,520
Well, if I'm aalarmy,

247
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not fair for someone else to do it.

248
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,280
Look over there. The box is different.

249
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,660
This box is slanted and it's about to collapse.

250
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,180
This box and this box are different types.

251
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,740
How's that?

252
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,000
My sense of balance that I've trained in games for years.

253
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,680
There's a big hole in the middle.

254
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,280
Look over here and there.

255
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,440
It's about to collapse.

256
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,600
This is how you do it.

257
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,260
Now it won't collapse.

258
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
It's going to collapse!

259
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,840
You guys, get ready!

260
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,180
I'm the only one who has been doing the country debt and taking a bath and eating and playing games.

261
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,300
Thanks to this guy.

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,620
I've always been bad at places like this.

263
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,940
I hated Shiso and Blanco.

264
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,280
Shut up.

265
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,920
Get up and get out of here.

266
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,600
Get out of here.

267
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,860
It's shaking.

268
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,500
It's shaking.

269
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,680
Hey, hey, hey.

270
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
It's dangerous.

271
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,960
Leave this kind of job to those who like expensive places.

272
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,960
We should have a job that's more like us.

273
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,620
Stop it.

274
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,220
You're mean.

275
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,280
You're not in a position to say you're luxurious.

276
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,340
Then I'll ask you.

277
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,100
What kind of job do you think you're good at?

278
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,720
That's...

279
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Rich, high-class, celebrity, gorgeous.

280
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,560
What are you doing?

281
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Enough.

282
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,140
You're not rich, high-class, celebrity, or maribu.

283
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,940
You can't get out of here until the window is blown.

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,420
Blow outside while you're dreaming, you idiot.

285
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Idiot.

286
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,540
Idiot?

287
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,260
Don't blow like that.

288
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,600
Don't blow like that.

289
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,480
Go straight.

290
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,520
You're in trouble twice.

291
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,180
I've never done anything like this before.

292
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,100
Hey, you.

293
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,840
Okay, fine.

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,980
Just sit there and move the gondola.

295
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,120
Should I push this?

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,420
I...

297
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,940
No!

298
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,540
It's high!

299
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,240
It's scary!

300
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,040
No!

301
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,700
You've already blown it up.

302
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,320
Push down.

303
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,020
Push down.

304
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,060
It's high.

305
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,880
It's scary.

306
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,260
It's high.

307
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,720
It's scary.

308
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,320
It's scary.

309
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,440
It's scary.

310
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,940
Then, do it slowly.

311
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,940
It's scary.

312
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,080
Idiot, you idiot.

313
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,280
This is not good.

314
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,700
Push.

315
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:29,780
Huh?

316
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,260
What?

317
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,440
It's strange.

318
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,380
Did it break?

319
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Move.

320
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,340
What?

321
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:41,740
What?

322
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,540
What?

323
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,900
What?

324
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,260
What?

325
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,580
What?

326
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,120
What is this?

327
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,160
Well?

328
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,380
I won't let you go.

329
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,800
I didn't know you were here.

330
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,120
Well, I'm not rich.

331
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,900
You're on one side.

332
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,620
You too?

333
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,560
The End

334
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,640
Hey, is this the job of a rich, high-class, celebrity and gorgeous?

335
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,100
Don't complain.

336
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,660
I got this job to meet your expectations.

337
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,220
If you don't want it, do you want to ride a gondola again?

338
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,160
Huh?

339
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,840
Do you want to ride a gondola and climb a high place?

340
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,440
You can also do a house tour, right?

341
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,220
That's...no.

342
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,220
Then work without complaining!

343
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,260
F-40, I was its owner until recently.

344
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,320
Huh?

345
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,280
It's the same as your car until it's modified into an automatic.

346
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,640
I miss those days.

347
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,400
Those days, the world belonged to me.

348
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Unfortunately, the world belongs to everyone now and then.

349
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,600
trouver

350
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,780
Hey, there's a guest like you in here.

351
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,960
Yes, sir and ladies!

352
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,240
This is what I've been waiting for!

353
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,620
Mr. 삼企部 九尺エステグループ出身

354
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,300
Mr. 九尺パトリック 三千代

355
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,460
Master!

356
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,300
You're obviously a fraud.

357
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,400
It's real!

358
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,160
Hey, Hirohudo Shiratari!

359
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,820
Stop it!

360
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,060
You don't have any pride!

361
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,700
What are you talking about?

362
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,760
You were just imitating me until recently.

363
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,100
Listen.

364
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,140
We are here to earn money.

365
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
We will give you your pride.

366
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,100
Give it to those crows!

367
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,940
Money! Money!

368
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
What?

369
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Where is my F40?

370
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:05,980
Yes.

371
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,960
It has been waiting for a long time.

372
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,020
I will give you the money.

373
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,500
Okay.

374
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,060
I will take your car here.

375
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,340
Ryo-tsu!

376
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,300
Yes!

377
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,680
What are you doing there?

378
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,120
Give me your F40.

379
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,300
Okay.

380
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,340
I am Ryo-tsu, who is in charge of F40 maintenance and inspection.

381
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm Igo Omishiri.

382
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,540
I am Gyo-Kyo!

383
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,800
Ryo-tsu!

384
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,140
Take this.

385
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,900
Bring me my car quickly!

386
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm back!

387
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,740
Earn money!

388
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,960
Shiratari!

389
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,340
My F40!

390
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,600
Hey, where are you going?

391
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,360
Bring it back quickly!

392
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,160
Yes!

393
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Shiratari!

394
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,420
Wait!

395
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,180
Wait, hey!

396
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,240
Hey, if you get hurt by a car, it's a problem! Get off the car!

397
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,140
No!

398
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,400
No? You don't have that right!

399
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,940
I'm not giving it to you!

400
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,300
It's not your car!

401
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,960
I don't want to!

402
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,400
What?

403
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,260
You must be hungry from your old self.

404
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,420
That has nothing to do with him or this F40!

405
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,000
Stop hitting him, Shiratori!

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,080
No, no, no!

407
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,200
My F40!

408
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,300
S-Shiratori!

409
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,520
My legs are touching yours, so don't leave me!

410
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,060
Don't follow me, you sick man!

411
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,260
That's a terrible thing to say.

412
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,240
Terrible?

413
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,760
It's like this.

414
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,040
I've always been rich, like you, who's always been poor.

415
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,680
But I'm like you, who's always been delicate.

416
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,380
In other words...

417
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,440
I have a different resistance to the mass violence in the world.

418
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,180
If I do that, my sense of justice...

419
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,760
Sense of justice?

420
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,620
Yeah.

421
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,560
Better not show off your shirakashita!

422
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,800
Ow ow ow ow ow ow!

423
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,580
Enough!

424
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,120
Don't bother me anymore!

425
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,740
I understand!

426
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,740
But you should need me!

427
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,020
What?

428
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,360
You are the only one who needs me.

429
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,660
You can't do it alone.

430
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,740
Even if I borrow your hand, I can live alone.

431
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,540
I have a job.

432
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:36,720
Hey, you!

433
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,360
What?

434
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,660
Don't be silly!

435
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,160
I can't even do such a simple job.

436
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I can't even do such a simple job.

437
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,880
I can't even do such a simple job.

438
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,560
You don't have to be depressed. Just watch.

439
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,580
Just as you told me, I did something to him.

440
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,160
Him?

441
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,800
It was like I was looking at myself from the past.

442
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,040
I couldn't stand it, and I was envious.

443
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,800
I was a foolish and immature duckling until now.

444
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,780
Shiratori.

445
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,600
You've become a good man when you're poor.

446
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,820
I'm a good man.

447
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,660
Actually, I'm just a plain, humble man.

448
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,820
Until now, I was just a descendant of Shiratori Tekko.

449
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,800
I was just trying to show my weakness to others.

450
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,520
Now I finally understand that.

451
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,900
That discovery has no effect on humanity.

452
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,960
But it's a big step for you.

453
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:47,980
That's right.

454
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,940
I did it.

455
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,940
Yes.

456
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
I guess I'll try to master this job.

457
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,740
It seems to be a job that can't be mastered or not.

458
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble up to now.

459
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,500
But I've changed.

460
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,540
Shiratori Reiji has died.

461
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,540
Please keep an eye on me.

462
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,260
Look at me.

463
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,460
Shiratori.

464
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,900
Ryotsu.

465
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,140
You're good.

466
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:42,320
So, did you return the debt?

467
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,640
Not yet.

468
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,200
But I've made many mistakes, and the debt has increased by tenfold.

469
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,020
What?

470
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,000
From now on, I'm going to work hard to pay it off.

471
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,020
Is that a salary you can work hard to pay off?

472
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,800
You're very calm, Ryo-san.

473
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,520
I can't change the money. I got something important.

474
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,460
You can't change the money?

475
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,240
Did you have that kind of thing?

476
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,280
Hey, you're being rude, Nakagawa.

477
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,300
You're a man, and you're a man.

478
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,600
A man's friendship is a treasure that can be used for anything.

479
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,480
A man and a man's friendship?

480
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,040
I'm sure you worked with Shiratori Reiji-san, right?

481
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,040
Does that mean that Shiratori-san and a man's friendship has developed?

482
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,640
What?

483
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,320
He's changed.

484
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,340
Listen, Reiko.

485
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,840
Don't judge a man by his looks.

486
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,480
There are some men who have a pure and humble soul under the white skin.

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,940
There are men like that.

488
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,480
There are men like that.

489
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
There are men like that.

490
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,020
No way.

491
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,500
Shiratori, what happened?

492
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,900
My father's company has been restored.

493
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,160
So I'm going back to living a rich and famous life.

494
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,400
What?

495
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,300
What?

496
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,300
Shiratori's company has invested a lot of money into the steel industry.

497
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,600
What?

498
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,740
I see.

499
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,320
Is that possible?

500
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,940
Hey, Reiko.

501
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,280
Please accept my love.

502
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,540
Oh.

503
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,800
How about a cruise on my yacht for the next holiday?

504
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
He hasn't changed at all.

505
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,280
Shiratori.

506
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,720
Shiratori Reiji is a man of character.

507
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,980
лег аlike a man of character!

508
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,260
Like a hero....

509
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,180
like a hero....

510
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,780
like a hero....

511
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,460
like a hero....

512
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,340
Some one calls me.

513
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,240
After a long rainy day.

514
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,080
Walking, looking back.

515
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,280
I walked home

516
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,440
My mom was holding my hand

517
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,300
That time I felt

518
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,780
A strange feeling

519
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
So

520
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,900
I tried to walk

521
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,720
On the black tile of the arcade

522
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:28,460
Everyone was a child once

523
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,060
But everyone forgot

524
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,480
The politician with a great face

525
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,040
And the blue lady above her eyes

526
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,740
Turn around and look

527
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,480
At that corner

528
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,080
You'll see everyone

529
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,820
There's a turtle over there

530
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,660
There must be a turtle

531
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,800
Everyone come to our town

532
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,700
Yeah!

533
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,680
Let's go!

534
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,000
There's a turtle over there

535
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,880
There must be a turtle

536
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,020
Everyone come to our town

537
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,000
Thank you!

538
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,920
What?

539
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm in a commercial?

540
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,620
Okay, leave it to me!

541
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,640
I see, I knew you'd watch it!

542
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,260
Listen, headmaster

543
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,000
Please look only at the good points of me

544
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,640
It's impossible!

545
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,420
And next,

546
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
HonestyDavid!

547
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm counting on you!

548
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,860
There's a turtle over there

549
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,780
There must be a turtle

550
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,680
Everyone come to our town

551
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,800
Thank you!
