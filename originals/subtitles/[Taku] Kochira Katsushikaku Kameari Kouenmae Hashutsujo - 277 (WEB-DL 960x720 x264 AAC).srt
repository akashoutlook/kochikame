1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,660
Seed

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,900
make the room a bit lighter and let's get away from each other

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,060
Necklace

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,560
That's what I'll say

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,780
That's what I'll say

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,980
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,780
I'm sure they'll be all right

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,820
Come to me if you don't have a job

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,720
I don't have one, but don't worry

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,760
Look, there's a burning dragonfly

12
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,040
I'm sure it'll be all right

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,360
You got it?

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,520
You got it, you got it!

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,820
If you got it, then keep quiet and follow me!

16
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,020
W-What's with the real thing?

17
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,480
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,380
Yes. On the day of the Hina Festival on March 3

19
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,160
We will make an actual Hina doll and display it at a nearby cats' park

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,040
I see

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,800
The picture will be broadcast on TV all over the country

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,000
It will become a huge image of the cats' park

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,780
But if we want to make a set of the human size

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,320
It will take a lot of work

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,580
Don't worry, O-Hara-kun

26
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,920
I have one in my book.

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,560
Oh?

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,120
A man who is only useful at this time.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
"Hina Sanzan's Birthday"

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,560
What?

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,340
You want me to hold a Hina festival?

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,360
On March 3rd?

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,040
It's the director's order.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,660
You're good at this, aren't you?

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
There's a TV broadcast, too.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,340
You have to do it well.

37
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,880
Wait, director.

38
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,580
I can't hold it for March 3rd.

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,140
This is the director's order.

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,600
And he said he would allow other tasks.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,540
Then at least make the Hina festival on March 2nd.

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,680
It doesn't matter if it's on the 4th.

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,700
What do you mean?

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,520
The Hina festival has been decided on March 3rd.

45
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,940
Director!

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,980
If you fail and embarrass the whole country,

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,100
you won't get a bonus.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:10,880
Hello!

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:25,520
Ryo-chan.

50
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,360
Senior.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,160
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

52
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,600
You don't want to make Hina dolls?

53
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,240
No, I don't, Tenai-san.

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,400
If it's March 3rd...

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
What?

56
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,060
March 3rd.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,220
If you say that, it's something.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,280
It seems...

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,240
It's my birthday.

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,060
Oh, I see. Ryo-san, March 3rd was your birthday, right?

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,320
You were born on the day of the Hina festival, right?

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,120
On the day of the girls!

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,380
Shut up!

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,260
By the way, I don't remember having a good day on my birthday.

65
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,200
For some reason, I have a sad day every year.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,280
I was mistaken for a mobile unit and was put together with a hellish Moutoku.

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,760
Before I knew it, I was taken to the North Pole and fought against a Shirokuba.

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,800
And there was a time when a tank came down from the sky!

69
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,800
March 3rd is the biggest holiday for me.

70
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,780
You're right.

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,860
I thought I'd sleep at home for a day so that nothing would happen this time.

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
I can't refuse the order from the director.

73
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,660
You're so selfish.

74
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,180
What's that?

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,060
Hmm?

76
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,220
Oh, Ryo and Kanchi!

77
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,060
You're acting like a bad guy again, aren't you?

78
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,200
No, it's the director's order.

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,660
I heard you're going to make a doll for the Hina festival.

80
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,800
Yeah, I'll ask you to help me.

81
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,520
But you have a bad jinx on March 3rd.

82
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,060
Yeah, so I'm going to finish it by March 2nd and take a day off.

83
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
It's a good chance to be on TV.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,180
Too bad.

85
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm sorry, but I'll watch it on TV at home.

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm going to die.

87
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
Ryo, you too!

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,660
Ryo, you too!

89
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,360
Senpai!

90
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,180
Ryo!

91
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,400
Are you okay?

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,140
Ah, it's nothing serious.

93
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,700
I'm so glad.

94
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,300
But you're not even cold.

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,220
No way.

96
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,320
No way.

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,040
No?

98
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:45,620
No, it's just-

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:45,900
What should I do?

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,020
I'm scared.

101
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,780
It was someone's fault.

102
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,260
Bwahahahaha!

104
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,340
That hurt!

106
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,340
Hey!

107
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,980
Ouch!

108
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,420
Ouch!

109
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,220
Aaaaaaah!

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,620
What, I'm stuck.

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,200
What are you doing?

112
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Huh? The power's out?

113
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,900
Yuzu!

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,940
Senpai!

115
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,900
You! Are you trying to kill me?!

116
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,220
The End

117
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,580
Senpai! You're hurt!

118
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,180
Ryo-chan!

119
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,720
It's just a bruise.

120
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,900
The misfortune that should have come on the 3rd of March is coming at me.

121
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,080
No way...

122
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,880
Can you think of anything else?!

123
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,360
You're just standing there with your eyes closed!

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,580
Seki! Seki!

125
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,740
What's with you?!

126
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,060
Yuzuka!

127
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,280
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

128
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,620
It's gonna sting! It's gonna sting!

129
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,840
Senpai!

130
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,020
You're right.

131
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,980
It's a series of bruises.

132
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
Poor thing...

133
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,760
How about we have you pay for it?

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
That's right! Let's have you pay for it!

135
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,180
We have a good reputation for having a great arm!

136
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,220
That priest of mine is sitting next to us.

137
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,160
Yeah...

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,580
I see...

139
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,200
Paying for it, huh...

140
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,680
Huh?!

141
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,540
Mie?!

142
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,900
You know the cause of my misfortune?

143
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,980
Huh?!

144
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,180
The cause of your misfortune on the 3rd of March.

145
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,900
It's all because of the cursed doll!

146
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
Cursed doll...

147
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,400
You mean the cursed doll?!

148
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,600
You! You must have done something terrible to a Hina doll in the past!

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,380
Hmm... I have... I don't have...

150
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,200
Ah! That's right, you have!

151
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,980
That was when I was still in elementary school.

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,880
I went to a place where the same class girls were having a Hina festival...

153
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,340
...and challenged a Hina doll in the GI Hall.

154
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,220
I had my opponent annihilated.

155
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,680
There's no doubt about that.

156
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,540
-That's right. -I knew it!

157
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,400
The Hina doll, who suffered a terrible blow, resented that...

158
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,440
...and took revenge on you on March 3.

159
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,560
This year, you have forgotten about the old blow...

160
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,540
...and are trying to make a Hina doll. That's why they're angry.

161
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,380
You know that?

162
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
The Tōnins said so.

163
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,140
Hey, do something!

164
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,580
Don't be so flustered! I'm a professional! Leave it to me!

165
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,980
Oh, how was it? Did you finish the cleaning?

166
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,060
Yeah, it was perfect.

167
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,940
I think so, but...

168
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,980
I don't know yet. I don't want to see the work actually resumed.

169
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,060
Let's start!

170
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,260
Huh?

171
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,340
Let's knock on this guy first.

172
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,620
Oh! I got 500 yen!

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,400
Hey! You're lucky, Ryōtsu!

174
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,320
You got paid well, didn't you?

175
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
No, I don't know yet.

176
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,280
Something terrible might happen after this.

177
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,040
It's empty.

178
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,900
Oh!

179
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,860
It's Hercules the Hedgehog!

180
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,180
Wow!

181
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,840
I don't have money!

182
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,460
I got some, Ryōtsu!

183
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,140
No, you haven't.

184
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,660
Look at this!

185
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,480
It's for you!

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,360
Just for you.

187
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,240
This is the Tiger戦車 you sent me!

188
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,880
So, I got the price for a magazine I sent you now!

189
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,120
Wow, there you are!

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,920
Yeah!

191
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
Did you do your cleaning?

192
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,320
I guess so.

193
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,560
That's right!

194
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,700
That's great.

195
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,040
Yay! Yay!

196
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,580
And with that, we bid farewell to the 3rd of March!

197
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,860
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

198
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,680
There's nothing else I've read about you.

199
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,760
I'd like you two to host the festival of the real things.

200
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,700
Eh?

201
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,740
Us?

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,980
You two represent our school.

203
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,920
Please join us.

204
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Please, I beg you.

205
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
I don't mind, but...

206
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,300
Me neither.

207
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,380
I see.

208
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,080
Well then, let's get dressed.

209
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,200
Wait a minute.

210
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
What is it, Reiko?

211
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
I have a suggestion.

212
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,860
A suggestion?

213
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,600
I think it's around here.

214
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,060
Ah, there it is.

215
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,980
I have to use real sake for my rice wine.

216
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,060
What?

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,720
You're giving the rice wine to the director?

218
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,480
Hm?

219
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,600
Yes, he's the most important person in this festival.

220
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,140
Hmm, but I don't know if the world will approve of him as the director.

221
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,000
The 3rd of March is my senior's birthday.

222
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,220
So if I give him a birthday present...

223
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,100
That's right.

224
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,180
Everyone will approve.

225
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,700
I'd like to do the same.

226
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,020
Please, President.

227
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,220
Hmm.

228
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Got it.

229
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,860
If you're going to say that, then I'll do it.

230
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,260
Thank you very much.

231
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,780
I'm sure Ryo-chan will be happy.

232
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,980
Me being the director?

233
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,680
Not bad.

234
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,900
Huh?

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
That's right.

236
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,460
Why don't you keep this a secret from Ryo-chan?

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,740
That's right.

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,120
Let's announce it the day after and surprise her.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,700
Hehehe.

240
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,240
As soon as I finished the cleaning, I got lucky.

241
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,820
Hehehe.

242
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,040
I was

243
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,380
What's that?

244
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,460
It's not a bad idea.

245
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,280
I was impressed by the way it was made.

246
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,980
It's good.

247
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,500
Trash.

248
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
You're looking for girls?

249
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,700
Yeah.

250
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,280
It seems that you are making a doll.

251
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,200
Boys!

252
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,620
I will measure the size, so come!

253
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,420
Yeah!

254
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,020
Yes!

255
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,480
Hmm. Finally, my agent's costume.

256
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,460
Yes Yes!

257
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,160
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

258
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,960
What?

259
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
What does that mean?

260
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,220
Hello, I'm from the TV station.

261
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,120
I said that I would like to make a doll as a woman as possible.

262
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,300
The five-person forest is a man!

263
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,040
I said to make it a woman.

264
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
What about the minister and the minister?

265
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,860
I also said to make it a woman.

266
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Anyway, it's a request to make everyone a woman.

267
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,180
What is that?

268
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,180
What does that mean?

269
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,380
The minister should have decided with me.

270
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,660
Then why did you call us?

271
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,420
That's right!

272
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,960
I called you because I thought you would be sorry if you didn't appear on TV at all.

273
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,680
How?

274
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,840
This is...

275
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,960
You have to paint your face three colors.

276
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,420
Ah, ah, ah!

277
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Pea flower.

278
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,980
Daidai.

279
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,600
What is this?

280
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,480
You want me to show my womanly appearance to the whole of Japan?

281
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,720
That's too much!

282
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,960
Oh, you're so noisy.

283
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,260
I got it.

284
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Then, I'll make you a five-person forest.

285
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,300
It hasn't changed at all, right?

286
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,180
Then,

287
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,880
If it's the gold industry, there's no problem, right?

288
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
It's not that kind of problem!

289
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
I can't talk.

290
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,220
Can you go out with me?

291
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,700
I'll go home.

292
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,900
You're so mean.

293
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,860
What? I thought I'd show you on TV.

294
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,420
It's okay. Let's do it alone.

295
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,540
There's one thing I want to confirm.

296
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,760
What is it?

297
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,740
The minister is actually a man, right?

298
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,000
You know?

299
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,600
I knew it.

300
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,780
The minister decided it beforehand.

301
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,520
That's right. I should have decided it.

302
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,340
That's what I wanted to confirm.

303
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,540
See you later.

304
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,200
What's wrong with him?

305
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
All right! All right!

306
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,280
I think it's a really wonderful firework.

307
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,060
Thank you, Ryo-chan.

308
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
For making such a wonderful firework.

309
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,320
What? What?

310
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,400
What?

311
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,300
As a secretary of the Katsushika office,

312
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,220
I did the obvious.

313
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,320
We'll rehearse in 10 minutes.

314
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,000
I repeat.

315
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,040
The rehearsal will be in 10 minutes.

316
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,440
Well, now...

317
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Oh, it's refreshing.

318
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,280
If you want to go to the bathroom at the top,

319
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,820
you can do it.

320
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,540
What's wrong with you guys?

321
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,000
You're pathetic, Ryotsu.

322
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,460
You're such a male secretary,

323
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,560
but you're asking a woman to help you.

324
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:40,780
What are you talking about?

325
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,580
You're not like the usual seniors.

326
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,440
That's right.

327
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,320
That's right.

328
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,200
What are you going to do?

329
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,500
It depends on the situation.

330
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
I don't get it.

331
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,880
Huh?

332
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,660
What?

333
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,820
What's wrong?

334
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,900
What do you mean?

335
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,400
We are angry.

336
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,700
You traitor.

337
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,360
Don't misunderstand.

338
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm also upset about their attempt.

339
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,380
But think about it.

340
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,220
Even if the law and the system are reformed,

341
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,720
Japan is still a male society.

342
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,440
There's no place for women to play an active role.

343
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,460
What?

344
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,640
The day when women can play the leading role in Japan.

345
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,400
That's the day of the Hina festival.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
It's not a big deal.

347
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,440
We just decorate the Hina dolls and add Hina Arale and Amazake.

348
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,660
I think it's okay to make their faces on such a day.

349
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,520
Ryotsu.

350
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,040
You've thought that far.

351
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,120
As a man, it's a matter of course.

352
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,100
5 minutes before rehearsal.

353
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:43,980
No.

354
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
This is not the time to do this.

355
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,300
Sir.

356
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,700
Are you there?

357
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,560
Sir.

358
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,300
I'm sorry I'm late.

359
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm changing.

360
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,260
You have to.

361
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,100
What do you mean?

362
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,460
Why?

363
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,640
It's natural for Nakagawa to be the clerk.

364
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,460
He is the most suitable for the clerk in the Katsushika prefecture.

365
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,140
I should have been the clerk.

366
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,240
Eh?

367
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,720
Is it a joke?

368
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,460
If he can make you the clerk,

369
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,100
he needs to leave you alone.

370
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,060
doesn't he?

371
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,300
Don't mess with me.

372
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,780
3 nurses, please get to your seats.

373
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,220
Okay.

374
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,300
I'll get you.

375
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,360
I knew I would be your clerk.

376
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,680
I've had enough of you.

377
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,100
I will crush you.

378
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,180
I'll get it!

379
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, Ryo-chan, where are you going?

380
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm going back to the office. The show is tomorrow.

381
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,160
That's right. You'll be surprised at the show.

382
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,780
That's right. I didn't expect you to be the assistant.

383
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,840
What are you guys doing here?

384
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,620
What do you mean?

385
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,300
I'm going to put flowers on the festival tomorrow.

386
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm making flower of peach.

387
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,720
Don't make such a thing!

388
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,800
You guys are so stupid for making the festival.

389
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,980
Aren't you frustrated?

390
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,880
But...

391
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,260
You said you were going to make a girl's set tomorrow.

392
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,360
That's a general story.

393
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,000
Look at my girls.

394
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,000
They are always making a big face.

395
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,080
We boys are having a narrow view.

396
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,420
Do we have to make a face now?

397
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,460
Tell me, Bull.

398
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,060
If you say it's a festival, they will be more and more stupid.

399
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,680
It's a festival, so we have to be smart and smart.

400
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,240
Is there any way?

401
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
I have an idea.

402
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,660
Tell me.

403
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,420
First of all, they are making flowers.

404
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,160
What?

405
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,340
Are you sending it?

406
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,900
What?

407
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,840
It's very difficult to make such a thing for the festival.

408
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,940
But this is a festival that I came here today.

409
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,100
That's a small show.

410
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,960
I say, a festival the big has to be together with other festivals.

411
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,020
But now you're cutting it into two.

412
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm inside.

413
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,540
You?

414
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,900
What's wrong?

415
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
N-nothing.

416
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,320
I-I thought he hadn't come yet.

417
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,340
The priest is looking for him right now.

418
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,620
The broadcast is about to start.

419
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,660
Are you ready?

420
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,380
Yes!

421
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,680
Listen up, everyone!

422
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,140
The women in the neighborhood are too good-natured!

423
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,240
It's one of the reasons why men have become weak!

424
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,440
We just need to show them the strength of a man around here!

425
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,280
And then, we'll destroy the women's festival, the Hina Festival, in this manor!

426
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,020
Yes!

427
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,360
Okay! I, the chief of the Kirikomi, will report to the teacher!

428
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,080
You guys wait here!

429
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes!

430
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,860
It seems like he's not in the book.

431
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,420
I searched all over the place, but...

432
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,700
Huh?

433
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,120
Where did he go, Senpai?

434
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,080
He's in trouble. The broadcast is about to start soon.

435
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,060
I-I knew it!

436
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,180
It's Nakagawa-san, just like during the rehearsal!

437
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,460
There he is! It's Ryo-chan!

438
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,200
Eh?

439
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,540
Senpai!

440
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,840
Tch!

441
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,640
Hey, you guys!

442
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,460
Ryo-chan! I've been looking for you!

443
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,160
Eh?

444
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,040
Senpai!

445
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Happy birthday!

446
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,340
W-what's this?

447
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
It's Senpai's birthday today.

448
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
I was just about to celebrate with you.

449
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,360
Is that so?

450
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,300
And then, this is a birthday present from everyone.

451
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,960
It's the costume of the chief.

452
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,300
It's exactly the size of Senpai.

453
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,740
So I'm the chief?

454
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm sorry for not telling you.

455
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
I thought I'd surprise you a bit.

456
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,860
Y-you guys...

457
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,140
Thank you! I've never been this excited before!

458
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,500
Broadcast 10 minutes ago!

459
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,860
Now, hurry up and change!

460
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,500
Because I'm the chief today!

461
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,380
Ryo-chan, you're back in time.

462
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,040
What are you doing?

463
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Here.

464
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,220
What's wrong?

465
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,220
Ryo-chan is really becoming a big boss!

466
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,260
What?

467
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,840
Ryo-chan, you betrayed us!

468
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,620
Ryo-chan, you betrayed us!

469
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,160
We're going to get married!

470
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,900
Ryo and his betrayal will be put to death by the Hina Festival!

471
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,160
What?

472
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,460
Ryo-chan, you will get on well!

473
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,600
Re-so-perfect.

474
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,380
Broadcasting 10 minutes now!

475
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,040
3, 2...

476
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,000
In this Katsushika garden,

477
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,500
a lady from the Katsushika branch shows us a real-life Hina.

478
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,920
She prays for the safety of the children's transportation,

479
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,420
We wish you a safe trip.

480
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,500
Your costumes and the Hinadan are also made by the people around you.

481
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,420
It's wonderful.

482
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm curious about Ryotsu.

483
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,620
Of course, the guests and the Hinadan are also made by the Katsushika...

484
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,320
What?

485
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,620
What's that?

486
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,240
Doki doki doki!

487
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,020
It's a men's Hinamatsuri!

488
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,740
What is that?

489
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,260
Oh no! I totally forgot about them!

490
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,540
They're coming this way!

491
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,840
Wait, Ojaru!

492
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,820
Get ready!

493
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,900
Wait! I can tell if you let me go!

494
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,000
Men's Hinamatsuri!

495
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,920
Get ready!

496
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,560
What is this?

497
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,940
My head!

498
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,500
Oh, director!

499
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,420
I defeated you!

500
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,980
You're really良ling!

501
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,120
Not only do I want to fight, but I don't know who will take me down.

502
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
Youсеll.

503
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,600
That's right.

504
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,940
What's special about you?

505
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,240
I have more strength than Minato!

506
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,380
I will protect you!

507
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,900
I will protect you!

508
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,260
You often talk about it.

509
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,280
What's wrong with youse, Minato?

510
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,380
Stop it, yousse!

511
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,480
Me?

512
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,060
What?

513
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,200
I hate March3rd so much!

514
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,100
Ryo-san's "Why?"

515
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,140
Ryo-san's eyebrows look like black ants, why?

516
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,760
Why?

517
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,600
He wears sandals but he runs really fast, why?

518
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,280
Why?

519
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,480
Ryo-san always has his arms around his head, why?

520
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,080
Why?

521
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,820
He's so fast but he's so popular, why?

522
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,040
Why?

523
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,180
It doesn't matter but

524
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,600
The anime title is so long

525
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,100
Katsushikaku Kameyari Kouenmai, first release

526
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,440
Why?

527
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,200
Why?

528
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,620
Why?

529
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,680
Why?

530
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,060
Why?

531
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,820
Why?

532
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,380
Why?

533
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,700
Why?

534
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,080
Why?

535
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,740
Why?

536
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,160
Why?

537
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,240
Why?

538
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:32,020
Who the hell are you?

539
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,220
You're the same as me, right?

540
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,320
Did I become a part of you two?

541
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,300
But I don't know who's who

542
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,840
Do you understand?

543
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,740
I became Ryo-A from now on

544
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,120
And you became Ryo-B

545
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,940
Next time, Ryo-an and Ryo-A

546
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,060
Let's split up!

547
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,080
Next time, Ryo-A and Ryo-a

548
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,820
Thanks for watching to the end!

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,920
