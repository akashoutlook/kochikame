00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,580
Murakami Museum

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,420
When TV is on, warm the room and stand away!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to me, you people, who have no money.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,860
I do, too, but I worry.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,620
I'm worried about you

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,900
White clouds

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
I wonder what will happen

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,500
When the sun goes down

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,840
Come to me if you don't have a job

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't have one, but I'm worried

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,420
Look, it's burning

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,160
Red

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,400
Red clouds

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,160
I wonder what will happen

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,500
I know, I know, I know

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know, just follow me

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,940
Get out of there!

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,700
Thief!

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:56,160
Thief!

22
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,860
Thief!

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,000
Stop it!

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,140
Thief!

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,780
Episode 2

26
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,540
Another of those scumbags.

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,660
This is the eighth case this week, right?

28
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,380
And they're still in the office.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,060
I think we're incompetent.

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
They already think so.

31
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,940
What's the criminal going to do with the photos of the victims?

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I think it's a bad habit.

33
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,100
Speaking of habits, Ryo, did you go get the thing the chief asked you to?

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,860
Huh? Oh, I forgot.

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,260
Please be careful, and be nice to Ohara-san.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,480
I feel like the chief is paying 300,000 for something like this.

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,400
Thank you very much.

38
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,280
I'm hungry.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,060
Then I won't eat beef.

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,040
I'll have to wait until tomorrow, Friday.

41
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,700
It's seven.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,940
If I put this in seven...

43
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,200
No, I can't! This is the chief's precious...

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,300
But I can't change the flowers.

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,820
No, that's not good.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,920
Because this is the chief's...

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,060
The chief won't die until tomorrow, will he?

48
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,660
I see.

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,580
Hmm.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,280
So, how much are you going to lend me?

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,060
10,000 yen.

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,700
That's about 10,000 yen.

53
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,200
10,000 yen?

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,380
This is the white thing that has been worth 300,000 yen in that store until now.

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,200
You're doing a good job.

56
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,900
I can only lend you 10,000 yen.

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,600
If you don't like that, let's quit.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,580
You're so stubborn.

59
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,500
But if I have 10,000 yen, I can eat grilled meat.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,340
I'll borrow 10,000 yen to eat grilled meat.

61
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll get paid tomorrow.

62
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,240
When that happens, I'll give you the money and take this.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,060
The day after tomorrow, when the chief returns from his trip,

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,120
I'll give you a

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,420
Wait! Thief!

66
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,020
This is bad! I'm in the picture right now!

67
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,980
Wait!

68
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,520
It's the next round!

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,780
The受賞者緊張役会

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,220
There won't be another left turn.

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,520
I won't let you get away.

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,180
the受賞者緊張役会

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm counting on you.

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,540
Three, two, one, go!

75
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,380
The car was wiped out in a flash.

76
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,140
I can't let this happen.

77
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,020
Wait.

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,460
The car was wiped out in a flash.

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,560
The car was wiped out in a flash.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
You can take me with you.

81
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,300
We have the head of the investigation department.

82
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,760
It's just a matter of time before we catch the culprit.

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
We need to get that picture back before the chief sees it.

84
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,820
The scene of the attack was in front of you.

85
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,340
Ryo, what were you doing?

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,260
I was patrolling, no matter what you think.

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,420
Ryo, you went to get the kakejiku that the chief asked you to, didn't you?

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,720
What about the kakejiku?

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,640
The kakejiku?

90
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,380
What?

91
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,060
You didn't put the chief's kakejiku in the sieve, did you?

92
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,500
It was on holiday.

93
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,500
The store was closed and I couldn't go get it.

94
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,200
And it was late at night on the way home, so I thought it might be something to dig up.

95
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,720
I just took a peek.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,120
I see, I see.

97
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm relieved.

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,420
That's right.

99
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,580
It's a robbery to put someone's things in the sieve.

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,100
I wouldn't do that.

101
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm going to look for the kakejiku.

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,500
So bad!

103
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,600
What?

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
It was open until just now.

105
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,900
Give me the kakejiku back.

106
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:20,980
Please.

107
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,720
Hey!

108
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,160
Hey!

109
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll take the kakejiku back tomorrow.

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,180
It's a picture.

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,760
I have to get that picture back.

112
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,120
If you don't give me your own kakejiku, I'm going to eat you properly.

113
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,440
It was just on holiday.

114
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm coming back.

115
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,540
To be safe, you have to thank me.

116
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,200
That something happened to that store's kakejiku,

117
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,780
It was a fraud.

118
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,500
Oh, I see.

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm going to take that into consideration.

120
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,440
I was wondering where the kakejiku was.

121
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,620
That's right.

122
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,640
He's here! Don't let him escape!

123
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,840
Leave it to me.

124
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
There were two of them.

125
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,420
Yes.

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
They disappeared.

127
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,320
Damn it! Again!

128
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,100
I'll take care of the rest. Let's go, Honda!

129
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,440
Roger that.

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
What should we do, boss?

131
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,940
Honda! Follow that trailer!

132
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,960
Roger that.

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,500
Roger that.

134
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,200
Roger that.

135
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,920
Wait until I call you.

136
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,260
Wait until I call you.

137
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Mr. Furioso!

138
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,700
All right, I won't let you escape!

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:31,960
All right, I won't let you escape!

140
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,940
I finally arrived at the base.

141
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,020
I finally arrived at the base.

142
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,280
Well, the boss is a rough man.

143
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,620
Mr. Furioso!

144
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,740
Mr. Furioso!

145
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,260
I don't think they will let me go.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,240
I hope they don't let me go.

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,040
I hope they don't let me go.

148
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,600
Boss, new employees?

149
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm counting on you.

150
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,340
Me?

151
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,280
You're not like me.

152
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,020
Bingo!

153
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,820
Alright.

154
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,400
...

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
...

156
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,560
...

157
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,200
...

158
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,760
...

159
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,240
Where are those two?

160
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,880
Sorry!

161
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,400
Ah, you're a new employee, right?

162
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,280
This is the conference room.

163
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
No, that's...

164
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,920
...

165
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,200
This is the sales performance of the past 6 months.

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,860
...

167
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,520
...

168
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,780
...

169
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,640
Oh well.

170
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,260
Hm?

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,880
In this way, Hittakurika's

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,120
...

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,280
...

174
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,540
...

175
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,020
The results of the half year are in the process of processing.

176
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,200
Is it a trick?

177
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,640
Along with the promotion, it is becoming the luggage of my thief company.

178
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,580
Thief company?

179
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,460
That's all. At this rate, the March financial settlement and the June financial resolution will be canceled.

180
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,000
Thief...

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,180
You even put out a sign.

182
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,020
You put them out as hard as you can...

183
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,960
It's gonna be late soon so you should try to work harder.

184
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,620
Yes!

185
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,560
It's them!

186
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,380
Sir, where is the report of today'sезation?

187
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,420
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,320
Hm? I haven't seen it.

189
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,420
It's a group from today. Thank you for your kind cooperation.

190
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,860
Ah, right. Have you visited often.

191
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,640
I want to borrow your cat's hand too. I'm looking forward to it.

192
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,280
Yes, let's do our best together.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,780
Thank you.

194
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,160
Thank you, everyone.

195
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,380
You have to stop wearing uniform until the first button.

196
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,660
And our job is to run away.

197
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Go to the general assembly later and get the shoes for the beauty.

198
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,900
No, I have this sandal as a trademark.

199
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,060
No, no.

200
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,940
I want you to do something that will disturb the atmosphere of the company.

201
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,040
You're disturbing the atmosphere of society.

202
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,540
Did you say something?

203
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,720
No, nothing.

204
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,460
I have a question.

205
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,080
You all take pictures of the work site, right?

206
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,240
Why?

207
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,720
This is a proof photo that I did it.

208
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,620
This document is used as reference.

209
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,980
I will make a calculation of the salary.

210
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Salary?

211
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,100
You're a thief, but you're paid?

212
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,780
This is a company.

213
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,320
You, take this as a proof.

214
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,060
Yes.

215
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,580
That's not all.

216
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,720
Two bonuses a year.

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Employee trip.

218
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,880
I'm proud of my company's hardworking student.

219
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,600
It's like an ordinary company.

220
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,320
Thief company.

221
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,700
If you make this company a big deal, it's not a dream to raise the bonus.

222
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,440
I'll do my best.

223
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,580
By the way, Chief, what do you specialize in?

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,560
I'm a fraudster inbrewed in flowers.

225
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,520
I knew it.

226
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,200
Let's do our best.

227
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,200
Yeah.

228
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,520
You can't tell me your godfathers made you rend it to aって .

229
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,960
Oh, right.

231
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,520
This is...

232
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't call me like that.

233
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm glad you're okay, senpai.

234
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,380
I was worried.

235
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,920
Where are you now?

236
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,080
I stepped into a terrible place.

237
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,760
What? I can't hear you well.

239
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,920
Drone Co. Co. Trade?

240
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,360
It's close, but it's not.

241
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,200
Anyway, wait.

242
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,840
I'll contact you if you use the specific movements of the people.

243
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,720
While checking the enemy position, I have to take that picture back.

244
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,020
Kirikawa...

245
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,960
Hey, did you hear?

246
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,680
The president of Akisuka is moving out.

247
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,980
No way!

248
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,860
The police of the marriage fraud is also retiring within a year.

249
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Shou!

250
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,500
I was aiming for it.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,460
Is Izuko also the same landscape?

252
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,980
Oh, here!

253
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah, there he is!

254
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,100
The practice for the new person is going to start, so hurry up.

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,820
Practice?

256
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,380
100 yen, 200 yen...

257
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,980
If you count the three, four, and the small, you can ask the owner of the soba restaurant for a time.

258
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,820
What time is it now?

259
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,680
Then the owner of the shop...

260
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,980
It's five o'clock.

261
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,060
Six, seven...

262
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,480
Hey!

263
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,460
Nice to meet you!

264
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,340
The secret trick to earning 100 yen in a bid.

265
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,800
Oh!

266
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh!

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,560
Great!

268
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,280
What's the secret?

269
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,880
It's Rakugo's Tokisoba.

270
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,240
Even kids these days don't get caught with such a thing.

271
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,980
What did you say?

272
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,240
I was surprised.

273
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,980
I didn't notice at all.

274
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,360
Hide.

275
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
I can't see your stomach.

276
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,320
Pull it in.

277
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,260
OK.

278
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,480
Next is this.

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,300
Butt.

280
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,540
If you can't hide anywhere,

281
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,060
our company's employees won't work.

282
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,360
Stomach.

283
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
Next is this.

284
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,020
Butt.

285
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,780
I can do it!

286
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,860
OK.

287
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,120
It's done.

288
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,380
What's with this old-fashioned look?

289
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,360
It's the uniform of our company's night shift workers.

290
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
I'm glad to see you're back.

291
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,320
Let's go.

292
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,600
Hello, Senpai.

293
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,340
Hello?

294
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,400
Where are you going?

295
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,800
Let's start with the new employee.

296
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,060
Just follow me.

297
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,380
Don't worry.

298
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,560
We'll find the way out soon.

299
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,080
If we don't get good results,

300
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,420
If we don't raise the price, we'll be in trouble.

301
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,500
The company's management is also very strict.

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,160
I have a question.

303
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh!

304
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,860
What?

305
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,640
If you're a thief...

306
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,140
Huh?

307
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,720
I can hear you. Speak loudly.

308
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,400
If you're a thief, you should work alone to earn money.

309
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:37,980
What?

310
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,620
Why do you work in a company?

311
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,540
The more middle-class thieves like us live,

312
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,740
the more this industry is not sweet.

313
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,980
The world is a mess lately.

314
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,520
We have to live together like us.

315
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,440
You can't eat alone, so you joined our company, right?

316
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,620
No, it's just a rust from the body.

317
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,200
Shinjin, if you stay here and there's a suspicious person,

318
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
let us know.

319
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay.

320
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm the suspicious one.

321
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,920
Let the siren ring and let's go.

322
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,440
Come to the third warehouse.

323
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,540
You don't have to let the main army know?

324
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,700
It's still early.

325
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,060
When you catch it, you'll be in trouble.

326
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,400
How is it?

327
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,580
A little more...

328
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Hurry up.

329
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,840
No, it's like the latest Jomae.

330
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
Emergency call! Emergency call!

331
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,060
What?

332
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,960
A suspicious person is wandering around the truck.

333
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,060
What should I do?

334
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,140
I got it. I'm going right away.

335
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,080
If you see him, take him out.

336
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,220
What's this?

337
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,660
Five or six people with sunglasses and a black man in black clothes suddenly...

338
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,060
What?

339
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,760
I'm sure they're from the Gouto Co., Ltd.

340
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,360
Is there such a thing?

341
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,680
I can't do this.

342
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,820
I'll get back to normal soon.

343
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,900
What's wrong with this?

344
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,020
Sorry?

345
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,980
I thought we were a small company.

346
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,580
We have few employees.

347
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,180
Sometimes we're hired to help.

348
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,080
Don't say useless things.

349
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,800
Carry it on.

350
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,380
Shinji, you go with me.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,420
What?

352
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,640
Honda.

353
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,440
Not yet?

354
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,840
Get out of my way.

355
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,060
It's a patrol car.

356
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,840
It's a white horse.

357
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,660
I can't help it.

358
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm going back to the car.

359
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
Shinji, carry the rice.

360
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,620
He runs fast.

361
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,540
He's a good guy.

362
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,840
Today's result is zero.

363
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,140
Idiot!

364
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,400
He left the car on the scene.

365
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,700
It's not a waste.

366
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,980
The police wouldn't have done it anyway.

367
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
Try to keep the current law.

368
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,140
Come on, change the law.

369
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,680
If I move this, I can't eat anymore.

370
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,080
That's a shame.

371
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,600
I can't give my month's pay today.

372
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,180
It's a bomus topic.

373
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,800
The company trips are all dreams.

374
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,900
I'm sure this is it.

375
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,400
If we can't hit a big mountain with this.

376
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
We're all gonna end up in the sun.

377
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,640
I have something to tell you.

378
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,620
A big project that I've been working on is in progress.

379
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,680
Senior!

380
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,540
What? That's so reckless.

381
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:26,820
That's so reckless.

382
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,840
There's a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief.

383
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,520
I'll catch him in the second half.

384
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,100
This is a chance.

385
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,800
Hey!

386
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,760
Hey, you!

387
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,780
If you know what's going on, I'll follow you and contact you.

388
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,880
Hello, Ryo.

389
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,160
I'm in trouble.

390
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,340
It's too cool to go into the enemy alone.

391
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,660
It's better to call the headquarters.

392
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,500
The underground tunnel to the Kameari Bank is complete.

393
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,580
Yes, I'm ready.

394
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,120
But...

395
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:56,940
What's wrong?

396
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,300
The security is getting more and more strict.

397
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,360
It's better to postpone the next period and wait for the fire to cool.

398
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,700
If you say such a reckless thing, my company will be disbanded.

399
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,680
Should I do it or not?

400
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,360
Let's do it!

401
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,520
Hey!

402
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
We should definitely do it.

403
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,140
Let's make this project a success so that all the employees of the company can get through the March deadline.

404
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,900
What are you talking about?

405
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,900
This is not the place for newcomers.

406
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,380
That's right.

407
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,840
I want to pay for today's failure.

408
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm ready to go to the party.

409
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,400
I'm ready to go to the party.

410
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm ready to go to the party.

411
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,620
That's also fine.

412
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,260
But...

413
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,620
At the end, we have to be passionate about our work.

414
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,060
We have to have passion.

415
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,600
We have to have a feeling of going forward.

416
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,800
And the hopes of all the employees.

417
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,340
The company we love is life.

418
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,800
A difficult job is the path we should take.

419
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,780
Well, that's great.

420
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,720
Hey, Tokisoba.

421
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,700
Let's make this a success.

422
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,820
President.

423
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,620
Okay.

424
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,540
That's great.

425
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,240
I'll contact you later.

426
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,660
Before that...

427
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,220
I brought you the deadline.

428
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
But there's no one here.

429
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,580
I'm sorry.

430
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,580
Um...

431
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,980
The report...

432
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
The report...

433
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,800
If I can get this, I'll take this one.

434
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,920
What are you doing?

435
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,780
I brought you the deadline.

436
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,900
You're a newbie.

437
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
You brought me the deadline.

438
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,660
Anyway, it's work.

439
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,720
You should get ready.

440
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,920
Night shift?

441
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,300
Excuse me.

442
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,380
Excuse me!

443
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,780
A maintenance team

444
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,280
One staff member

445
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,380
We have a cash

446
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,120
for rent.

447
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,280
All the employees are here, President.

448
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,360
Yes.

449
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,400
It's a job we've been doing since we started being peak employees.

450
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,320
I hope you won't get injured.

451
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,480
Please, be good.

452
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,580
Good luck.

453
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,120
We must do it well.

454
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,400
It's not like a endureance.

455
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,140
I didn't even know you're going to do something to me.

456
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,000
Eh, what?

457
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,940
Huh? Huh? Huh?

458
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,720
I can't contact you without a cell phone.

459
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,640
If I can't contact you, I'll be a thief's enemy.

460
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,060
But why am I the first to run away?

461
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,580
Good luck, newcomer.

462
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,920
All right, this is what real work is!

463
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,600
Go straight, go straight, go down the path you believe in.

464
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,780
Okay, my head is spinning.

465
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,640
Ouch!

466
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Why is there a wall here?

467
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,180
All right, here we are.

468
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:55,820
What?

469
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,160
It's a bank that faces diagonally.

470
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,680
Then you don't have to dig this out.

471
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,880
You can just walk.

472
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,180
I finally fell down to where I was going to fall.

473
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,580
Oh, my God!

474
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,100
It's a bank!

475
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,440
Who is it?

476
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,100
Huh?

477
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,920
I did it, Mr. President!

478
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,960
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,660
It's the Bank!

480
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,020
It's the Bank!

481
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,460
It's the Bank!

482
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,900
In this case, I'll take care of them all by myself.

483
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,040
All right!

484
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,320
What?

485
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,560
Be a fool!

486
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,320
Y ocho!

487
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,720
Are you okay, Ryotsu?

488
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,940
Hey, sir! Welcome back!

489
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,420
I'm not worried about this life. I can't use it for hot springs.

490
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,260
But I understand this place.

491
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,320
The headquarters also grasped the existence of the people, but they were trying to measure the timing of the arrest.

492
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,180
Thanks to Ryotsu, I was able to solve the early problem unexpectedly. I was happy.

493
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,780
That's good. Senpai, I respect you. You're amazing, Senpai.

494
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,020
I don't like to act alone, but this time it's a good thing.

495
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,020
I'm proud of you, Ryotsu.

496
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,620
I feel uncomfortable when I'm praised by the chief.

497
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,960
Senpai, something fell.

498
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,160
What?

499
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,860
It's a photo.

500
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,280
This is the kakenjiku I bought. Why is it in the mirror? Why is Ryotsu receiving the money?

501
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,000
Explain, Ryotsu!

502
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,820
You idiot!

503
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,260

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,480
