" kayak " Smoke

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,580
some sun that floats in the river If

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,080
you throw away your love stone, you can fly to the world

4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,480
From the water tank of the Tongari hat

5
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,160
To the taishakuten, the sun is falling

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,420
Tomorrow will end like this

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,180
"Katsushika, Shibamata, I'm so happy!"

8
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,080
I realized it after losing it

9
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,480
Because I'm so stupid

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,100
Re-emerging Shiratori Reiji

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,260
It's finally noon. I'm hungry.

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,300
Takaga, I'll order a set meal from Tsurukame.

13
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm sorry. I'm a lunch box, so it's okay.

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,040
Awesome!

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,700
So, Reiko?

16
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm a lunch box, too.

17
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,280
Ryo, why don't you eat something different?

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,080
Something different?

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,440
I only have two more soba noodles left.

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,880
If you don't eat more nutritious food,

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,700
you'll get sick every day.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,040
Leave it to me.

23
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,460
I'm hungry.

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Akaro, come on!

25
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,000
It doesn't hurt, does it?

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,640
"W hotspring"

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,480
This car is so dirty.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,380
I'll go to the Warriors.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
How can I drive like this?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,100
No way.

31
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
You've got to be kidding me?

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,060
That's because he's a tercer.

33
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,620
You're so stupid.

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,080
Well, I knew it.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,560
You're a loser.

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,140
That's why I'm so scared.

37
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,300
New Special Episode

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,160
It's been so long, poor people.

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,680
Leave it alone.

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,380
Let go!

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,140
It's Shiratori Reiji.

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
Did you forget?

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,520
I almost forgot about it.

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,080
It's not possible that he was super poor.

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,220
Right.

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,900
Why is he riding a Ferrari?

47
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,160
Shiratori R nails his son

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm sure you're not impressed by me, are you?

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,480
Did you cry because of me?

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,620
Shut up!

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
You're like a little child.

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,540
Anyway, I, Shiratori Reiji, will be back to help the super rich!

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,780
Pick it up, you poor guy!

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,500
I'll take all the coins!

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,780
What's this? It's a toy!

56
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,900
The super rich only carry cards.

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,960
Damn it!

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm glad I was able to drive without making this happen.

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,340
You suddenly became a rich and became an idiot?

60
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,680
Stop, you poor super rich!

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,800
I got a bullet!

62
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,700
Oh, I got caught again!

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,220
Damn it! I'll pick it up with the condition reflection when I look at the screen!

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,380
Listen, don't be surprised!

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,480
Look!

66
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,640
It's an automatic!

67
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,460
And a right-hand drive!

68
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,420
I see, this is a replica based on a Japanese car, right?

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,340
No, this body and paint are real no matter what you look at it.

70
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,980
Then, did you modify it on purpose?

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,200
You shouldn't have done that on purpose.

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,200
The manufacturer specially modified it for me.

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,780
No matter what the road is, I'm not afraid of anything.

74
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,500
That's why Japanese people can be seen with their white eyes from abroad.

75
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,720
That's right.

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,280
Look at this!

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
What a luxury car!

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,240
It's a wide-angle pole!

79
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,280
What is this?

80
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,400
You don't know?

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,620
You see, high-end cars often have high-end cars.

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,160
This pole is a point, and it's a mark to keep the car at a distance.

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,700
Normally, it's attached to a sedan car.

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,660
Sports cars are always useless.

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,940
Shut up!

86
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,160
You're the only one in the world who has this on an F40.

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,460
It's fine, right?

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,460
I'm embarrassed, so take it off!

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,920
It's not a good look at all!

90
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,780
It's not a good look at all!

91
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,900
Idiot!

92
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Sports cars are really cool!

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,880
That's the most important thing!

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,980
Now we can run to the edge of the earth.

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,060
Reiko, let's go on a date.

96
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,820
Are you done with your work?

97
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,880
Not yet.

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,440
Then why don't we have dinner together?

99
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,400
You're a stubborn man.

100
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,780
I saw you the other day.

101
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,000
You're ridiculous!

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm the owner of the Akimoto Trade Company!

103
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,680
I made a reservation for a new restaurant in Odaiba.

104
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,120
The chef there will let me eat the best French food.

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
That's fine.

106
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,380
I'm glad you're so happy.

107
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm happy, too.

108
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,280
I told you I didn't want to!

109
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
If you want to eat, bring me with you.

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,060
I'm starving.

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,360
You have no time for this.

112
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Why don't you have some ramen to go with it?

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,760
I can't order ramen like that!

114
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,420
Oh, no!

115
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,280
Damn it.

116
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,500
I hate waiting for my turn.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,860
Come on, go out with her, Reiko.

118
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm hungry.

119
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,200
I want to eat French food.

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,600
I want to eat French food.

121
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,020
If you're with me, that's fine.

122
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll do it!

123
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,620
But how do you get in?

124
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,060
It's a two-seater car.

125
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,580
How can three people get in?

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,180
Then let's go.

127
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
Why are you crouching?

128
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,980
It's bad to sit in a place like that.

129
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,620
It's an automatic, but it's a Ferrari.

130
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:04,760
It's a Ferrari.

131
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,040
Reiko, I'll go straight to Odaiba.

132
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,380
Ferrari is quick.

133
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,320
It's the latest carnavi sold by Shiratori Ironworks.

134
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,740
There's no way to get in the ironworks business.

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,340
If you do a lot of things, you'll get crushed.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,760
Shut up!

137
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,940
Where should we set the destination?

138
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,380
What do you think?

139
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,360
Surprised?

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,980
It's not unusual.

141
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,760
It's on Nakagawa's car.

142
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,220
You talk in various voices.

143
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,420
It's the same as Kei's.

144
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,500
You're just thinking of ideas.

145
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Your company.

146
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,980
Shut up!

147
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,620
Our carnavi is different from the carnavi of the village.

148
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,760
The version that has been approved is set on.

149
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,880
Master, where should we set the destination?

150
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,640
Go to Odaiba.

151
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,640
It's Odaiba.

152
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,780
I understand, Master.

153
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,960
I understand, Master.

154
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,760
It's the latest carnavi with AI and voice recognition.

155
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,900
It's a revolutionary carnavi.

156
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,080
I see.

157
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,260
It's not much different from Kei's.

158
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,400
Really?

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,580
Why is the traffic jam here?

160
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,200
Shut up!

161
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,580
Do something.

162
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,820
Yes, Master.

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,640
Avoid traffic jams.

164
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,900
Turn left at the next intersection.

165
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,720
He's driving!

166
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,620
It's dangerous, damn it.

167
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,140
Stop here!

168
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,860
It's the carnavi's instruction.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,160
It must be a shortcut.

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,960
It must be a shortcut.

171
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,920
This road must be.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
I think so.

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,860
He said so.

174
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,300
The proud carnavi couldn't search the roadі.

175
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,220
Go back and go to another road.

176
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,440
No!

177
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,880
The road is blocked.

178
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,580
I'm not good at back-hitting, so I'll follow the navigation.

179
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,600
What? Stop it!

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,240
We're in trouble!

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,080
How's that? Did you get through?

182
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,260
Don't be so mean!

183
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,460
Turn right at the next corner, sir.

184
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,060
It's still rubbing! Rubbing!

185
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Move to the left!

186
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
It's rubbing this way!

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
That's why I hate the lower bus!

188
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,860
Don't blame the lower bus for your poor driving!

189
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,760
Don't blame the lower bus for your poor driving!

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,480
Sir, you can go straight ahead.

191
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,820
Hey, why don't you take the highway?

192
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,640
There's an entrance.

193
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,260
Really?

194
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm sure there's an entrance to a closer road.

195
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,380
Our carnavigas can't go the wrong way.

196
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,000
Liar!

197
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,340
You told me to avoid the highway because you were afraid of it.

198
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,180
Rascal!

199
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,700
So you're going to go down the hill?

200
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,100
It'll take a lot of time to get there.

201
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,120
Really?

202
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,160
That's strange.

203
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Did we break the carnavigas?

204
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,400
We did a self-diagnosis test, but there's nothing wrong with it.

205
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,620
Rascal...

206
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,300
Hey, it's a highway!

207
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,420
Get in the highway!

208
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,140
Hey, do you hear that?

209
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
What's that? It's not responding!

210
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,340
That's right.

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
It's set to recognize only the owner's voice.

212
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,880
Then you give the order!

213
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,220
That's right!

214
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,780
What?

215
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,100
Hm?

216
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,020
I'm going to change the route setting to go to Odaiba by the main street.

217
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,060
Is it the main highway?

218
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,880
That's right.

219
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Is that okay?

220
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
What's wrong?

221
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,780
The user usage level is in beginner mode.

222
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,300
It's set not to use the highway, but is it okay to change it?

223
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,020
Don't ask me that every day!

224
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,000
Huh?

225
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,840
Everyone, do you have a license?

226
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,860
Give it a try!

227
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,620
I have private license.

228
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,920
The road that goes to the main street is about 200m from here.

229
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,620
100m more.

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,420
Hey, are you really okay?

231
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
He's wearing too much color.

232
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,700
What if he's never used the highway before?

233
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,760
Hahaha, I'm fine.

234
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,860
I have a driving lesson by the school of automobiles.

235
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,800
Ringo!

236
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,600
You can't do that!

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,100
This is no good!

238
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,560
You're too slow!

239
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,940
We did it! We made it to the highway safely!

240
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,180
Poor car in the back.

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,080
Really?

242
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,500
500 meters to Shibaura Junction.

243
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,060
Enter Odaiba Line at the end of the line.

244
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,020
Please change lanes.

245
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,060
200 meters to Shibaura Junction.

246
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
Please change lanes.

247
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,700
Don't say that so suddenly!

248
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,720
I didn't say it suddenly.

249
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,920
I've been telling you many times.

250
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,460
Please change lanes now!

251
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
But there's a truck behind us.

252
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,420
100 meters to go.

253
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,780
Please change lanes now.

254
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,860
Shut up! I know!

255
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,640
Hurry up, Master.

256
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,000
Damn it!

257
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm sorry!

258
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,480
What the hell?

259
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,640
We passed the exit.

260
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,100
Are you going to kill me?

261
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,480
You can go anywhere.

262
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,200
You should take the highway.

263
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,660
Oh, yeah.

264
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,040
I want to go to the highway.

265
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,240
I'm sorry!

266
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,840
Get out of the way! I'll drive!

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,380
Oh, no! No!

268
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,240
Wait, Ryo!

269
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,700
You're in danger!

270
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,920
It's much more dangerous to let him drive!

271
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,940
What?

272
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,520
You bastard!

273
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
You bastard!

274
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,680
You bastard!

275
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,300
You bastard!

276
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,660
Ryo, you're in danger!

277
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,440
You bastard!

278
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,640
You bastard!

279
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,840
You bastard!

280
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,080
You bastard!

281
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,640
You bastard!

282
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:52,700
You bastard!

283
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,960
You bastard!

284
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,360
You bastard!

285
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,940
Where are we?

286
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,740
Where are we?

287
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,640
The primary school will have a minibus.

288
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,300
Why are there many people of the countryside?

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,820
It's because you broke the car navigation system.

290
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,280
You shouldn't blame others for it.

291
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,120
But you guys should be fine.

292
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,080
It will take a while.

293
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,680
Is that a restaurant?

294
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,680
No, it's a restaurant.

295
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm fine with a ramen shop.

296
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,140
Don't you have a lot of sheets?

297
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
I don't have a car navigation system.

298
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,880
That's a problem.

299
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,060
The screen is shaking.

300
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm afraid the sun is coming down.

301
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,180
Can you run more quietly?

302
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,600
It's better to have a video camera.

303
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Go to the left.

304
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,460
What?

305
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,840
Why are you going to the right?

306
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,520
Can you do that so suddenly?

307
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm not good at it.

308
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,240
Then you drive.

309
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
Which way is the next?

310
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,700
I don't know.

311
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,500
You're pathetic.

312
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,760
Shut up.

313
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,660
I'm not as delicate as you are.

314
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,500
That's perfect.

315
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,240
Then I'll go.

316
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,060
This is fun.

317
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,820
It's not a reenactment game.

318
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
Ryo, are you okay?

319
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm fine.

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,220
I'm fine.

321
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,220
This isn't what I want.

322
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,820
I'm not going to be

323
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,380
I was a Ferrari.

324
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:46,260
Defeat that car.

325
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,960
Be more careful!

326
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,800
Ryo, slow down a little!

327
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,180
The car's gonna break!

328
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,860
Ouch!

329
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,060
I'll follow your orders!

330
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,560
The battery's out!

331
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,640
Huh?

332
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,640
You don't have a spare battery or a CIGAR connector?

333
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,340
I don't have any!

334
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,300
You should have a spare battery!

335
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,580
You're a bad guy!

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,660
You know?

337
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,400
I don't know anything without a car.

338
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,680
Where should I go?

339
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,720
I'm going to the gas station!

340
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,520
Huh?

341
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
The engine's not broken.

342
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,940
It's just the gas.

343
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,720
I should have eaten French food at the station long ago.

344
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,100
I was just returning to the station.

345
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,020
You're the reason why this happened.

346
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,420
Something bad happened.

347
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,240
What?

348
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,380
It's your fault!

349
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,820
You're such a poor guy!

350
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm a poor driver!

351
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,660
You two, stop!

352
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,200
Calm down.

353
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,900
It's no use fighting over a place like this.

354
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,580
Yeah.

355
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,020
I'm so angry that I'm getting hungry.

356
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,380
You're in trouble.

357
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,480
R-Reiko, don't worry.

358
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll call the police.

359
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,080
Oh, it's me.

360
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,260
Huh?

361
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,080
Who are you?

362
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
Don't you know me?

363
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm Shiratori Reiji!

364
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,960
Shiratori Tekko's Shiratori!

365
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,980
The gas has run out and I've stopped by.

366
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,940
Can you come over?

367
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,080
Huh?

368
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,540
Where?

369
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,400
Where is this place?

370
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,260
You don't know?

371
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
If you know, you have no trouble.

372
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,760
I don't know where it is.

373
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,060
Anyway, please help me.

374
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,640
Hey, you!

375
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,780
Shiratori Tekko's Shiratori Reiji!

376
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,360
This stupid guy!

377
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,340
You're so stupid.

378
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,340
Damn it!

379
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,380
Anyway, I have to get gas.

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,260
I don't think there's any gas here.

381
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,760
I can see it.

382
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,700
I don't think this kind of shop fits super rich people like me,

383
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,280
I don't think this kind of shop fits super rich people like me,

384
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,760
so I'll just go in.

385
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,860
Hello.

386
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,360
Oh, there's a bunch of stuff here.

387
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,340
Excuse me.

388
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,820
Is someone here?

389
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,400
Okay, hold on a second.

390
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,320
Look at that watermelon!

391
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,920
Oh, and some snacks!

392
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,260
That's a poor man's food.

393
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,740
Yum!

394
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,960
You're not going to eat it?

395
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,680
I can't eat such a cheap thing.

396
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,300
You're a good man.

397
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,300
Welcome.

398
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,220
Excuse me.

399
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,800
If you have any gas,

400
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,560
I'd like to share some with you.

401
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,820
Well, well.

402
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,400
Where are you from?

403
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,020
I'm from Tokyo.

404
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,520
That's a long way to go.

405
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,580
Good job.

406
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
Grandma, this and this.

407
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,060
Yes, yes.

408
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,480
All of them cost 145 yen.

409
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,620
Thank you.

410
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,240
So, what do you want?

411
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,940
Gasoline.

412
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,800
Do you have it?

413
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,500
Yes, yes.

414
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,220
Gasoline.

415
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
That's 25 yen.

416
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
I'll take this.

417
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,220
What's this?

418
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,340
It's a card.

419
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,280
You don't even know what a credit card is?

420
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,740
I've been paying cash since I was a child.

421
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,780
Here you go.

422
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,360
Damn it.

423
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,900
You threw it away.

424
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,180
How about this?

425
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,400
It's a Super Gold Million Card.

426
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,300
You can buy a house with it.

427
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,840
You're so boring.

428
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,580
Give me the cash now.

429
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,580
I'm a super rich man.

430
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,080
So I don't carry cash with me.

431
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,620
What?

432
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,080
You said you ate the stuff at the store

433
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,240
because you didn't have money?

434
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,160
I told you I'd pay with a card.

435
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,720
Grandpa,

436
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,700
call the police station.

437
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,240
They'll eat you.

438
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,860
Hold on.

439
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,860
Super rich man can't win

440
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,720
even if he has 25 yen.

441
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,780
I'll pay for this, Grandma.

442
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,040
I'll pay for this, Grandma.

443
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,820
Really?

444
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,500
That's fine.

445
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,020
But it's not good to date a rich man like him.

446
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,380
You're right.

447
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,860
Grandma,

448
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,720
do you have a smaller TV than this?

449
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,500
I only have this one.

450
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,600
Reiko,

451
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,720
buy me this, too.

452
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,820
What are you going to do with a TV?

453
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
I'll connect it to the navigation.

454
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,860
Give me the money back to Shiratoru later.

455
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,260
I haven't sold a TV in a long time.

456
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,180
And I hope you have gas.

457
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,160
Gas?

458
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,800
Gasoline.

459
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,680
Grandpa,

460
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,940
do you have gas?

461
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
Gasoline.

462
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,260
I don't have gas.

463
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,700
I only have gasoline.

464
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,780
Then we'll only use diesel.

465
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,920
Are you sure you're going to drive like this?

466
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,500
If you don't drive like this,

467
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll just walk.

468
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,200
Aren't you a little too big?

469
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,140
I can only see half of you.

470
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,980
Don't complain.

471
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,740
Start the engine.

472
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,500
Ferrari!

473
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,560
Navigation system on.

474
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,600
Good morning.

475
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,600
Where are you going today?

476
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Turn off the sound.

477
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,420
Idiot!

478
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,040
Why are you going into the middle of the mountain again?

479
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm fine here.

480
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,840
I can't help it.

481
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,820
Then go here.

482
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,360
No, I said I should go as it is.

483
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,840
No, I don't know how far you can go in this state.

484
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,340
It's better to run a little farther than in the mountains.

485
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,540
That's true.

486
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,100
No, I just thought so.

487
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,100
Good mood.

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
It's a forest road over there.

489
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,400
I know.

490
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,860
It's not right, it's left.

491
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,500
What are you doing?

492
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Stop it, Ryo.

493
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,680
You made a mistake.

494
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,520
I'm sure he hasn't left yet.

495
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,980
You should have just called me.

496
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,740
I heard that you trusted his driving.

497
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,200
Reiko, let me give you a car.

498
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,660
What?

499
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,660
Driver, come here.

500
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,580
This is my favorite shop.

501
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,300
Hello.

502
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,720
Welcome, young master Shiratori.

503
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,160
I was going to have you buy the car I bought last week.

504
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,040
Are you going to buy it?

505
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,380
I'm a super rich man.

506
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,020
Rich people change their minds quickly.

507
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,140
I'm sorry.

508
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,040
Be careful how you listen to me.

509
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,080
Look for a car that suits her.

510
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,320
It's her.

511
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,000
What do you think of this?

512
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,140
How much is this?

513
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,440
Including the cost of execution, it's about 290 million yen.

514
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,300
Two million?

515
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,180
I don't like red.

516
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,820
Is that so?

517
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
It's pretty good color.

518
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,160
Hey, don't touch it without permission.

519
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,660
You don't know the manners?

520
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm a regular here, so I'm in the showroom.

521
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,000
It used to be a roadside market.

522
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,160
Do you know that?

523
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,680
It's full of luxury cars, so I'm surprised that I can touch it so easily.

524
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,760
And you guys just have a typewriter.

525
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,500
It's a kid in the field.

526
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,660
Master.

527
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,200
Good thing I happened to make you sit in my car.

528
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,860
Uh-huh.

529
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,300
That's a little alec.

530
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,320
Hey.

531
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,040
Do

532
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,540
I know this guy?

533
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,560
No.

534
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,520
All right.

535
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
Let me call the roadside market stage.

536
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,640
You knew each other at McLaren F1?

537
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,680
No, no.

538
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,920
This McLaren F1 is a new car.

539
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,200
Please take a look.

540
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,800
I was thinking I wanted one for the parts.

541
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,420
This is a good one.

542
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,540
Hey! You can see it thanks to me!

543
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
Don't talk to the owner directly!

544
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,200
Huh?

545
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,240
The owner doesn't have to talk to me and him, does he?

546
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,060
Hey, Reiji!

547
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,480
Dad!

548
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,820
I didn't know you were here.

549
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,300
It's a coincidence.

550
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,720
I was showing the super poor guy a luxury car.

551
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,000
Hey, you guys!

552
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,800
Gie, gie, gie, gie, gie!

553
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,540
You idiot!

554
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm the toy of Nakagawa Concern!

555
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm not your father!

556
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,040
I'm sorry to have insulted you.

557
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,880
I'm not your father.

558
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,640
I'm not your father.

559
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,520
I'm the company of Nakagawa Concern!

560
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,080
Dad!

561
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,500
You idiot!

562
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,280
Are you showing the super poor guy a luxury car?

563
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,040
Let go of my hand.

564
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm...

565
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,680
Super rich man!

566
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,420
Oh, my!

567
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,120
I knew this was the best.

568
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,880
I've never seen French food before.

569
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,160
Well, Siratori was...

570
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,940
You're too kind!

571
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,780
No, I was selfish.

572
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,980
What have you to say?

573
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Hello, everyone!

574
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,140
Hello, everyone!

575
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,320
You are...

576
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,200
Yet again moved,

577
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,980
and you've come back to the super poor guy.

578
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,500
Huh?

579
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,260
Ah...ah...ah....

580
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,080
Shake!

581
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,400
You sure are a pretty easy person to be.

582
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,780
No way, I never knew I'd become married.

583
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
Nariuuki, you surprised me too.

584
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,420
Ryo-sama is my χ Tiger.

585
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,140
Heheh.

586
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,100
I'm excited.

587
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,940
Next time on Ryo's and Minda's Entire Love.

588
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,400
Take care!
