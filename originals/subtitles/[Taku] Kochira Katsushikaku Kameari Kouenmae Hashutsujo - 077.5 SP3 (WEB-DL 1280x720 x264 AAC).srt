1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,740
Golden hair, fierce! Spring is fierce!

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,200
Here is Katsushikaku Toadjack Arhurator

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,300
Mass production power full-scale special

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,500
The most dangerous survival

5
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:51,000
Subtitles by Subdivers - Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Detective Nakagawa, no

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,120
Now we can go overseas for training together.

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,300
What?

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,120
Now we will complete the boys' club.

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,980
Wait a minute!

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,740
Get out of my way!

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,560
Mr. Ryo!

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,500
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,420
Chief, you are so mean!

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,520
Why didn't you tell me that I have the shooting test?

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,220
It's useless to teach the guy who has been absent for 10 years.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,660
The winner and the runner-up have the advantage to go overseas for training.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,540
Do you think you can go overseas for training?

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,280
Of course.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
What's so funny?

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,320
You don't have to train, but you can't win the top position.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
You are just making an excuse.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,800
Stop it.

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,520
I'm not kidding.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,000
I always get the best score in the shooting test at the game center.

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,160
Idiot!

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,840
Don't do the same as the game.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,620
Anyway,

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,300
I can't give you the lowest score.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,320
Go home now.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,560
I'll definitely go out.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,460
No, you can't.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,200
I will.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,400
You can't.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
I will.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,760
You can't.

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,160
You can't.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,880
You can't.

40
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,320
Mr. Ohara, it's fine.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,520
Let Ryo shoot.

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,680
But…

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
It's a good chance to know how important the shooting training is.

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,820
If I get the lowest score, I won't leave you alone.

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,220
Don't worry.

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,560
Chief Kan-kichi Ryo will go.

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,260
I will.

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Good luck.

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,360
What?

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,580
What does he do?

51
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,140
You sure?

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,000
I am also a hearing man.

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,660
Good luck.

54
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,320
Excuse me who's shooting?

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,840
I'll shoot.

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,480
OK

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,720
Why do you shoot?

58
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,760
Well…

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,460
Hey,

60
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,540
Huh?

61
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,260
-Boo-stah! -Boo-stah!

62
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,060
You! You deliberately made a mistake at the end!

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,780
Ryo-tsu Shunsa, the first to make a mistake, gets 99 points!

64
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,640
Therefore, the winner of the men's division, Nakagawa Shunsa, is the second-place winner, Ryo-tsu Shunsa!

65
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,260
I can't believe it!

66
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,740
It's just like this.

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,920
Ryo-sama! It's wonderful!

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,020
Now we can go to overseas training together!

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,600
You made a mistake on purpose!

70
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm very excited to go to training with my seniors!

71
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,480
It was on purpose, Ryo-tsu!

72
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,580
You're doing great, Ryo-chan! You've reviewed it!

73
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,620
It was on purpose, right? Say it was on purpose!

74
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,760
I did it. A vacation abroad with coffee!

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,720
Please say it was on purpose!

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,380
Right, Ryo-tsu?

77
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,040
Why is it so?

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
The only reason I'm happy with my senior is because I love my senior!

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,620
Why don't they have aТыO?

80
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:01,920
But they are the only ones who are happy with it.

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,460
If it was on purpose, it would be a pity.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,120
It's this one.

83
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,040
Okay, okay, that's it!

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,720
But, I also couldn't wear it!

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,660
It seems that only my senior and I can find a title offer for the company.

86
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,380
It's just your knowledge, Shun!

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,840
Keiichi Shinpachi's knowledge is what's important!

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,640
Listen, everyone.

89
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,660
Really?

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,500
I'll take care of the training and take you to the dream full course of Patsukin Bakunyugyaru.

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,200
But I don't have Otohime-chan...

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,720
Oh, right. Then I'll have to take care of Patsukin Bakunyugyaru myself.

93
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,660
It's a shame. I'm a Patsukin Bakunyugyaru, but it's a waste.

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,640
Patsukin Bakunyugyaru, Patsukin Bakunyugyaru, Patsukin Bakunyugyaru...

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,440
Senpai, I'll follow you!

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,560
I see. I'm counting on you, Captain Kirikomi!

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,860
Okay...

98
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,820
Ryo-sama!

99
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,980
What's a Patsukin Bakunyugyaru?

100
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,920
That's...

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,060
No, no, no! Don't do that!

102
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,940
Get off! Get off!

103
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,080
Well then, shall we go?

104
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Huh? Where are Senpai and Honda-san?

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,280
They were here just now.

106
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,860
It's about Ryo-chan, so maybe they're going to have a Patsukin Bakunyugyaru party at the beach.

107
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,280
Ryo-sama, wait!

108
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,680
Hey, Honda, I'm glad you came.

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Yes, yes, yes.

110
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,840
Well then, let's go!

111
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,740
Yes!

112
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,280
We'll apply oil for free.

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
If you wish, we'll give you a massage.

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,620
We'll apply oil for free.

115
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,280
How about a massage?

116
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
What are you doing?

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,320
Ryo-sama, I'm here to practice, aren't I?

118
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,140
Honda-san will go to Otohime-chan, too.

119
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,300
No, don't bother about that!

120
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,760
Oh, you brought a lot.

121
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,420
Of course.

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,760
You can even shoot guns that you can't shoot in Japan here.

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Senpai and Honda-san, please take whatever you like.

124
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,120
Oh, is that so?

125
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,340
I'll be right back.

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,360
Good luck with your practice.

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,380
Good luck!

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Good luck!

129
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,740
Good luck!

130
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,240
Good luck!

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Good luck!

132
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,820
Good luck!

133
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,300
Ryo-chan, did you hear that?

134
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,060
A male instructor is going to become a great man at a young age.

135
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
A great man?

136
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,700
Even though he's Japanese, it can't be that he'd become a Greenberry of the American Army.

137
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,380
He's been fighting wars all over the world.

138
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,900
After that, he was also a sniper who did many things for the mafia in New York.

139
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,620
Hehehe...

140
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,000
Interesting!

141
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,900
We should have him do a lot of work, right Honda?

142
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,620
Huh?

143
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm going home!

144
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,780
Don't be scared. I'm here!

145
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,060
Huh?

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,120
Why? No one's here.

147
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
You're late!

148
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,560
Huh?

149
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
I, Saigo Borubo, will teach you all for a week.

150
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,800
Don't be late from now on.

151
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:32,980
What?

152
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,940
I'm going to do it!

153
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
You scared me, bastard!

154
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,580
Listen to this.

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:46,820
Huh?

156
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,380
Next time you come any closer, I'll kill you.

157
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,400
Not yet!

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,860
Gcrr!

159
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,940
We won't let you pass!

160
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,040
Hehehe...

161
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,180
I expected that. I've had enough of thatك

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,540
As expected, this is the Special Training festival training. We've had enough of that.

163
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,120
I don't want to be beaten anymore.

164
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,740
I want to go home.

165
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,960
What are you going to do with that?

166
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,240
The morning training is just for the sake of it.

167
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,040
The afternoon training is even more difficult.

168
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
I want to go home.

169
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,860
Well...

170
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,580
Stop!

171
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,460
Idiot!

172
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,360
Why did you suddenly shoot?

173
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,280
He was just looking for his wallet!

174
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,560
In New York, they say that if you put your hand in a place, you will be shot.

175
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,780
Even if you shoot, it's still a fair defense.

176
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,400
This is not New York!

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,460
I see.

178
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,500
This is a failure.

179
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,940
Who is the guy who just made a gun hammer?

180
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm asking for backup.

181
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,220
Idiot!

182
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,160
Where is the enemy?

183
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,520
That's what I'm talking about.

184
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,400
What are you doing?

185
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,440
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
The body reacts to any sound in the Green Beret era.

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,760
This is a failure again!

188
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,600
I want to go home.

189
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,480
However, this is not enough to eat or drink.

190
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,840
We will hold the gun.

191
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,900
Is this okay?

192
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,680
OK.

193
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,320
What is the bulge on your chest?

194
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,500
This is...

195
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,320
Show me what you got!

196
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,080
This is...

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,140
What's this?

198
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,020
I'm sure you didn't hide anything else.

199
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,100
Yes.

200
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,400
Really?

201
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,140
Yes.

202
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Absolutely.

203
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,780
Now, Nagagawa, take a look at your pants.

204
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
I have a bad PPK.

205
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,400
There is a chief here.

206
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,640
What do you mean?

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,480
No.

208
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,560
For the sake of the moment.

209
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,320
Stretch your right hand as much as you can.

210
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,820
What?

211
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,400
What do you mean?

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,600
I don't care.

213
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,960
I said stretch your right hand.

214
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,500
Yes.

215
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,120
You are a hidden beast.

216
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,020
The Beretta Minx is on my left arm, too.

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,940
In this case, take off your clothes and check thoroughly.

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,720
No way.

219
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:31,540
Six small automatic guns, four Derringers, 120 bullets, three main guns, one plastic bomb, and six knives.

220
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,460
What?

221
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,600
You are hiding the full sound of the motel behind your back.

222
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,960
No.

223
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,060
What?

224
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,400
What are you talking about?

225
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
You are a walking weapon.

226
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,040
What?

228
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,740
What?

229
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,140
What is this bulge?

230
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,740
This is not a Desert Eagle.

231
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
Oh.

232
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,200
Oh.

233
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,160
Oh.

234
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,680
Oh.

235
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:51,720
It's gone.

236
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,640
What is a Desert Eagle?

237
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,880
It's a Nyanbu squid.

238
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,940
Excuse me.

239
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000
I just got a little bit of a problem.

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,160
We will take care of these.

241
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,060
No.

242
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,640
No.

243
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,440
All right.

244
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,940
Now, let's go.

245
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,300
A Coke.

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
A Coke.

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
A Coke.

248
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,400
Thank you!

249
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,540
Thank you!

250
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,360
It's a

251
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,340
Cucumber.

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,100
Where is it?

253
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,000
It's here.

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,560
Cucumber!

255
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,540
Cucumber!

256
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,940
Cucumber!

257
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,560
He's more pathetic than me.

258
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,300
This is terrible.

259
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,020
If Ryo is here, he'll go eat lunch with me.

260
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,540
That's fine.

261
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,800
We'll eat lunch together.

262
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,800
But...

263
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,180
I saw him!

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,820
What are you doing?

265
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,440
Oh, did I do too much?

266
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,900
Are you all right?

267
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,780
Who is this weirdo?

268
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,320
He's our instructor, Mr. Saigo Borubo.

269
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,620
He's so pathetic.

270
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,820
This place used to be full of men.

271
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,600
But a beauty came closer and...

272
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,460
My nose...

273
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,460
Please use it if you like.

274
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,460
Thank you.

275
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,100
What?

276
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,900
What's this?

277
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,440
The shock that pierced through this body...

278
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,380
It's beautiful.

279
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,840
I need a handkerchief.

280
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:54,980
Sorry.

281
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,180
This is strange.

282
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,520
I can't tell the difference between this beauty and this nose.

283
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,180
Could it be...

284
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,620
Connected by this woman?

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,360
Actually...

286
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,820
Yes?

287
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,960
Well...

288
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Please have a date with me.

289
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,580
I'll go back to my room and get changed.

290
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,520
Let's meet in front of the fountain in front of this park in 30 minutes.

291
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,500
B-But...

292
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,980
Well...

293
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,180
Bye.

294
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,540
Ryo-sama! I don't want to date that kind of guy!

295
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,280
Please do something!

296
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,200
Hmm...

297
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,360
No, you should date him, Maria!

298
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,080
What?

299
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
No way!

300
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,360
That's terrible...

301
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,400
That's too terrible!

302
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,160
Ryo-chan, what are you saying?

303
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,280
Don't get excited!

304
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,940
Listen to me carefully!

305
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,960
He's a strange man who shoots at anyone, anywhere, and to everyone.

306
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,300
He's a strange man.

307
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,280
I don't think he's a strange man. He's a strange man.

308
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:11,600
I think the reason why he's so strange is because he's been living in a male-only, military-only, New York-style, and male-only job.

309
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,020
That's understandable.

310
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,960
He probably never dated a woman.

311
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,840
If he's on a date, it's a good chance to change his personality.

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,820
That's true, but Maria is a man.

313
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,640
That's why he's a man.

314
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,940
He's just as strange as he is.

315
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,820
But still, I don't want to date any other men except for Ryo-sama.

316
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,100
Maria, should I kill you?

317
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,100
What?

318
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,200
We'll be in training with that walking weapon for a week.

319
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,400
We can shoot him with any gun, but it's not that strange!

320
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,920
So, Maria, we'll be saved if you beat him up here!

321
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,340
Do you understand, Maria?!

322
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,460
...

323
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,500
Understood!

324
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm going on a date for Ryo-sama!

325
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,420
You don't need to worry about it, Maria.

326
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,620
We have to follow him quietly...

327
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,820
I'll go with you, Ryo.

328
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Will you come with me, Ryo?

329
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,580
Well, I guess.

330
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,800
I knew it! You're Ryo!

331
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm so happy!

332
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,340
I told you not to get in the way!

333
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,520
There she is.

334
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,000
She's coming at the right time.

335
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,040
She doesn't have a rifle, does she?

336
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Look closely.

337
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,860
She's holding a gun with her right hand.

338
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
She has a gun on her left side.

339
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,340
She has a gun on her left side.

340
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,480
She has a revolver on her left and right.

341
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,000
She has a revolver on her left and right.

342
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,500
Her pockets are full of bullets.

343
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,300
She's right.

344
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
She still has a gun even though she took it just now.

345
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
She's so cowardly.

346
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,260
She always has a good position to fight.

347
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,700
She's always good to her eyes.

348
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,340
She's like a SP for the mercenary guard.

349
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,300
She's a very good date.

350
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,580
She's a very good date.

351
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,680
Maria, start the operation.

352
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll follow you in the car.

353
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,360
Yes, sir.

354
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,160
Oh, it's you.

355
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry. I got close from behind.

356
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,240
My name is Asato Ai.

357
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,980
Everyone calls me Maria.

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,520
Nice to meet you.

359
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,620
I'm here for a little...

361
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,460
Well, let's go.

362
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,280
Okay.

363
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,680
Are you okay, Maria?

364
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,620
Don't you regret it a little bit, Senpai?

365
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,640
A little bit.

366
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,640
Why are you wearing a suit and jungle boots?

367
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,060
Well, it's easier to move when something happens.

368
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,400
Well, it's easier to move when something happens.

369
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,060
It's iron-coated, so I can beat a cow in one shot.

370
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,360
It's iron-coated, so I can beat a cow in one shot.

371
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,740
I was on the battlefield as a mercenary for a long time.

372
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,520
After that, I became very diligent.

373
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,320
After that, I became very diligent.

374
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,300
Maria, hide!

375
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,200
Maria, hide!

376
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,000
Maria, hide!

377
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Are you having fun?

378
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,820
What's wrong?

379
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,940
The mafia once shot a car.

380
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,860
I was shot by a car, so it's hard to get close to a strange car.

381
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh no, oh no, you're too close.

382
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,080
You're a great guy, Mr. Volvo.

384
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,760
There was a shotgun in that flower pot.

385
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,160
I can't get close without flying.

386
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,180
That is the M60 tank with the reactive armor.

387
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,640
Reactive armor is explosive reaction armor.

388
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,360
In other words, even if you're hit by a war missile,

389
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
it's the latest armor that reduces damage due to the reaction of the armor explosion.

390
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Do you understand?

391
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,780
Yes.

392
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,460
If you think about where you're going on a date,

393
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,200
it's a gang movie and a war movie.

394
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,580
Maria, I feel sorry for you.

395
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,040
You've been looking for weapons for three hours.

396
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,000
Maria, I feel sorry for you.

397
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,200
Be with me.

398
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,400
No, be with me on the premise of marriage.

399
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,020
What?

400
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,660
No, I don't mean anything.

401
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,960
This time, I went to a sports gym.

402
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
What kind of dating course is it?

403
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,740
It's unique.

404
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,840
Poor Maria.

405
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,220
Alright, let's go!

406
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,920
15!

407
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,080
He comes to this gym every day.

408
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,920
He's training his body, isn't he?

409
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, my!

410
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,300
Is it a punching ball?

411
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,840
I'll try it.

412
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,800
It's dangerous, so please stay away from it.

413
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,340
Yes.

414
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,620
Amazing! He's really good at it!

415
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,780
I thought I'd lost my grip a little bit.

416
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,140
That bastard got carried away.

417
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,440
Hey, Maria!

418
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,320
Yes?

419
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,660
You try it, too.

420
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Is that okay?

421
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,700
Yeah, do it!

422
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,780
Yes!

423
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,920
I'll try it, too!

424
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,260
Are you okay?

425
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,040
Yes!

426
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm sorry.

427
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,140
It's amazing!

428
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,940
Amazing punching power!

429
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,180
I was practicing kickboxing a little bit.

430
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,400
Kickboxing?

431
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,260
Kickboxing?

432
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,080
Kickboxing?

433
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,560
I can't imagine it.

434
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,120
What's wrong?

435
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,240
Nothing.

436
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
That's right.

437
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,120
There is a pool in the back.

438
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,820
It's wide and the atmosphere is great.

439
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,480
But what about the swimsuit?

440
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,340
There's a rental.

441
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,320
Let's go.

442
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:11,940
Let's go.

443
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,280
Let's go.

444
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,180
Let's go.

445
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,840
Let's go.

446
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,660
Let's go.

447
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,160
One, two, three!

448
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,860
Two, three, four.

449
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,080
One, two, three, four.

450
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,340
Two, two, three, four.

451
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,420
One, two, three, four.

452
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,880
Let's get married...

453
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,600
Let's get married...

454
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:27,820
to...

455
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,520
Well, it's true that...

456
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,720
I'm waiting.

457
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,700
I'm waiting.

458
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,740
Oh?

459
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,740
Beautiful!

460
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,200
When I was at a job full of men,

461
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
I didn't know that women are so beautiful!

462
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,660
Um...

463
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,040
What is that?

464
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,820
Um...

465
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,020
This is...

466
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,240
It's the Heckler & Koch P-11.

467
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,940
It's a pistol that can be fired underwater.

468
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,980
Unless you have this in the pool,

469
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,540
you will be targeted at places where you can't use your weapons, such as the pool or the pool.

470
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,960
I had this experience while I was in the mercenary service.

471
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,140
That's why I kept my holster on even when I took a bath.

472
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,300
This school is so cheap.

473
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,560
It's almost a pervert school.

474
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,580
The pool is really big!

475
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,760
Ah, uh, Maria...

476
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,500
Huh?

477
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,360
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-a nice weather.

478
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,540
I'm going to make a "hito-oyaki!"

479
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,880
He's so powerful.

480
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,840
It's a big trouble surrounding us.

481
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,600
Ah, ugh.

482
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,420
Huh?

483
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,520
I-I-I'm screwed!

484
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,680
Get out of the pool!

485
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,060
Get out of here!

486
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,640
You're gonna make me the captain, huh?

487
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,640
How can you swim in that form?

488
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,020
Maria, it's the enemy! Hide!

489
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,840
Um, is that explosion yours, Mr. Boruto?

490
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,000
Huh?

491
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Oh, it's true!

492
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Oh, everyone, please be quiet! I accidentally shot the main gun in the middle of...

493
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,260
It's not accidentally, that idiot!

494
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,580
After all, he's a walking weapon.

495
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,220
Oh, Maria and the others!

496
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,700
Yeah?

497
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,060
You're going to climb into the diving platform, aren't you?

498
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,920
Oh, no. I can't keep up with you up there.

499
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,940
Maria!

500
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,860
Um, how far are we going to climb?

501
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,680
It's a great opportunity, so let's go to the top!

502
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,020
It's an amazing height...

503
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,920
M- Maria!

504
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,160
Y- Yes?

505
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,280
Actually, um, that...

506
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,200
Ge- ge- ge- ge- ge-

507
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,600
Nooo!

508
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,300
It looks like we're in a dangerous state.

509
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,160
What should I do?

510
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,540
There's no point! Just tell her that you're a man!

511
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,780
I- I understand.

512
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,860
Actually, I have something to tell her.

513
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:45,900
Huh?

514
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,840
A- a confession of love from Maria-san?

515
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,600
Actually, I'm a man!

516
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,780
What?

517
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Ahaha!

518
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,140
Is this a joke?

519
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,840
I don't want to hear it at a time like this!

520
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,640
A- more importantly, Maria-san, me and...

521
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,560
Ryo-sama, you don't believe me at all.

522
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,560
What should I do?

523
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,980
It can't be helped. I'll show you the evidence that you're a man!

524
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:07,680
What? It can't be helped. I'll show you the evidence that you're a man!

525
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,780
What? It can't be helped. I'll show you the evidence that you're a man!

526
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,500
That's right! You have to show that evidence to a man, Maria!

527
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,800
I- I can't do such a disgusting thing!

528
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,940
I don't care what happens, Maria!

529
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,340
I don't want to do it!

530
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,960
Do it, Maria!

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,040
I- I don't want to do it!

532
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
Look closely at me, please!

533
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,680
I- I don't want to do it!

534
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,160
I- I don't want to do it!

535
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,400
I- I don't want to do it!

536
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,460
M- Maria-san, you're...

537
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,560
I- I don't want to do it!

538
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,480
I- I don't want to do it!

539
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,980
I- I don't want to do it!

540
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,800
I- I don't want to do it!

541
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,180
No way...

542
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,900
If you're one meter from the pool, it's just a pool...

543
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,140
They're too hard to save.

544
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,400
I- I- that's impossible...

545
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,660
I- I was lying down... I was lying down...

546
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,160
It's a disaster!

547
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,680
I really did something bad to Mr. Bulbul yesterday.

548
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,000
Don't worry about it.

549
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,440
Thanks to you, I don't have to learn from that armory instructor.

550
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,260
If you had learned from him, you wouldn't have lost so many lives.

551
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,320
Fantasia!

552
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,180
Good morning!

553
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,320
Well, I was executed yesterday.

554
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,580
Why are you here?

555
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:34,660
I'm here!

556
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,260
Didn't you get hospitalized?

557
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,520
No, I didn't get hospitalized for a scratch like this.

558
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,060
You fell from such a high place.

559
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
I'm training.

560
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,320
You're not a human.

561
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,600
Well, I'm sorry about yesterday.

562
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,700
No, don't worry about it.

563
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
I thought it was strange.

564
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,940
I didn't get any nosebleeds even though I was such a beautiful woman.

565
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,040
Anyway, Maria.

566
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,160
Now that you know that I'm a man, you should train with Mr. Ryotsu and the others.

567
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,240
What?

568
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm fine. I'll do it.

569
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,560
Don't bother.

570
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,400
If you can train that punch, you can do a Green Belly.

571
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,900
What? John?

572
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,940
I told you not to get so close to my back.

573
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,940
I'm sorry.

574
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,700
I got an airmail from America.

575
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,320
America?

576
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,620
This is...

577
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,340
What's wrong?

578
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,660
You suddenly look pale.

579
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,440
It's an unfortunate letter.

580
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,280
That's all.

581
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,040
What?

582
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,760
What?

583
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,720
Captain Bakuryu is coming.

584
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,120
And today.

585
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,280
Captain Bakuryu?

586
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,460
Who is he?

587
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
He's the commander of the Green Belly.

588
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,560
He's a soldier who broke through many shurabas.

589
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,640
He's a soldier who broke through many shurabas.

590
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,640
He's a soldier who broke through many shurabas.

591
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:49,980
He's a good-looking man.

592
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,700
He's the commander of the Volvo.

593
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,880
He's a terrible pervert.

594
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,100
You're right.

595
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,280
He's a terrible pervert.

596
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
It's not a joke.

597
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,920
He's a scary man who's called the evil army.

598
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,760
He's not an army.

599
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,360
He's a colonel.

600
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,260
He's a colonel.

601
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,380
The toxicity of the colonel is not kidding.

602
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,040
How many times have I tried to escape from here?

603
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,220
I'm afraid that the captain's squad is the strongest in the world.

604
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,100
Someone is enough!

605
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,280
This way, we won't be defeated.

606
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,800
Don't suddenly lower your hand.

607
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,520
The whole body shall gather in the waiting room.

608
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
It's only a bullet 방 agreed.

609
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,540
You should change your clothes too.

610
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,300
No matter how much I try, am I going overboard?

611
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,240
That can be said because you don't know the terror of the colonel.

612
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,240
It can be said because you don't know the terror of the colonel.

613
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,060
He's the one who's going to hit me instead of greeting me.

614
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,060
I don't care even if I hit a shooting ball.

615
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,080
Don't scare me.

616
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,720
Anyway, you should change as you were told.

617
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,820
Like Mr. Honda.

618
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,620
That was quick.

619
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
I want to go home!

620
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,520
I want to go home!

621
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,340
Are you going to send rocket launchers to the Balkans

622
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
and start a war?

623
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,140
This is not enough.

624
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,440
I want a tank as well.

625
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,520
What?

626
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,060
This music is Wagner's Walcure.

627
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,560
Why can I hear it from outside?

628
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
The colonel asked me

629
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,460
if I could hear it.

630
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,000
It must be the sound of a helicopter.

631
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,020
I knew it.

632
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,400
Isn't it a helicopter from the mass media?

633
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,980
That is...

634
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,740
It's an Apache!

635
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,340
Why is the American military aircraft here?

636
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,320
They're coming this way.

637
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,660
Get them all!

638
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,040
All of you get on the wall!

639
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,060
I didn't expect the rocket launchers

640
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,480
to come all of a sudden.

641
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,680
I told you so.

642
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,400
Stop it!

643
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,100
My gosh! Did you miss it?

644
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,560
It's about the colonel.

645
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,260
I'll go back ten times, no, a hundred times!

646
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,980
Get out of here!

647
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,160
You've gone too far, Polvo!

648
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,320
This is what happened because I used a rocket launcher!

649
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
What are you talking about? You must have prepared that!

650
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,580
That's to protect myself.

651
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,640
It's not for attacking!

652
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,400
Um, I came down, but...

653
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm sorry.

654
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,060
It's been a while, Bolgo Saigo.

655
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,620
Is this the colonel?

656
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,200
It's been a while, colonel!

657
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,500
You look good in military clothes.

658
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,020
As usual.

659
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,840
Thank you!

660
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,060
You're too naive, Saigo!

661
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,080
You're too naive, Saigo!

662
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,420
I really shot him!

663
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,860
He's a terrible man!

664
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,020
He's not that bad.

665
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,120
But he can't be a soldier who's one year older.

666
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,620
We're not soldiers!

667
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,400
You! You're not a soldier who's one year older.

668
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,040
You're not a soldier who's one year older.

669
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,780
I don't remember having you as my colonel!

670
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,660
Shut up!

671
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,020
I won't forgive you for your words.

672
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,640
You're too naive!

673
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
You destroyed the training ground!

674
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,060
You're way too naive!

675
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,620
Goodness, sir!

676
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,500
The child of sums that has to be taken down completely.

677
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,240
That's the key that 기억ed my life.

678
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,180
That's the intensive rank of survival.

679
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,480
Even so, it was a big scratch, wasn't it?

680
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,740
Yes.

681
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,140
Young lady Oji-ho!

682
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,180
You noticed this in good place.

683
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,600
Yes, sir!

684
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,320
Your face is just a small part.

685
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,100
Your face is just a small part.

686
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,040
This fight is my history.

687
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,140
Amazing!

688
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:34,880
This is my history.

689
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,940
This is after I was shot in Vietnam.

690
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,320
This is done after I was shot in Vietnam.

691
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,360
This is after I was shot in Vietnam.

692
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,120
This is the wound at Falkland Line.

693
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,800
This is the wound at Falkland Line.

694
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,400
This is Wei Ruan Line.

695
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,620
However...

696
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,520
However...

697
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:44,940
That.

698
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,500
thady

699
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,640
That.

700
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,000
When he was arrested by his wife.

701
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,220
It seems like there is something wrong with him.

702
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,900
It's easy to get an accordion for such a long distance.

703
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,440
No, no, no. He is the kind of person who wants to talk.

704
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,140
Do you think he'll be fine, anyway?

705
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,900
What do you mean by "I think"?

706
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,560
I do not think so.

707
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,540
Excuse me? This is my director's room.

708
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,360
I thought so too.

709
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,500
Ouch!

710
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,420
You're injured because you're weak after all!

711
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,860
What?

712
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,260
What do you mean?

713
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,900
You're quite brave.

714
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,080
Well, not really.

715
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,060
What's the name of this lawless man?

716
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,880
I call him Ryotsu.

717
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,360
Mr. Ryotsu, you're not afraid of anything.

718
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
I can't believe you're giving me your opinion.

719
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,880
I'll give you something wonderful.

720
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,940
What's that?

721
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
It's the best gift.

722
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,000
It's a present.

723
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh, it's on my back!

724
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,500
What did you put in it?

725
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,500
Tell me!

726
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,340
Did you see the power of the Shiryudan?

727
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,080
This is what happens when you make me angry.

728
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,900
Maybe I used too little medicine.

729
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,920
Maybe I should have used more.

730
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,860
You idiot!

731
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,660
You're not a kid!

732
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,240
Don't use things like a knee beater!

733
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,640
By the way, why are you here, Colonel?

734
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,380
I forgot.

735
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,140
Hey!

736
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,860
4th

737
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,940
Here! I'm Ryotsu. Nice to meet you!

738
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,920
I'm Honda.

739
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,460
I'm Volvo.

740
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,840
Nice to meet you, I'm Jody.

741
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,840
Jody is my daughter.

742
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,400
You're lying.

743
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,760
It's true. I'm a mother.

744
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,040
I see.

745
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,300
Actually, I chose you as my bride for Jody's wedding.

746
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,060
Nice to meet you.

747
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,780
You're talking too much.

748
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,060
Think about it, Porubo.

749
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,280
No matter how good a woman you are, your father is that guy.

750
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
If you say so.

751
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,520
Saigo, can I make this nice buddy yours?

752
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,760
If you marry her, you'll have 1000 times more land in Yankees Stadium.

753
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
1000 times more land in Yankees Stadium?

754
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,980
Captain, please give her to me.

755
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,900
Don't apologize.

756
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,940
There are many other candidates.

757
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,300
I will finally choose one among them.

758
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,780
I see.

759
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,720
I believe that a man must be strong.

760
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,320
I know a strong man.

761
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,680
I will choose one among those strong men.

762
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,600
But, Porubo hates women.

763
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,820
What the hell are you talking about?

764
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,620
Captain, I'm confident that you're strong.

765
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,680
Please choose me as your candidate.

766
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,620
You're dirty. How dare you sell yourself!

767
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,420
Ryo!

768
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,720
Nakagawa and Honda will choose you as their candidate.

769
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,440
I...

770
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,400
Run!

771
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,640
Captain!

772
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,580
Mr. Nakagawa!

773
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,360
It's a rubber club.

774
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,080
What?

775
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,840
You're wearing a bulletproof vest.

776
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,200
Yeah.

777
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,360
All right.

778
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,480
If Saigo wins, you pass the test.

779
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:06,900
Yay!

780
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,100
Me too?

781
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,160
What's up with your happiness, Ryo?

782
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,460
I'm so frustrated.

783
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,980
He's that kind of man.

784
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,020
Give up.

785
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,420
Well, I'm fine.

786
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,140
So, I'll quit this time.

787
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,500
What?

788
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,020
You!

789
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,260
You're a coward!

790
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,100
Bust 95.

791
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,900
West 58.

792
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,460
Hip 90.

793
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:29,540
Keep moving!

794
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,180
Do you hate this nice body?

795
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,000
Ah, but I have Otohime...

796
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,120
You're going to insult your daughter?

797
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,780
What?

798
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,680
No, I don't mean that!

799
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,180
Then, you can pass the test.

800
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,280
Yes, of course, I'll pass.

801
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,900
What?

802
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,260
Why did you have to say that from the beginning?

803
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,540
Good luck.

804
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh.

805
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,420
Ah...

806
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,680
Yes! Honda Hayato will do his best!

807
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,980
Alright! Then, the three of us will go to Africa for the final test!

808
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,340
Yeah! Africa!

809
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,640
Africa!

810
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,400
Now, here in Africa, we will hold the competition of my daughter Jody's pick of flowers.

811
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,120
You are all chosen from many candidates, and you are all very tough.

812
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,780
The only man in this world who is the strongest man,

813
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,960
and you are all ready to marry Jody.

814
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,640
This is the final battle of Africa's great ultra course.

815
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,360
You will pass this course and win the one who reaches the goal as soon as possible.

816
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,860
The course is, from here, you will cut through the savanna and cross the river,

817
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,280
and then cross the savanna and the desert, and the summit of the mountain after that.

818
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,560
The course is 100 kilometers long.

819
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,160
Now, I hope you will consider it.

820
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,340
Wait a minute!

821
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,660
What?

822
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,160
It's too much if the enemy has a knife in Africa with a dog!

823
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,400
Yeah! It's too much if the enemy has a knife in Africa with a dog!

824
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,260
Yeah! It's too much if the enemy has a knife in Africa with a dog!

825
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,760
Yeah! It's too much if the enemy has a knife in Africa with a dog!

826
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,260
Yeah! It's too much if the enemy has a knife in Africa with a dog!

827
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,820
It's true. At least, a rifle is enough.

828
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,360
That's not the case!

829
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,220
A man who is really strong has a knife and a gun.

830
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,200
Whoever has a grudge should be disqualified here.

831
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,840
Yeah, I'm fine as long as I'm disqualified.

832
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,840
Everyone, be careful and do your best.

833
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,420
Chu.

834
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,320
You...

835
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,920
Okay, I'll do my best!

836
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,760
If you buy it and marry, you will get 1000 times the land of Yankees Stadium.

837
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,160
In other words, it's worth a million dollars.

838
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,380
How can you stop now?

839
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,280
I'll be a flower boy.

840
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,600
I'll become a true thief.

841
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,660
I can't lose this match.

842
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,520
Then, get ready for the position.

843
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,860
The course is full of mountains and valleys.

844
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,080
There may be a hole to fall.

845
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,260
What's that?

846
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,480
Ouch!

847
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,760
Are you okay?

848
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,280
Ouch!

849
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,640
Well...

850
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,520
But, I can't do anything.

851
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,780
Senior, if I really fall, you will pull me up, won't you?

852
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,320
Don't worry. I'll go with you.

853
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,120
Okay.

854
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,920
Ouch!

855
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,840
That was close. It wasn't just a hole to fall.

856
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,800
That's right.

857
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,000
I'll go with you.

858
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,540
I'll go with you.

859
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
I'll go with you.

860
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,800
Senior, the movie trap is over.

861
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,600
Hello.

862
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm so sorry.

863
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,660
You have to be careful until the end.

864
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,660
Right?

865
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,020
Yes.

866
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,240
Yes.

867
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,020
Yes.

868
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,260
Yes.

869
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,260
Yes.

870
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,120
Yes.

871
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,500
Yes.

872
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,200
Yes.

873
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,180
Yes.

874
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,780
Yes.

875
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,180
Yes.

876
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,460
Yes.

877
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,300
Yes.

878
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,700
Is- is it really a trap?

879
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,620
Let's move outside.

880
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,300
Means the hadron has been removed.

881
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,680
We're coming!

882
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,300
Yes.

883
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,880
Yes.

884
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:18,980
Yes.

885
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,280
Yes.

886
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,500
Yes.

887
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,120
Yes.

888
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,540
Yes.

889
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:22,580
Geez.

890
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,840
It's a trap!

891
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:23,980
Yes.

892
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,100
I think it's a trap too.

893
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,120
It's a trap.

894
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,620
Oh.

895
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,160
I see.

896
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,560
Yes, yes, yes.

897
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,160
What should we do?

898
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,600
It's very dangerous!

899
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,200
Yes.

900
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,540
Poof!

901
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,440
So, Mr. Ryozu did it that way.

902
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,200
I-I...

903
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,580
Yeah!

904
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,460
I-I will definitely be in danger!

905
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,400
I will never allow danger!

906
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,160
Yes, look at that!

907
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,380
Kiryu ability:

908
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,600
Kiryu ability:

909
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,720
Kiryu ability:

910
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:28,340
Kiryu ability:

911
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,300
Zzz! Zzz! Zzz!

912
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:31,940
Nooooo!

913
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,300
Hey! That hurts! Let go!

914
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,760
Lucky.

915
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,440
But what did I get this afternoon?

916
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,240
Zzz!

917
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,820
What are you doing here, Borugo?

918
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,300
Help me!

919
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,560
Help me!

920
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,960
If you go out, you'll be in their way.

921
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,700
I-I-I'm going home.

922
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,260
Huh?

923
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,480
Senpai, that...

924
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,660
What?

925
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,320
Help me!

926
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:28,560
Help me!

927
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,600
It's a ostrich's toy.

928
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,240
What is this?

929
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,300
Hey, look at that!

930
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,060
I see.

931
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,240
You can't tell by its appearance.

932
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,260
But I feel like I'll be exposed once I wake up.

933
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,300
But if you get eaten by it,

934
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,840
it'll be an embarrassment for you to the end.

935
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,540
You're right.

936
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,460
I don't think there's any animal like this.

937
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,480
You're right.

938
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,960
Help me!

939
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,380
Help me!

940
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,780
You've made a mistake.

941
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,460
Oh, no!

942
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,540
that would be awful.

943
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,640
What?

944
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,560
How about a'mari tout?

945
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,060
How about that?

946
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,140
That's a good idea.

947
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,920
We did it!

948
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,800
Brood of a monster.

949
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,540
But thanks to you, I was saved.

950
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,080
Mr. Ryotsu, I won't waste your sacrifice, so please make it up to me.

951
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,800
How many are there? How many are there?

952
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,000
Your luck is that you bit my stone head.

953
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,140
Your luck is that you bit my stone head.

954
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,160
Let's go!

955
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,820
You know how to play.

956
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,940
It's a goal! I see the goal!

957
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,800
It's a goal! I see the goal!

958
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,480
Who's going to climb that?

959
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,960
There's no way I can climb that!

960
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,640
There's no way I can climb that!

961
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,240
It's impossible. It's impossible.

962
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,540
Alright, let's go!

963
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,280
It's impossible! We'll die if we fall down the middle of the road!

964
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,980
What about the others?

965
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,580
Don't you have the intention of marrying your daughter and becoming a rich man?

966
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,480
Don't you have the intention of marrying your daughter and becoming a rich man?

967
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,320
Don't you have the intention of marrying your daughter and becoming a rich man?

968
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,060
Don't you have the intention of marrying your daughter and becoming a rich man?

969
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,620
I want to go home!

970
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,240
I want to go home!

971
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,680
Why are you doing that to me?

972
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,540
Why are you doing that to me?

973
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,200
Ryotsu! You're not going to lose!

974
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,780
Ryotsu! You're not going to lose!

975
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,580
From now on, the real hell awaits you.

976
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,780
Begin attack!

977
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,240
Two target fighters!

978
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,840
What did you come up with, you fisherman?!

979
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,400
What did you come up with, you fisherman?!

980
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:46,980
This is the kind of person the Colonel is!

981
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,140
This is the kind of person the Colonel is!

982
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,020
Oh, no!

983
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,020
Lucky! You're gonna be my

984
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,180
I'm gonna be your

985
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,580
I'm gonna be your

986
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,120
I'm gonna be your

987
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,780
I'm gonna be your

988
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,720
I'm gonna be your

989
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,340
I'm gonna be your

990
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,300
I'm gonna be your

991
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,140
I'm gonna be your

992
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,620
I'm gonna be your

993
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,840
I'm gonna be your

994
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,040
I'm gonna be your

995
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,900
lucky

996
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,060
lucky

997
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,340
I'm gonna be your

998
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:32,920
lucky

999
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
I'm gonna be your

1000
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,080
I'm gonna be your

1001
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,660
I'm gonna be your

1002
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,020
The last warning is left!

1003
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,720
There's more?

1004
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,940
Th- this is...

1005
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:00,740
The last battle is against Jody!

1006
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,240
Oh, are you alright?

1007
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,120
Hang in there, Saigo!

1008
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,200
Why are you fighting against Jody?

1009
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,760
A man who loses to a woman has no right to do so.

1010
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,720
There's no need to hold back.

1011
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,460
Jody is a Jajauma girl who fought against ten men in the Marine Corps and sent them to the hospital.

1012
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,580
That's right!

1013
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,380
You can fight seriously!

1014
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,380
Alright!

1015
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,300
Try winning and making me your bride!

1016
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,600
From now on, Jody will have the final match against Corvo Saigo!

1017
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,640
Finally, Jajauma girl is...

1018
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,060
It's time to get married, Saigo.

1019
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,180
No, I'm not going to lose to you, Borubo.

1020
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,340
You're alive, aren't you?

1021
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,880
Borubo is strong against men because of the military accident, but he has no immunity against women.

1022
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,540
The match is clear.

1023
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,880
I see.

1024
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,800
What's wrong? Why aren't you fighting?

1025
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,960
After all, it's not right to fight against a woman as a man!

1026
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,980
I don't need your help, Hatsuyo!

1027
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,840
Then, I won't hold back!

1028
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,240
You're the one who should be fighting!

1029
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,420
What?!

1030
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,520
Oh!

1031
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,160
No!

1032
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,020
Change!

1033
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,600
My... my boobs...

1034
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,100
Are you alright? I thought you'd be able to take a good look at yourself...

1035
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,800
My boobs... I thought you'd be able to take a good look at yourself...

1036
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,500
How could you be so weak?

1037
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,800
It can't be helped. Now, Hanamu Koerobi is back to his original form.

1038
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,600
Jody, let's go home!

1039
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,560
Yes, Papa!

1040
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,400
Well, farewell!

1041
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,080
Goodbye!

1042
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,120
After all, it's a waste of time to be a bone-dead.

1043
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,960
Huh? But, senpai, how are we going to go home from here?

1044
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:49,640
Huh?

1045
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,360
Hey! You're going to leave us behind?!

1046
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,580
Give it back to me!

1047
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,260
In the meantime, we'll choose Hanamu Koerobi Part 2.

1048
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,180
If you survive until then, we'll let you participate again!

1049
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,700
I'll be waiting!

1050
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,260
Then, I wish you all good luck.

1051
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,780
Hey, hey, wait! Wait!

1052
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:08,640
Huh?

1053
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,880
Ready, set, go!

1054
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,240
I must know something!

1055
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,260
I have to do something to win!

1056
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:13,900
A lot of people will like Hanamu Koerobi.

1057
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,140
I'd appreciate it!

1058
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,520
Thanks!

1059
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,900
You'll be into my play.

1060
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,500
Of course, I won't.

1061
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:22,540
Can I do that?

1062
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,080
No way.

1063
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,860
Kid, you're really bad!

1064
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,120
No way!

1065
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,640
Your plan was so difficult!

1066
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,540
Agree with me, please?

1067
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,120
I'm starting my return!

1068
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,580
That's a great success!

1069
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,280
That's my favorite!

1070
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,380
