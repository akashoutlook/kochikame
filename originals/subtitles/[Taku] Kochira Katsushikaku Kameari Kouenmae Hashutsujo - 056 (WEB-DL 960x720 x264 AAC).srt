1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,100
In the middle of the sea, dawn was falling

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,560
I picked up my love stone and flew in my shoes

3
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,400
From the water tank of the "Tongari-boshi"

4
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,020
To the "Kai-shakuten"

5
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,960
The sun sets

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,240
"It's already over tomorrow"

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
"Katsushika, Shibamata, and happiness"

8
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,800
I lost them and noticed

9
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,940
That I was the fool

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,740
"Sakuretsu! G-san Power!"

11
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,240
I'm here at Kameyari Park.

12
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,040
What?

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,160
You're a G-san?

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,560
Why do I have to go see what's going on?

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
Why don't you go see it?

16
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,980
What? Is there something important?

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Anyway,

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,220
"Senpai Ryo-san"

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,700
Ryo-chan, I'll tell the headmaster.

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,520
Hey, what are you doing?

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,200
Hey!

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,820
Ryo-san's grandfather must be over a hundred years old.

23
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,680
Oh, my!

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,580
A hundred and sixty?

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
He's still living alone at a young age?

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Anyway, no matter what my father says,

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Tsukuda-jima won't move.

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,140
It's like a mirror for my grandfather.

29
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,440
I have a lot of affection for Tsukuda-jima.

30
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,860
Well, well.

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,680
There are few places in Edo-jocho that remain.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,620
Hmm...

33
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,340
Huh?

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,560
What?

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
I see.

36
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,720
Well, Tsukuda-jima was the fishing town

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
that the Tokugan-eyasu formed in the Edo period.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,180
Oh?

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,000
The Shirauro-ryo family of the Shogunate

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,420
was the pride of the fishermen in Tsukuda-jima.

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
So, did your grandfather also used to be a fisherman?

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,100
No.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,000
My grandfather was a shoemaker who bought the fishing rod

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,340
and ran the fishing house.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,840
So, your father had the shop.

46
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,020
I see.

47
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,620
Well...

48
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,440
It's been a while since I last came here.

49
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,260
Tsukuda-jima has changed a lot.

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,280
It surely is different from what I imagined.

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,100
My grandfather's home was around here.

52
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,460
I see.

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,720
I can't find the name Ryotsu.

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
Hmm...

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,700
If it's a turtle, we can change it.

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,380
What? I don't have a turtle.

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,240
But where is a turtle?

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,360
Nobody has one.

59
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,140
There's a cave in the village where you can't enter.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,040
There's a cave where you can't enter.

61
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,380
If you flash and go in there, you'll find it.

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,100
What? Really?

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,240
Yeah.

64
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,980
By the way, do you know where Ryotsu is?

65
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,820
What?

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,880
Huh?

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,320
I don't know.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,280
Oh, Mr. Ryotsu, you're in danger!

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,340
Are you all right, Mr. Ryotsu?

70
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
What the hell is this?

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,340
It's not a multipurpose gun.

72
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,920
Who did this?

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry...

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,460
Huh?

75
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,180
Gramps!

76
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,860
Huh?

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,620
Gramps...

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Uh-oh!

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,020
Thank goodness! My plane is safe!

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,900
Don't worry about your grandchild!

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,660
Grandchild?

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,420
Oh! It's not my grandchild's family!

83
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,420
Hello!

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
Could it be...

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,140
...that this is your...

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,400
I guess there's something I've made.

87
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,360
A-A grandfather?

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,720
Is it you, grandfather?

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,820
Wasn't it Kito-kun?

90
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,040
Kito-kun?

91
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,820
Who?

92
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,820
I got a call from my father this morning that my grandfather is Kito-kun!

93
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,860
Oh!

94
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,820
I played the game at night and I got a great score!

95
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,700
I told everyone!

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,260
Kito-kun! Kito-kun!

97
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,020
A record score!

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,580
I'll take it easy...

99
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,360
Kito-kun...

100
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,160
Don't make such a fool of yourself!

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,240
You don't need to pay attention to me.

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,100
Nagagawa, Kaeru!

103
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,700
Let's go, Nagagawa.

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,240
Huh? Kaeru?

105
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,400
He's just arrived!

106
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,200
When will the guests who visit this place come again?

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,660
They won't come...

108
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,860
They won't come...

109
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,140
They won't come...

110
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,480
They won't come...

111
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,500
They won't come...

112
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,820
They won't come...

113
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,940
They won't come...

114
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,000
They won't come...

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,100
That old man...

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,700
Senpai, why don't you take your time?

117
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,880
I'll talk to the head of the club about it.

118
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,840
I want you to meet someone.

119
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,540
I'm sure you've met someone.

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,920
They won't come...

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,660
They won't come...

122
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,060
They won't come...

123
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,480
They won't come...

124
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,460
They won't come...

125
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,300
They won't come...

126
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,780
Since you're here, how about having lunch with me?

127
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,960
Lunch?

128
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,260
Are you going to treat me?

129
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,240
Yes, I'm going home!

130
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm in pain.

131
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,980
I've been suffering from a disease that's been relapsing.

132
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,420
Are you okay?

133
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm fine, but...

134
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,740
Esta-

135
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:44,840
It's okay.

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,400
I can't see clearly.

137
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,400
I can't see.

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,920
I can't feel.

139
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,180
I can't feel.

140
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,900
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,220
I have a life of only 106 years.

143
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,200
I've been in a lonely place all my life.

144
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm going to my chief's office, tomorrow.

145
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,540
I'm going to my chief's office, tomorrow.

146
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm going to my chief's office, tomorrow.

147
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,440
What?!

148
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,280
But he said he wanted to meet the prince!

149
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,140
Then, who is he?

150
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,560
He's a bit shy, isn't he?

151
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,920
You're right!

152
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,120
We got it!

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
I got it! I know a place I want to go!

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,920
Is this it?

155
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,860
Look! It's on the information sheet!

156
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,400
This is the most popular place for gals!

157
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,480
Wait, wait, wait!

158
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh! I see!

159
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,440
Oh, I see.

160
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,040
This is delicious!

161
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,360
Hey, if you eat it so hastily, you'll get a stomachache!

162
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,780
This Kororata is really delicious!

163
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,780
Is that Kororata?

164
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,880
It's a word for a lamb called "roast rata".

165
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,560
In short, Kororata.

166
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,520
I got it from Kazuo, so it's even more delicious!

167
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm Kankichi!

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,820
Oh, right, right.

169
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm Kankichi, the son of Kingoro.

170
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,600
I'm a boss!

171
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,660
I'm Ginji!

172
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,360
Yes, yes, I'm Ginji, Ginji.

173
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,100
I run a ramen shop in Aoyama.

174
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,360
It's a Tsukudaniya in Asakusa.

175
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,360
Stop it! I won't eat it anymore!

176
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Give it to me! I'll eat it!

177
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,480
Anyway, I have 24 grandchildren.

179
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,300
Forgive me.

180
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,420
Oh?

181
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
Kanpei! It's Gya-pami!

182
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,180
What?

183
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,100
I can see a gal's pants.

184
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
To put it simply...

185
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,420
Don't joke around!

186
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,360
Just eat it!

187
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
Tsukuda Island has changed a lot.

188
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,240
You can build new buildings one after another.

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,180
There's nothing to be sad about.

190
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,380
Come to think of it, I was a kid and I was stupid about the skyscrapers...

191
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,160
There was no Tsukishima either.

192
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,600
What?

193
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,040
What?

194
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:07,560
What?

195
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,580
What?

196
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:09,960
What?

197
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,280
What's going on here?

198
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,000
Hey!

199
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,360
This is about 100 years ago.

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,200
What the hell?

201
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,460
Why is this one different?

202
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,820
Back in the day, there wasn't even one Tsukuda.

203
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,220
Yeah.

204
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
I heard that you had a boat.

205
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,420
Yes.

206
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,740
I traveled from Akashi-cho to Tsukuda in only four to five minutes.

207
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,000
It's close to Ginza, and I've used it a lot.

208
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,880
You're riding on your own baby.

209
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,320
Really? I don't remember much.

210
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,080
That was when I was still working at the Tsukudaniya.

211
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,280
Your mother came to get the ingredients for the Tsukudaniya.

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
I was going to take you to Asakusa.

213
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,380
I dropped you on the surface of the ship.

214
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,860
I dropped you on the surface of the ship.

215
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,140
What happened?

216
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,260
The ship came out like nothing happened.

217
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,080
What?

218
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,580
I found you floating on the surface of the ship in the middle of the river.

219
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,080
Oh, no! The baby's drowning!

220
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,640
Now I remember.

221
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,260
Don't forget to drown!

222
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, there's another Gyappa!

223
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,960
It's Kankichi!

224
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,460
Was it around here?

225
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,200
What's wrong?

226
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,140
My house is gone!

227
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,700
What?

228
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,360
It was on fire for a few hours when I left my sight.

229
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,180
You idiot!

230
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,180
No way!

231
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,420
My house is over there.

232
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,340
What?

233
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,740
What?

234
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,520
That's the high-rise apartment!

235
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,040
Where did you get that money?

236
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,380
The neighbors next door gave me a lot of money to live with.

237
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,520
I love expensive places.

238
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,340
No.

239
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,600
He's not even attached to me.

240
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,220
What?

241
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,740
What?

242
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,000
What?

243
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,960
What?

244
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,500
No, I didn't rent it.

245
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,140
What?

246
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,620
No, I didn't.

247
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,140
No, I didn't.

248
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,740
No, I didn't.

249
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,720
Oh, no.

250
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,860
I'm sorry!

251
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,260
I don't have any, either.

252
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,320
Stop doing that.

253
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,820
Kankichi!

254
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,780
What happened, Kankichi?

255
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,160
Stop it!

256
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,180
Stop it!

257
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,220
Stop it!

258
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,360
Yeah.

259
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,960
Who's that?

260
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,680
What's with the long hair?

261
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,680
The man next door likes cooking.

262
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,700
I'll make him eat Indian curry later.

263
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,340
Cheers.

264
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,500
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

265
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,120
Hey, Mottou.

266
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,580
Yeah.

267
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,760
Can I borrow a Lacrosse racket?

268
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
Mine's from Ikarijima.

269
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,180
Oh, don't bring it to me, Mottou.

270
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,520
That old man has a Lacrosse racket.

271
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,660
Kansan, you're not going home.

272
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,280
Good work.

273
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,380
Leave it here.

274
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,240
Can't you lock the door?

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,140
I've never locked a door in my life.

276
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,520
First, I forgot where I left it.

277
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,680
You're too careless living alone.

278
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm not.

279
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm free to go out like Nagaya.

280
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,820
I don't think Nagaya is safe.

281
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,300
Don't say that.

282
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,780
What if you get caught?

283
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
I'll be fine.

284
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Thank you.

285
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,420
Thank you.

286
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,480
That's cheap.

287
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,620
I won't.

288
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,820
That's the problem.

289
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,880
You can buy it at the market.

290
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,660
What?

291
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,180
The horizontal route.

292
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,320
Right.

293
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:40,820
I want to travel to the from Anna and Kansai.

294
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,600
Wait a minute.

295
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:41,980
We're going to do a trip there.

296
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,340
From here, why would you do it?

297
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,520
It's too gentle.

298
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,900
Who's there?

299
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,660
From here, I'm going.

300
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,720
I've never seen a game like this before.

301
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,460
Of course.

302
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,760
This is the new game software I made.

303
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,060
What? You made a game software?

304
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,740
Alright, I'll try it.

305
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,660
If you want to play, I'll charge you 1,000 yen.

306
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,060
You're such a big-ass old man.

307
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,500
No!

308
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,120
No!

309
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,100
I'll just serve you a beer and a snack.

310
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,660
Let's see...

311
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,120
Yakiyami...

312
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:39,500
It's pretty good.

313
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,540
I'm done with the bug-tripping.

314
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,300
I just need to sell it.

315
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,020
It smells bad.

316
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,560
Really?

317
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,200
You're taking too much of my time.

318
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,740
Hey, Kanta! Kanta! Kanta!

319
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,840
Kanta!

320
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,580
I'm Kankichi!

321
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,420
I finally woke up.

322
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,380
What is this?

323
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,580
I was tied up by that thief earlier.

324
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,340
The Entire Tome of the Land...

325
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,220
The Entire Time of the Land?

326
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,500
You're not hurt, revil?

327
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,700
I'm fine...

328
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,260
Besides, I've stolen something precious to me.

329
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,140
Something more precious than my life.

330
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,540
Damn it...

331
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,520
I'mashiro Haya...

332
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,780
What?

333
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,600
A plum!

334
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,540
Uh-oh.

335
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:44,960
Uh-oh.

336
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
So, they just hung up.

337
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,720
That doesn't scare me.

338
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,520
Just who do we lock them in?

339
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,640
Kajira!

340
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,460
Someone get in!

341
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,240
You won't get any!

342
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,240
This place is completely blue!

343
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,340
There's no point in doing this, let's just leave it there.

344
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,160
Roger!

345
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,740
carton!

346
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,440
Roger, Roger...

347
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,020
What an idiot!

348
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,160
You're acting too strong!

349
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,680
I'm back!

350
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,560
I can't move my legs!

351
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
The fire will make it worse!

352
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,280
Where is the fire extinguisher?

353
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,220
You have to buy a fire extinguisher four days before a computer!

354
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,740
I can't take it!

355
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Huh?

356
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,720
Whoa! A cockroach!

357
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,720
Whoa!

358
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,460
Whoa! A cockroach!

359
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,880
I thought I was dead.

360
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,620
I'm relieved.

361
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,520
You're being too kind!

362
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
Hurry up, Ginpei!

363
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,280
Just hold on!

364
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
I'm putting a lot of pressure on you, Chouji!

365
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:04,900
Hey!

366
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,500
Hold on! Hold on!

367
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,160
You're using me as a cover!

368
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,880
There he is!

369
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,920
I found the culprit!

370
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,860
All right! Let's go after him!

371
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,940
Wait! This way is faster!

372
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,120
The apartments in the basement are quite well-placed.

373
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,900
What?

374
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,620
Skydiving!

375
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,360
Poor Ryosuke!

376
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,200
Digit Tracing!

377
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,240
Hey!

378
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,080
Hey!

379
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,840
You're going to fall asleep faster than an elevator!

380
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,920
You want to kill me?

381
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,660
You're going to run to Tsumiyoshi Shrine, aren't you?

382
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,160
Damn it!

383
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,080
I'll catch you!

384
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,660
You idiot!

385
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,620
There's a shortcut.

386
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,080
What?

387
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,280
Isn't it too narrow?

388
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,200
It's easy for one person, but it's hard for two.

389
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,480
You idiot!

390
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,180
You're going to die!

391
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,360
You're going to die!

392
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,560
Did something happen?

393
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,740
I did my best.

394
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,980
Don't go sideways.

395
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,680
Go vertically.

396
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,180
I see.

397
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,600
Ouch!

398
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,940
It hurts, Kazuo!

399
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,420
Shut up!

400
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,880
Damn it!

401
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,700
Wait! Give me my gold!

402
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,340
Where's the guy who told me to wait?

403
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,140
Idiot!

404
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,100
What are you talking about?

405
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,420
You're going to die!

406
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,760
You're going to die!

407
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,020
You're going to die!

408
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,280
You're going to die!

409
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,340
You're going to die!

410
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,380
I'll leave that thief alone!

411
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,420
I don't even know where the gold is!

412
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,140
What are you talking about, Kanta?

413
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,620
There are many memories of the old man and the old woman in the safe.

414
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,160
I can't live without that!

415
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,260
I can't live without that!

416
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,460
Is it a very important memory that this old man is so particular about?

417
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,720
I understand! I understand! I understand!

418
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,080
You just have to catch me!

419
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,480
You just have to catch me!

420
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,520
Kanta...

421
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,580
I understood you.

422
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,660
You're just like that!

423
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,820
You're like that!

424
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,480
You're a stick!

425
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,920
You're a stick!

426
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,580
You're a stick!

427
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,180
You're a stick!

428
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,680
That's right!

429
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm saved!

430
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm saved!

431
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,380
Please, untie me!

432
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,480
What's wrong, Kanta?

433
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,120
The thief killed me.

434
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,820
It's a horrible tragedy.

435
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,340
That's right!

436
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,800
By the way, the racket I borrowed this time was pretty good.

437
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,860
I see.

438
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,520
I see. That's good.

439
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,200
If we don't hurry, we'll lose the thief!

440
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Don't worry.

441
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:17,220
Go, Shinden Bulldog!

442
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
You even had this?

443
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,900
To escape from this Tsukuda Island,

444
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,620
we must cross Aioi Bridge, Kachidoki Bridge, Tsukida Bridge, and the Chuo Bridge.

445
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,260
He's somewhere on the back of the bridge.

446
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,840
I'll catch him!

447
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:51,160
There he is!

448
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,180
Don't underestimate my lightning skill!

449
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,540
Run this thing!

450
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,320
W- Wait a second!

451
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,960
Kansarou, are you all right?

452
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,180
W- why not?

453
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,340
How many times do I have to kill you?

454
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,900
That's absolute nonsense.

455
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,680
I almost forgot that there's a chainsaw at that bridge.

456
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,440
Huh?

457
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,760
Kinpei, he's running away!

458
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,120
Wait up!

459
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,620
They're persistent.

460
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,260
That means he's a pretty good sleeper.

461
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,680
Hey, give me back my wallet!

462
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,700
Don't come near me!

463
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,400
Wait!

464
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,640
Wait!

465
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,100
What the hell are you doing?

466
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
Stop!

467
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,760
You idiot!

468
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
Damn you!

469
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,420
Get out of my way!

470
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,840
If you don't, I'll tear this place down!

471
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,120
Understood?

472
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,720
I-I won't let you do that.

473
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm begging you!

474
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,280
You bastard!

475
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,300
The safe!

476
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:45,600
Thank you for your hard work!

477
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,820
Take this.

478
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,720
Thank goodness!

479
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,940
Thank you, Mr. Yuka!

480
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,000
Just in case, you should go back inside.

481
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,180
Wh-wh-what is this?!

482
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,160
This game software is really hard to get right now.

483
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,240
Thank you, Kazuo!

484
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,440
Huh?

485
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,780
This is a model of the the memory siemprezation box of your grandma!

486
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,480
S-sorry, my grandma and I used to play this game software when we were kids.

487
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,720
I played it a lot!

488
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,520
A hundred years ago, there was such a thing!!

489
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,960
You fucking liar!

490
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,980
Aaaaaahhhhhh!

491
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,100
F coisa!!

492
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,600
Damn it. You guys are out of your mind.

493
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,640
You loser!

494
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,300
I won't come back to you.

495
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,420
Listen up, everyone.

496
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,140
I'm on behalf of the lady from the hot spring trip.

497
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,860
I will be closely taking care of them, and from now on, I'll do my best to help you work the land nine-toed.

498
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,460
Please, remember that I told you, I'll do my best to protect you.

499
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,360
Next time, you will be wouldn't welcome alone, but I do.

500
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,260
See you then!

501
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,040
I have a lot of things I want to do

502
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:50,980
I want to run through the vast desert on my bike

503
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,160
I want to be freer than a bird

504
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,900
I want to be freer than a bird

505
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:07,620
A lady's dream changes at the speed of light

506
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm sorry, my love, I lost

507
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:22,280
The future of the panorama is a dazzling light

508
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,140
I want to be freer than a bird

509
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,560
You understand, right?

510
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm sorry, wait for me
