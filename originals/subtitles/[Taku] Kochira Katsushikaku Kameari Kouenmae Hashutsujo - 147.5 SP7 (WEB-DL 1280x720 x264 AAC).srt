1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,100
"Gacha"

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,980
It's like someone's calling me

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,420
After the rain

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,960
I walked while looking back

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,040
"Gacha, hold my hand!"

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,700
At that time, I felt

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,820
A strange feeling

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,980
So I walked on the Ake-do-gai's

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,820
Black tile

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,280
I saw

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,780
Everyone was a child once

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,640
But everyone forgets

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,600
Politicians with a great face

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,440
And a blue aunt above their eyes

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,100
Turn around and look

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,980
"Ake-do-gai"

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,100
How about that?

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,120
You'll see everyone

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,000
Over there is Kame-Ari

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,300
Ah, Kitto Kame-Ari

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,120
Everyone come to our town

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,220
Thank you!

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,260
What? A date?

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,300
Shin, don't make a loud noise.

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,780
This is a change of mood again.

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,580
So, who is your partner?

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460
That's it. He is super handsome.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,160
I see. Komachi is a handsome guy.

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,920
So, how do you feel when you compare him to a talent?

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,280
That's right.

31
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,240
Kim Takuta added Sorimachi and Kaneshiro.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,620
And he divided them by three.

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,920
And he added Takky.

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,020
In short...

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,860
Both are Kanjichi.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,420
Don't underestimate me.

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,400
Joke. Just a joke.

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,600
There is a limit to jokes.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,560
Sorry.

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,940
Anyway, take advantage of this chance.

42
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,820
Whatever it is...

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,580
Whatever it is, you are absolutely against it.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,340
What?

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:18,940
You can't say no.

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,840
What?

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,660
Why are you against it?

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,600
What do you mean, Komachi?

49
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,120
No matter how much you are the chief, you don't want to interfere with my meeting.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
We were talking about Ryosu's trip to America.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,520
What?

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,940
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,480
Komachi, let's go.

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,160
Excuse me.

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,340
Wait a minute.

56
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,420
Ryosu and Kanjichi said they were going to America for training.

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,020
Yes.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,220
They were invited to a two-week training from New York City.

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,800
What?

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
Why are they invited by a wild gorilla?

61
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,700
Bakuryu, a good friend of Ryosu, is a best friend of the chief of New York City.

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
The chief asked him about Ryosu.

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,420
He said he wanted to invite Ryosu.

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,760
So I was against it.

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,220
He is the Japanese police's shame.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,540
You don't have to go to America and expose his shame.

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
I think we should let him go.

68
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,380
What?

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,960
If Ryosu and Kanjichi are gone for two weeks,

70
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,420
even then, the Katsushika prefecture, no,

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,280
the whole country will be peaceful and quiet.

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,060
I see.

73
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,880
I see.

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,740
But, Ohara, this is a decision.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,780
I'm begging you.

76
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,480
Please educate Ryosu.

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,040
Please let him go to America without any shame.

78
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,360
Yes.

79
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,720
I'll try to do what I can.

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,960
Mr. Ryosu is going to America.

81
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,860
Hey, Ryosu!

82
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,200
Ouch!

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't sleep!

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,060
Please let me sleep.

85
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,700
Please let me sleep.

86
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,100
I want to expose the shame of the Japanese police to America.

87
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,980
Ouch!

88
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,940
Nakagawa, water.

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,720
Yes.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,180
This is terrible.

91
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,360
We stayed up all night studying about America for three days.

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,840
What?

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Then, show us where the American capital is.

94
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,100
Well, I think it's around here.

95
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
That's Los Angeles.

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,600
I thought so.

97
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,400
Well, the capital is New York.

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,540
It's Washington.

99
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,060
When did you change?

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,800
Idiot!

101
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,160
I studied for three nights and nights.

102
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,740
You are such a...

103
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,320
Chief, calm down!

104
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,520
If you get too excited, your blood pressure will rise again.

105
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,860
Oh, I see.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,960
Well, it's just exaggeration to go to America.

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,940
Shut up!

108
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,260
You're a loser and rude to money.

109
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,780
You can't even speak English at all.

110
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,560
Do you know what will happen if you go to America?

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,720
What?

112
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,760
What will happen?

113
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,820
You'll be carried by the dynamite.

114
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,620
You'll be thrown into a fire.

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,820
That's a good thing.

116
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,860
Why are you laughing?

117
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,820
If you do something bad, you can't even fight America.

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,200
Right?

119
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,300
Chief?

120
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,120
My stomach hurts.

121
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,700
Reiko, give me some medicine and water.

122
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,780
Yes.

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,940
Dr. Sato takes care their stomachs.

124
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm going to have to be careful.

125
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,940
Good.

126
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,380
I want to take this with me to America.

127
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,540
What?

128
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,320
He'll be replaced very soon.

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,200
I've already told Mr. Sato.

130
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,200
I could not tell him he would regret it.

131
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,400
All right.

132
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,560
Thank you very much.

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,760
Water tower? Why do we have to put such a thing?

134
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,020
The plane ticket for the return and the hotel stay are free,

135
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,920
but the other expenses are all the cost of the Katsushika office.

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
What? It's quite troublesome.

137
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I wonder if I'll go to Hawaii with just money.

138
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,340
What did you say?

139
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm kidding. I'll go there properly.

140
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,640
The next day

141
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,600
I've finished all the procedures for the return.

142
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,700
Here's the ticket and passport.

143
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,940
Oh, sorry.

144
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,180
And this is the trunk.

145
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,900
Hey, hey, are you bringing such a big thing?

146
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,320
Because it's for two weeks.

147
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,840
This is the one that I made small.

148
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,320
Show me. There are so many unnecessary things in it.

149
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,940
Oh, I don't need to change clothes.

150
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,340
I don't need a camera. I don't need medicine.

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,260
I don't need this either. What's this? I don't need this either.

152
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,980
I don't need this either.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
I don't need this either.

154
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,040
This is enough.

155
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,740
And this, and this, and this.

156
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,540
Why do you bring English words and ballpoint pens?

157
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,200
American kids are more addicted to computers and TV games than Japanese kids.

158
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,360
I thought I'd teach them a nostalgic Japanese game.

159
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,920
It's like Ryo-chan.

160
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,800
That's fine.

161
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
But why do you bring souvenirs to the president of the New York City Court?

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,140
And a note of the English conversation that Reiko made for us.

163
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,980
And a note of the English conversation that Reiko made for us.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,620
I'll give your letter to him.

165
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't like it. I'm bad at using things.

166
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Hey, hold it.

167
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,060
Hold it like this.

168
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,180
It's done.

169
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,680
You've forgotten about the changing paper from Director Nonda, right?

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

171
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,380
That's right. It's all right.

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,860
So, you want me to hold it?

173
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,180
Yes, I do.

174
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,380
I know.

175
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,100
Yes, I do.

176
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,480
referee Ryo Stsukan in New York City is now going to New York City.

177
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,820
We are departing to the capital!

178
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,520
Finally, we have survived.

179
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,740
Don't worry. Senpai has a strong vitality.

180
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,700
Even when we went to Africa and the 8-minute island, we came back safely.

181
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,440
Come back safely, Yotsu.

182
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,820
I can't eat anymore.

183
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,560
Finally we arrived.

184
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:52,580
I said I would come to the airport, but no one came.

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,720
What is this music?

186
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,840
Who would do such a thing?

187
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,560
Idiot! Stop!

188
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,200
Yotsu, it's been a while.

189
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
As I thought, Captain Bugryu!

190
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,420
What are you planning?

191
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,020
What are you angry about?

192
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,780
You welcomed us.

193
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,120
What?

194
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,460
You welcomed me?

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Welcome to New York.

196
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,940
You can't do that in a short time.

197
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,000
I knew you would die.

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,500
Hi, Ryo.

199
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,860
Hey, Johnny. You are here too.

200
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,300
Long time no see.

201
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,400
I knew you would welcome me.

202
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,520
New York is divided into five countries.

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,060
Manhattan

204
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,960
Brooklyn

205
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,960
Queens

206
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,460
Bronx

207
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,200
Staten Island

208
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,460
Where is the 57th station I'm going to?

209
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,060
Manhattan Island with the Matenro.

210
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,540
I'll introduce you.

211
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,400
What?

212
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,880
The 57th station in New York City, where you will be taken care of while you are staying.

213
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,640
It's Max.

214
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,580
Oh, I see.

215
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,920
My name is Ryo.

216
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,900
This is the great famous policeman, Japan's President.

217
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
Japan's President.

218
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,940
Japan's President.

219
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,020
Your English seems a bit faster than mine.

220
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,440
It's true.

221
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,280
I'll tell you the truth.

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:31,900
What?

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
I hate Japanese.

224
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,740
Don't talk to me in a way you like if you don't have to.

225
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,580
Oh, what?

226
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,420
No way!

227
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:38,960
Why not?

228
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,560
Max lost his grandfather during the Pacific War.

229
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,880
Don't give me this nonsense.

230
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,580
What do you mean you didn't lose each other?

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,780
We have been completely burned out by the city below our living condition.

232
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,260
You don't have a choice.

233
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,140
R-Right.

234
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,200
Let's go.

235
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,980
Yotsu, do you have a place you want to go before you go to the 57th station?

236
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,140
Eh? Is that okay?

237
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,340
Then, if I have to go to New York, it's the Statue of Liberty!

238
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Alright!

239
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,340
Whoa! As expected, it's really awesome!

240
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,020
I want to go to New York!

241
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Whoa! I came here!

242
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,880
I wanted to try this when I came to New York!

243
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,520
I didn't know! It feels great!

244
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,280
It's a good place to climb, too.

245
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,340
The rural yellow monkey!

246
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,140
We'll be there in a little while!

247
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,740
Whoa! Beautiful! As expected, New York is different!

248
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,380
The scale is different from the high-rise buildings in Shinjuku!

249
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,720
Ryo, it's dangerous to start riding too much!

250
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,880
Dad!

251
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,640
Ryo!

252
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:52,980
I missed!

253
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't worry. We're on Hudson River.

254
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,180
The 57th station is right up ahead.

255
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,020
We'll be waiting for you there!

256
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,080
Hey! Help!

257
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,300
Colonel, is it okay if I don't help?

258
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,780
His vitality is more than five times that of a monkey.

259
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't worry.

260
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,720
Max, your Ryo-sensei...

261
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,140
If you follow him, you'll know his good qualities.

262
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,200
Hey, Sire!

263
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,340
Colonel Dark Dragon!

264
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,120
You remember me!

265
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
Oh, great!

266
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,780
Your souvenir.

267
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,640
The president is very pleased.

268
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,260
Of course. It's a replica, though.

269
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,460
Thank you very much, Mr. Ryo-tsu.

270
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,700
Thank you very much, Mr. Ryo-tsu.

271
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:52,860
I'm sure he'll like it.

272
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,580
Today, you can take a rest at the hotel.

273
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,040
Let's start training tomorrow.

274
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,800
Of course.

275
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,900
Colonel, Jody, thank you for today.

276
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,980
You're welcome.

277
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm home during the break.

278
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,380
If you need anything, feel free to call.

279
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,360
Oh, thank you!

280
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,380
Avenge your army!

281
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,940
Oh, thanks to you, New York.

282
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,700
So big.

283
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
Oh, hey, stop.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
What is it?

285
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,980
I found a shop at G.I. Joe's.

286
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,100
Shopping?

287
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,240
Oh, there's a Godzilla character shop.

288
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,980
I'm gonna take a shopping trip, so wait a second.

289
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,280
Hey!

290
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,600
Damn you!

291
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,680
You're gonna go on a sightseeing vacation?

292
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,500
Hey, shut up!

293
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,340
I'll be here at 9 tomorrow, so wake up and wait for me.

294
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,300
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow, too.

295
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,120
The chief will get angry if I don't put on the water bottle cap properly.

296
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,920
The special version of G.I. Joe, and the American version of Godzilla, and also...

297
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,840
Ah, stop it already! Why do you have to put on a water bottle cap like your husband?

298
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,340
Huh? Ah, it's money!

299
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,080
What? A list of souvenirs?

300
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,040
Are you telling me to buy it with this money?

301
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,960
You're mistaking me for a import company, aren't you?

302
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,440
I can't do it.

303
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,080
Huh?

304
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,840
What? I slept well.

305
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,040
Hi, Max.

306
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,600
Huh?

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,240
Hi, Sunday.

308
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,920
Hey, you're a pretty sister.

309
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,940
Hurry up and get on.

310
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,560
Is it your sister you were talking about?

311
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,660
I'm Saishimochi. Don't ask me unnecessary questions.

312
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Yes, yes, I understand.

313
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,120
I don't have any other opinions.

314
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,220
Huh?

315
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,800
Whoa, that's awesome!

316
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,200
As expected of New York, the prison of crime.

317
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,340
The police are not enough, no matter how many lives they have.

318
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,260
This is different from Japan.

319
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,840
The reason why Japan's security is good is because it's obvious that ordinary people don't have guns.

320
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,180
That's why.

321
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,900
That's why even a guy like you is a police officer.

322
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,380
You know what? From now on, you'll change your clothes more than a week.

323
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,840
You're going to be...

324
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,140
What's wrong with that guy?

325
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
It's a robbery!

326
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,020
What?

327
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,100
Don't move!

328
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,580
If you move, I'll shoot you!

329
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,100
Put your hands on your head!

330
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,560
As usual, you're great.

331
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:13,640
You're great.

332
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,640
Max!

333
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,900
Leave the rest to me.

334
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,900
Wow, that's a really rough arrest.

335
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,720
It's over.

336
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,800
Thanks.

337
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,320
Oh, it's that girl from before!

338
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,160
This is Zebra Six.

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,440
I was in the alley at 52nd street and arrested Mike Goat in the current second half.

340
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,740
You're the Japanese policeman who came to the training, right?

341
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,240
I'm Sandy. Nice to meet you.

342
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm Ryo Tsukankichi. Nice to meet you.

343
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,220
Max, why don't you two come to my house tonight?

344
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,320
I'll treat you to dinner.

345
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,460
Oh, I don't mind.

346
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
What? Really?

347
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Yes. Then, I'll see you at 7 o'clock tonight.

348
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,980
Be sure to come.

349
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,860
Yeah!

350
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,740
This is Harlem.

351
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,440
Huh? What is this place?

352
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,220
Harlem?

353
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,320
I thought it was a place where pretty girls gather.

354
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,640
But it's just a bunch of people with bad taste.

355
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,740
Tourists, you should come in.

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,380
I'll beat you up.

357
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,300
It's just a small place.

358
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,840
Hey!

359
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,660
You bastard!

360
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm not coming to you!

361
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,160
Get out!

362
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,040
You even hit the bus.

363
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
It's a big deal.

364
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,220
It's a real crime scene.

365
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
Oh, the building is on fire!

366
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,860
Hey, it's a fire!

367
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,920
You're the one who set the fire on purpose.

368
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,000
You're supposed to help the fire department.

369
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,900
Huh?

370
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,060
You do it well.

371
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,620
So the firefighters won't come here either.

372
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,420
But what if it's a real fire?

373
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,100
Huh?

374
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,400
Oh!

375
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,480
There's someone in the fire!

376
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,480
Hey, stop!

377
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,400
Really?

378
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,160
I didn't see it.

379
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,380
It's true!

380
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,480
Hey!

381
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,340
I knew it!

382
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,000
Hey!

383
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,020
Don't you have any water?

384
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,520
No water!

385
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,220
I can't do it.

386
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,980
Huh?

387
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,920
It's too late to burn that much.

388
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,000
Stop!

389
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,280
Are you going to die?

390
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:22,960
What...

391
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,880
What are you going to do, Kamikazem?

392
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,860
Hey!

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,520
Use this water to extinguish the fire!

394
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,360
He's going to die!

395
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,160
What are you going to do?

396
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,840
Yeah!

397
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,320
He's alive!

398
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,420
Are you OK?

399
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,800
Oh, That's great!

400
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,280
You're this old woman's husband?

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Yes!

402
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,460
That's great, old woman!

403
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,560
Thank you so much.

404
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,560
What a favor to beg you, Yala.

405
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,740
Don't mention it.

406
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,640
It seems you're dressed nicely, huh?

407
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,540
If you didn't help me, you would be in trouble now.

408
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,440
What? You want me to pay you back?

409
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,280
What?

410
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,220
What?

411
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,060
I didn't know there was a policeman like you in Japan.

412
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,020
You're pretty good too.

413
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,220
I'm not a policeman.

414
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,940
I didn't expect Max, who hated Japanese people so much, to get along with Mr. Ryo-tsu like this.

415
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,760
Ryo-chan is special. He's a real man.

416
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Ryo-chan?

417
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,960
Yes, Ryo-chan.

418
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,440
Oh, you came with Ryo-chan?

419
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,720
Okay, I'll call you Ma-chan.

420
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,320
Ma-chan? That's good.

421
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,620
I like you.

422
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,940
Bye, Ryo-chan.

423
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
Okay, I'm a loser.

424
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,860
A pervert.

425
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,720
You're not a pervert. You're a pervert.

426
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,380
I'm not a pervert.

427
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,080
Look at this.

428
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,520
Look!

429
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,460
Oh, my God!

430
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,340
This is Japanese pervert dancing.

431
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,380
Ryo-chan is great.

432
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,680
I've never met him before.

433
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,040
I don't know if I can do it myself or not.

434
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,480
How should I name you, Mr. Ryo-chan?

435
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,220
Mr. Ryo-chan.

436
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,060
At present, Mr. Ryo-chan is your tengo.

437
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,400
Next, more than just a teddy bear.

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,240
Mr. Kato.

439
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,740
Nice to meet you.

440
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,620
Nice to meet you too.

441
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,560
Oh, nice to meet you too.

442
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,040
But, what's the matter, Ma-chan?

443
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,060
Actually,

444
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,600
Huh?

445
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,360
I'm going to escort that boy

446
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,120
who's with Sandy

447
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,960
to Los Angeles.

448
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,560
I see. You've done a lot of work

449
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,900
until today.

450
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm grateful.

451
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,620
I had a lot of fun, too.

452
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,020
Enjoy New York until you get back.

453
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,940
Sandy, shall we go?

454
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,080
Yes.

455
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,240
Let's go, John.

456
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,000
John,

457
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,940
we're going to Los Angeles for a long time.

458
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,220
Let's get along.

459
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,660
Come on, John.

460
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,080
Max, Sandy,

461
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,640
if you ever come to Japan,

462
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,520
please visit me anytime.

463
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,760
I'll be very happy.

464
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,440
See you.

465
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,660
What's that?

466
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,020
Max, he's being targeted with a rifle!

467
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,400
What?

468
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,080
Max!

469
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,880
Sandy, hide!

470
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,640
John! Max!

471
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,520
R-Ryo...

472
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,340
The criminal...

473
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,740
Okay, arrest him immediately!

474
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Yes! Sandy, it's an ambulance!

475
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:22,880
Okay!

476
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,500
Max, hang in there!

477
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,980
Ryo...

478
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,640
Hey, don't talk anymore!

479
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,340
I'm fine.

480
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,240
But I have a favor to ask.

481
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,000
What is it?

482
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,300
The one who shot me is a member of the Mafia.

483
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,940
Mafia?

484
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,640
I'm sure they were aiming at John's life.

485
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,540
They were aiming at saving Sandy

486
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,180
Would you take John with you to Los Angeles?

487
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,580
All right, I got it!

488
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,960
I told you not to talk anymore!

489
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I thought Ryo would take the leading role.

490
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,460
Max!

491
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm okay.

492
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,320
I just slept under the magic water.

493
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,920
Okay, I get that.

494
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm sure Ryo Tsukakichi

495
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,440
will definitely bring John to Los Angeles.

496
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:15,700
I'm sure he will.

497
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,980
I have to do something!

498
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,680
Episode 1 The

499
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,500
King of the Mafia

500
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,040
Even so, who is this man who is aiming to kill the mafia?

501
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,640
An important trump card to make the mafia's boss, Don Castanino, the one who has power over the whole of America, guilty.

502
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,360
A trump card?

503
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,660
Don Castanino killed his parents and siblings.

504
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,180
What?

505
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,500
His father is a informant.

506
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,860
He told the police about Castanino's drug dealings, and thanks to that, we were able to arrest a lot of the mafia.

507
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,000
As a revenge, John's family...

508
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,540
Yes.

509
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:13,060
At the time of his mother's death, before Castanino and his family came to us, John was the only one who hid in the closet and escaped from the crisis.

510
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,940
He was wrong.

511
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,160
Do it!

512
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,140
Our others were in terrible trouble.

513
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,140
Later, Castanino was arrested for another crime.

514
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,940
But for the John family's murder, he didn't feel concerned about what happened.

515
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,280
I didn't know John was watching.

516
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,180
I see. So he's an important witness.

517
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,800
Then, if John witnesses the fact that the Castanians ordered to kill his family,

518
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,040
he can be accused of guilty?

519
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,080
Yes. The trial will be held in the court of law in Los Angeles in three days.

520
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,820
Three days.

521
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,100
Four days.

522
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,780
All right, the fuel is ready.

523
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,520
Anytime.

524
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,940
Mister, have a nice trip.

525
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,340
America is a good country.

526
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:26,840
Bye.

527
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,560
Checkmate King 2

528
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,800
Hello, this is Checkmate King 2.

529
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,820
My name is Kankechi Ryotsu. I'm John's family...

530
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm going to take you to Los Angeles to avenge your family.

531
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,220
I'm done for.

532
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm done for.

533
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,140
I wonder if my English is not working.

534
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,260
That's true, but John was shocked that his family was killed,

535
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,660
so he couldn't speak.

536
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,980
He couldn't speak? He couldn't speak at all?

537
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,120
Yes.

538
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,400
Poor thing.

539
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,840
I see.

540
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
Um, Sandy, what do you call a toy in English?

541
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,080
Toy.

542
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,940
John, it's a Japanese toy.

543
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,620
Watch carefully.

544
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:39,920
What?

545
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,580
Well, how's that?

546
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,920
Good, isn't it?

547
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,700
Hey, you try it too.

548
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:46,920
Uh.

549
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,360
John, what are you doing?

550
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,140
Ryo is your ally.

551
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,020
Take off your knife.

552
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
Uh, oh.

553
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,460
Geez, American kids are not cute.

554
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,720
Ryo, forgive him.

555
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,780
I was in the same situation when I first met him.

556
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,910
Adults are all enemies.

557
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,510
I think he's an enemy.

558
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,550
Hmm, well, it's not impossible.

559
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,910
But why did you go to Los Angeles by car?

560
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,590
The plane is faster and safer.

561
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,990
Kennedy Airport, of course.

562
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,110
The airport near New York, the heliport, and the railway stations.

563
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,090
I heard that Don Castanino's assistants were in a mess.

564
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,150
I see.

565
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,810
Of course, in order to hide John's mouth,

566
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,930
he's a child of the island.

567
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,510
Yes.

568
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,150
It takes three days to Los Angeles,

569
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,070
but it's better to disguise like this

570
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,870
and pick up a child-and-child traveler

571
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,510
so that they don't notice.

572
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,010
Yes.

573
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,710
What's wrong?

574
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,190
I thought they wouldn't notice,

575
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,270
but it didn't seem to go that way.

576
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,590
Look behind you.

577
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,210
Huh?

578
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,050
Ah, the trouble is that he came here.

579
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,410
He's trapped.

580
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,710
Hmm.

581
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:07,970
Ah!

582
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:08,590
Ah!

583
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,130
Ah!

584
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,570
Ah!

585
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,110
Ah!

586
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,990
Ah!

587
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,010
Ah!

588
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:22,790
Ah!

589
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,890
He can't go back.

590
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,730
What should he do?

591
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,090
Ah!

592
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,810
Ah!

593
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,630
Ah!

594
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,230
Ah!

595
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,810
Ah!

596
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,070
Ah!

597
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,990
Oh, no!

598
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,230
He's going to be pressed completely.

599
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,170
Good.

600
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:34,610
Joe?

601
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,050
Hey!

602
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,190
What are you doing?

603
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:37,610
Ugh!

604
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,110
Damn it!

605
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,990
What a jerk.

606
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,690
Ah!

607
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,450
Joe!

608
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,630
Don't make a fuss.

609
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,330
I'm not tired of the fact that

610
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,030
Ryo-kun is so stubborn.

611
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,730
Gya!

612
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,030
Gya!

613
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,730
Gya!

614
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,330
What the hell!?

615
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,230
Hey, Ryo!

616
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,010
Ryo, where are you?

617
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,870
What's wrong?

618
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,090
My God!

619
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,290
Are you okay, Sande?

620
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,990
Ryo, you're okay, right?

621
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,710
I'm in this car!

622
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,170
I'll open the road, so accelerate at once!

623
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,890
Okay!

624
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,590
Alright!

625
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,430
Sande!

626
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,470
Now!

627
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,230
Okay!

628
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,190
Alright!

629
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,810
Sande!

630
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,470
Alright! Next is the one behind you!

631
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,390
What's wrong?

632
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,090
Let me go!

633
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,330
Sad 비룡

634
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,630
Ryo!

635
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,850
Hey, I'm here!

636
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:12,910
What?

637
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,810
Ryo!!

638
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,370
I'm okay.

639
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,510
I lost my sandal, though.

640
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,770
That's great!

641
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,070
Seriously!

642
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,530
This is no good.

643
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:24,830
Mikazeme!

644
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,590
No good.

645
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,410
Not only the body, but the engine is also destroyed.

646
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,050
It can't be helped.

647
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,350
Let's leave this car here and rent a rental car.

648
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,250
Where are we going to rent a rental car?

649
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,810
The town is stupid.

650
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,890
I can't see a single house.

651
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,310
I'm going to hitchhike and go to the nearest town and rent it.

652
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,790
Hitchhike?

653
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,110
Oh, here it comes.

654
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,090
Hide in the shadow of the car.

655
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,450
Why?

656
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,990
If you're a child, the car won't stop for you.

657
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,410
I see.

658
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,550
Hey!

659
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,130
Come on!

660
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,790
I want you to put it on!

661
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,730
It's so powerful.

662
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,650
You're a child!

663
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,290
Oh, it's gone.

664
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,050
I'm bored until Sandy comes back.

665
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,270
Corn seeds?

666
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,370
A net for evading birds?

667
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,670
I have a good idea!

668
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,150
John!

669
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:46,870
Lend me a knife!

670
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,590
A knife!

671
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,630
Thank you.

672
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,170
How is it? Is it interesting?

673
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,770
John, get the net over there.

674
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,290
Net, net. There's a net for bird's nest in the field over there.

675
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,130
Take it and make it a little deeper.

676
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,430
Like this, like this.

677
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,790
Okay, it's done.

678
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,850
John, there's a newspaper and a tape on the dashboard of the car, so please bring it.

679
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,110
I'll take it.

680
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,930
How is it, John?

681
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,270
The Japanese kite octopus is pretty good, right?

682
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,490
Oh, you like it?

683
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,270
I'm finally here, Sandy.

684
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,270
Hey!

685
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,830
Ryo, I bought sandals, too.

686
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,450
Thank you.

687
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,190
It was fun.

688
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,410
It's okay.

689
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,090
It's a present for you.

690
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,950
You became really close while I was away.

691
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,150
That's right.

692
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,630
Anyway, Sandy, I think you'd better not stop anywhere from now on.

693
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,310
It seems that they already know that we're using this road.

694
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,730
That's right. But it's impossible to drive for three days and then go to school.

695
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,170
If you take a car with me, you'll be able to go non-stop.

696
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,610
Okay!

697
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,650
Let's go home.

698
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,910
Okay.

699
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,770
Goodbye, Sandy.

700
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,250
Bye.

701
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,450
Bye.

702
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,070
Bye.

703
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,070
Good-bye, Sandy.

704
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,430
Bye.

705
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:46,630
Bye.

706
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,730
You have to watch out for the depicted

707
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:58,990
Hahaha.

708
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,590
All right, then.

709
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,090
Good boy.

710
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:16,270
What's wrong, you two?

711
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,670
You haven't eaten anything at all.

712
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,870
I'm tired.

713
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,710
I can't get my appetite back.

714
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,890
Oh, right.

715
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,790
You've been running for more than two days.

716
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,870
I guess you should take a rest somewhere.

717
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,050
I'm sure they haven't noticed that we're moving in a rental car.

718
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,210
You're right.

719
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,390
We're already in California.

720
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,410
If we leave at 1 a.m., we'll be in time before the trial starts.

721
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,170
All right.

722
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,390
When I'm done eating, I'll go look for Negra.

723
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,830
Do you want to eat that chili bean?

724
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,270
Can I have some?

725
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,670
What?

726
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,470
I'm hungry.

727
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,910
I'm hungry.

728
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:52,770
I'm hungry.

729
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,130
All right.

730
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,470
Let's go.

731
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,810
Listen, John.

732
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,750
You're going to sleep here like this.

733
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,170
Then, Sandy will be in the middle.

734
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:22,770
Then, Sandy will be in the middle.

735
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,470
Then, Sandy will be in the middle.

736
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,610
Then, Sandy will be in the middle.

737
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:25,490
Then, Sandy will be in the middle.

738
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,030
Do you understand?

739
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,870
And you don't have to know the reason.

740
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,490
Just go to bed in that order.

741
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,310
And you don't have to know the reason.

742
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,230
If John sleeps, you can choose from Sandy.

743
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,010
If John sleeps, you can choose from Sandy.

744
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,170
If John sleeps, you can choose from Sandy.

745
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:41,290
If John sleeps, you can choose from Sandy.

746
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,290
What's the big problem?

747
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,570
Just go to bed.

748
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,270
Just go to bed.

749
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,450
I'll be back in just a moment.

750
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:49,570
I'll be back in just a moment.

751
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,510
I'll be back in just a moment.

752
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,050
He'll come to guard you until the next hour.

753
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,430
Ah, I see.

754
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,310
Then I guess I'll take a shower or something.

755
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,630
Wait.

756
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,850
Before that, why don't you ask Captain Bakuryuu for help?

757
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:02,890
Huh?

758
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,270
If John tells you the truth,

759
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,330
Don Castanino will be guilty for sure.

760
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,610
The servants will be desperate,

761
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,930
and will come to stop us from entering the path.

762
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,450
I see.

763
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,470
Okay.

764
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,210
Then Sunday, take a shower and wait for me.

765
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,530
Wait for me?

766
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,430
No, no, it's nothing.

767
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,050
I'll call you right away.

768
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,950
Who's that calling at this hour?

769
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,730
It's me, Ryo Scankichi.

770
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,910
Oh, it's you.

771
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,950
What's wrong?

772
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,550
Did something happen?

773
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,690
Sunday!

774
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,270
Damn it!

775
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,370
What are you doing?

776
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,630
Ryo!

777
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,570
Sunday!

778
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,730
John!

779
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,070
Damn it!

780
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,230
Huh?

781
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,770
Damn it!

782
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,250
You made me punk!

783
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,090
Damn it!

784
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,070
John!

785
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:25,950
Sunday!

786
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,430
Ah, I see.

787
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,450
Hello?

788
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,270
Ryo, what's that sound?

789
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,130
I'll tell you later!

790
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,530
Anyway, come with me!

791
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,610
Damn it!

792
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,130
That bastard!

793
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,870
He must have done something!

794
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,570
No doubt he turned his back on us.

795
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,470
It would be better to stand still along the wayside.

796
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,670
Where are you going, ha?

797
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,210
There's a warehouse where we can escape from.

798
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,930
Where on earth did that red bear go?

799
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,970
Where the hell did he go?

800
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,930
The police are watching over him on every street.

801
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,970
He's not going to get out of this town.

802
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,690
Sanze, John, stay safe!

803
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,910
Now, stay still here!

804
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,150
He's not going to get out of this town.

805
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,530
Patracchi's brother said to kill him, but he doesn't have to do it.

806
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,650
I hope he doesn't make it in time for the trial.

807
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,930
I'll leave it to him to do it.

808
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,410
Patracchi's brother said to kill him, but he doesn't have to do it.

809
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,710
You had a knife, didn't you?

810
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,550
There you go.

811
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,730
Okay, I'll borrow it for a while.

812
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:21,330
Patracchi's brother said to kill him, but he doesn't have to do it.

813
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,590
I'll leave it to him to do it.

814
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:22,730
I did it!

815
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,270
Come on, hurry up!

816
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,070
Please.

817
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,650
It won't open any further.

818
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,710
Then it's impossible to escape from there.

819
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:39,390
Then it's impossible to escape from there.

820
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,090
Then it's impossible to escape from there.

821
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:46,590
What if you use an octopus or something?

822
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,450
What?

823
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,450
That?

824
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,910
I see! Good idea, John!

825
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,850
Now! What are the cops doing?

826
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,350
Now we're not going to make it to today's trial!

827
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,090
Now we're not going to make it to today's trial!

828
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:00,790
Oh?

829
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,550
What's that?

830
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,650
It's John!

831
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,050
I made the octopus for John!

832
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:09,110
I made the octopus for John!

833
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,030
I made the octopus for John!

834
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:14,790
I'm here.

835
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,370
Oh, I finally found it.

836
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,270
Colonel, land in a place they don't notice.

837
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,710
Got it.

838
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,270
Hmph. I didn't know I'd be killed in an hour.

839
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,310
You slept well.

840
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,890
It's all right.

841
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,390
After we find that octopus, Ryo will surely come to help us.

842
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,870
He's already here.

843
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,910
Huh? Ryo!

844
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,570
Hmm. Sandy, how many enemies are there?

845
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,870
Two. But there might be more.

846
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,130
All right. There's no time until the trial.

847
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,630
It'll be rough, but I'll help you right away.

848
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,690
Go to that corner and hang on.

849
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,890
Got it.

850
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,830
I'm counting on you!

851
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,510
Okay.

852
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,830
Run!

853
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,350
Wait!

854
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,230
John, this way!

855
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,490
Run! Run!

856
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,830
John!

857
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,670
John!

858
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,790
Don't move!

859
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,650
You bastard!

860
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,010
Don't shoot!

861
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,090
John!

862
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,330
John!

863
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,130
John!

864
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,310
John!

865
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,450
John!

866
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,070
John!

867
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:43,910
John!

868
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,350
You bastard!

869
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,810
I won't forgive you!

870
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,330
Don't move!

871
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,070
Uhhh!

872
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,870
Ugh!

873
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,090
Ugh!

874
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,310
How dare you!

875
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,930
You bastard!

876
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,650
I killed John!

877
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,450
Stop, Ryotsu!

878
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,630
I'm sorry, sir!

879
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,970
I know how you feel, but don't do it anymore.

880
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,270
Damn it!

881
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:20,430
Ryo!

882
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,470
John is alive!

883
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,790
What?

884
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,610
Jo-John!

885
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,190
Why are you...

886
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:35,990
A B-goma?

887
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,150
The B-goma Ryo gave me protected John.

888
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,170
Ryo...

889
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,570
What's wrong, John?

890
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,690
John!

891
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,170
Ryo!

892
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,190
You can speak now?

893
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,910
Thank you, Ryo!

894
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,090
I'm so glad!

895
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,210
I'm so glad!

896
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,690
Judge, we can't wait any longer for the prosecutor's witness.

897
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,950
If the witness is not here, please go to the police station.

898
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,510
If it's the witness, he's here!

899
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:27,750
What?

900
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,150
Judge!

901
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,330
Judge!

902
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,170
I'm sorry to be late, but I'm the witness.

903
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,610
Please allow me to ask you a question.

904
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,010
Hmm...

905
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,030
John, who ordered you to kill your family,

906
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,970
that is, the Wilson family?

907
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,430
Do it!

908
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,810
It's this guy!

909
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,710
What?

910
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,930
No way!

911
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,790
What this kid is saying is a lie!

912
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,990
I'm the one who ordered you to do this!

913
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,350
I'm the one who ordered you to do this!

914
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,170
Hey!

915
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,890
Now the Castaneda family is finished.

916
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,090
Yes, the death row is definitely a mistake.

917
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,830
Well, everyone.

918
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,530
I'm sorry to see you off, even though you're injured.

919
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,130
What?

920
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:30,830
It's a scratch.

921
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,730
John, let's meet again.

922
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:33,810
Yes.

923
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,870
What?

924
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:35,330
What?

925
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,170
Ryo-san, thank you so much!

926
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,090
What am I even grateful for?

927
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,950
Well, three of youってall are OK.

928
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:42,970
Will it be all right to do that?

929
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,270
Okay.

930
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:45,730
What?

931
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,290
No...

932
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,750
W-w-w-what?

933
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,310
Ok, it's my turn.

934
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,230
Hey, Ma-chan's fine!

935
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,370
Come on, you can touch injury.

936
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:00,590
Oh?

937
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:00,690
I see.

938
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,930
Too bad.

939
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,030
See you.

940
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:07,930
Be careful, Ryo.

941
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,630
I'll definitely go to Japan.

942
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,330
Goodbye, Ryo.

943
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,230
Welcome back, Senpai.

944
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,810
Oh, Nakagawa.

945
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:16,650
You look fine.

946
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,170
Of course. I haven't worked for two weeks.

947
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:23,250
Huh? Where are the souvenirs? Did you bring them to the airport?

948
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,270
No, not really.

949
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:30,270
I bought G.I. Joe and American Van Gogh, but I gave them to John.

950
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,050
You didn't buy anything for the director or the chief?

951
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,430
Was it bad?

952
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,630
Reiko took care of me.

953
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:38,630
I see.

954
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,570
Nakagawa, lend me some money.

955
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,830
Welcome back, Ryo.

956
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,530
Chief, I'm back.

957
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,170
Did you have any trouble while I was gone?

958
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,250
Thanks to you, everything went well.

959
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,110
Come back again.

960
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,830
You'll stay in Alaska for about 50 years.

961
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,970
That's a tough joke.

962
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,310
You must have bought souvenirs for the chief.

963
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,190
Of course.

964
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,390
No, I'm in America.

965
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,690
I'll go with you and give everyone souvenirs.

966
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,850
Wait a minute.

967
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,370
G.I. Joe.

968
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:13,570
Show me what you bought.

969
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,390
No.

970
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:16,850
You're suspicious.

971
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,990
The chief had a list of drinks, so I'll take the drinks.

972
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,050
It's a big whiskey.

973
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,830
What?

974
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,330
Hey.

975
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,370
It says, "A manly taste of sake."

976
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,750
It's made in California.

977
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,410
It's made in America.

978
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,270
Why did you buy sake in America?

979
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,190
Show me other souvenirs.

980
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:46,110
I bought a doll for the chief, a camera for the regional chief, and a tea bowl for the chief.

981
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,110
The boss is the boss.

982
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,930
Ta-da.

983
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,690
It's a Hakata obi and a Zori set.

984
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,750
Did you really go to America?

985
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,350
You must have been hiding in Tokyo.

986
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,690
No.

987
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,050
I bought everything in America.

988
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,230
It's a so-called reverse imported product.

989
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,450
It's a really valuable item.

990
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,590
Then I'll ask you.

991
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,710
What does it say in the broadcast paper that it's a New Tokyo International Airport?

992
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:14,370
No.

993
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:14,970
That's wrong.

994
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,370
That's not Tokyo.

995
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,770
It's Tonkin.

996
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,170
I went home to Tonkin, next to Beijing.

997
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,090
So there.

998
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:22,470
So there.

999
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,670
Do you think I'll be fooled by that?

1000
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:25,970
Ryo.

1001
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,830
You didn't even wear a water bottle cap.

1002
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,570
I'm not good at such small things.

1003
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,250
What about the new book that the chief wrote for the chief over there?

1004
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,950
I have it properly.

1005
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:42,970
Idiot.

1006
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,390
It's meaningless if you don't give it to me.

1007
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,550
Wait, Ryo.

1008
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:48,670
Oh.

1009
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,990
I can't study abroad.

1010
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,430
I hate studying abroad.
