1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,360
"I'm sorry!"

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,960
"I'm sorry!"

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,680
"I'm sorry!"

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:10,760
"I'm sorry!"

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,080
"Hey, hey, Mr. Omawari."

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,960
"I want to go to Harajuku, but..."

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,520
"Can you tell me where?"

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,220
"Can you tell me?"

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,900
"Oh, then take the train."

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
"And change trains at Akihabara."

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,300
"It's the second station."

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,640
"Thank you very much, Mr. Omawari."

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,840
"Oh, then I won't go to Harajuku."

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,400
"That's fine."

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,760
"I'm fine. I'm fine."

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,020
"I'm fine. I'm fine."

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,580
"I'm fine. I'm fine."

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,160
"When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away!"

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,500
"When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away!"

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,160
"A man without money."

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,880
"Come to me now."

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,880
"I'm not here either, but I'm worried."

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,400
"Look at the blue sky, See the blue sky,

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,480
and the white clouds!"

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,520
and the white clouds!"

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,660
and the white clouds!"

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,900
"We'll somehow make it somehow somehow!"

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,940
"Whahaha!"

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,320
"Whahaha!"

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,700
"Akane"

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,340
Come to me, you jobless man.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm not here, but don't worry.

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,140
Look, the burning Akane is...

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,700
...will be fine soon.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm sure it'll be fine.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,600
You know what to do, right?

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,180
You know what to do, right?

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,760
If you know what to do, just shut up and follow me.

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,700
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,800
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,320
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,340
Ugh, I'm cold tonight.

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,080
If I didn't get a night shift on this day, I'd be dead.

44
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,340
Ugh, I have a cold...

45
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,320
What's this?

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm sure there's still plenty of gasoline in there.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,040
This stupid Stomach!

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,280
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,380
Ow!

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,720
I'm freezing.

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
I've got a cold, my hands are cold and I can't train.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,820
I've got a cold, my hands are cold and I can't train.

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,020
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,780
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,020
Ow!

56
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,800
This is bad!

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,240
Why am I getting so hungry?

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:03,880
"Demaga Dema Yobu Ryotsu Nabe"

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,240
Why do I have to be alone like this?

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,520
Why do I have to be alone like this?

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm just not sure what's wrong with you two!

62
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,240
What did you say?

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
You want me to pay you the night shift?

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,680
Yeah.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,500
My father was hosting a party, and I had to attend it on my own.

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,780
I can't afford to go.

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
If I don't go, it might affect the future of the Japanese economy.

68
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,460
Well, I've been in the middle of it.

69
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,580
I've been in your care.

70
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll buy it if I can't help it.

71
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,040
Thank you very much.

72
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,660
I'm coming to you, senpai.

73
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,260
In return,

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,100
I know.

75
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,300
I'll make this arrangement someday.

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,400
I'd rather have a puffer fish.

77
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,120
Fugu sashimi, fried fish, puffer fish, puffer fish broth.

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,640
Uh, senpai.

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Well, the time is...

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,340
That's right.

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,580
After all, sardines, too.

82
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,780
Well, then, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,900
I'll take it.

84
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,740
Ah, leave it to me.

85
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,920
Yes, yes.

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,860
Now that it's decided, the night is long.

87
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm bored anyway, so I'll spend a night to finish it.

88
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,420
Ryo-chan, first.

89
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,580
Hey, Reiko.

90
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,640
Are you going home?

91
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,900
There's still time.

92
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,120
No.

93
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,300
Today, I told you that I would go early because I had a drink party with Komachi-chan and the others.

94
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,420
Oh, really?

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,620
Yes.

96
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,580
Oh, my, Ryo-chan.

97
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,320
The other day, I brought you a cake to thank you for paying the bill.

98
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,080
Well, I see.

99
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,700
Ryo-chan, you forget it after walking a little bit.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,620
Don't treat me like a bird.

101
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,520
But promise is a promise.

102
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,120
Yes, yes.

103
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,640
I know.

104
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,800
Please come here soon.

105
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,380
I'll go without being told.

106
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,300
See you later, Ryo-chan.

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,100
What do you mean, "See you later"?

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,940
They're shaking because of the cold.

109
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,480
If you take them out of the warm room,

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,120
they'll be full of good alcohol and delicious food.

111
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
And the worst thing is the manager.

112
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,680
Ryotsu, is Ryotsu here?

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,280
Oh, no. It's the manager.

114
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,060
Yes, I'm coming right now.

115
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,920
Manager, what's wrong?

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,880
I asked Nakagawa, but he changed his night shift.

117
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,020
Yes, it's for his cute junior.

118
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,620
It's for the Japanese economy.

119
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
It's not for Fugu.

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,420
Fugu?

121
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,260
I think he asked Nakagawa for something again.

122
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,360
No, it's just my big feelings as a senior.

123
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,480
Well, it's okay.

124
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Anyway, Ryotsu, I have an urgent business trip.

125
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,160
I have to get on the Shinkansen at 9 o'clock.

126
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,840
I have to get ready as soon as I get home.

127
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,680
Sorry.

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,920
But I'm counting on you.

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,640
Okay.

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,660
Ryotsu, Kankichi, while the manager is away,

131
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,600
I'll do my best to protect this station.

132
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,500
Don't be so overreacted.

133
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,320
I'll do it properly.

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,700
See you.

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,960
Have a good day.

136
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,140
I can stretch my wings without hesitation.

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't expect to be a boxer with a red pencil in your ear during your work.

138
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,540
I'm counting on you.

139
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm not alone.

140
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,120
It's too pathetic to cry.

141
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,380
Damn it, it's Tearai.

142
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,920
Clap!

143
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,660
Here, a train to Kouenmai.

144
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,380
Ryo-san?

145
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,820
Why Tearai?

146
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,020
I have a cold and have a fever of 39 degrees.

147
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,060
39 degrees?

148
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,920
It's a mild fever.

149
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm not like Ryo-san.

150
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,660
When I say 39 degrees, my head is spinning, my nose is spinning, and my legs are shaking.

151
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm about to die.

152
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,660
What are you talking about?

153
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm sorry, but please let me rest.

154
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,460
Stop it, you idiot. The wind is coming.

155
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,140
Will the phone come?

156
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,560
Okay, okay, go to sleep.

157
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,440
Ryo-san is so kind.

158
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,300
Damn it, I can't do it.

159
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,080
Even if the wind blows, it's a gap.

160
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,620
Who will be the winner?

161
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,640
What the hell?

162
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,380
I ate all the cup noodles that were left on the floor.

163
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,680
Damn it, this is terrible.

164
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,720
Why am I the only one who sees this?

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm working for Nagagawa, Reiko, Terai, and the head.

166
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,740
What the hell is this?

167
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,860
Damn it, I can't do it.

168
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,480
I'll be in trouble at the post office.

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,020
If it's tomorrow, I'll be found with ice.

170
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,740
Excuse me.

171
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,440
Hello?

172
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,940
Oh, Senpai?

173
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,300
Nagagawa, something terrible happened.

174
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,740
What terrible happened?

175
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,340
Is there meat there?

176
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,640
Meat?

177
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,300
There is, but what is it?

178
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't think anyone has eaten it yet.

179
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,740
Yes.

180
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm glad I made it in time.

181
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Did you say you made it in time?

182
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,560
Is there a problem with the meat?

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,840
No, not now.

184
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,020
Listen, Nagagawa.

185
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,020
Bring the meat to the post office immediately.

186
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,620
To the post office?

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Senpai, what do you mean?

188
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,360
Shh, don't make a loud voice.

189
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,740
Yes.

190
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,040
The head just got a very bad message.

191
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,820
Yes.

192
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,920
Listen, it's raw.

193
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,540
Oh, right.

194
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,600
Don't forget the seasoning for the ponzu.

195
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,520
Seasoning?

196
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes, the seasoning.

197
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,600
Not only the meat, but I don't know what else is in the seasoning.

198
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm in a big hurry.

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,660
I understand.

200
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm in a big hurry.

201
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,180
Yeah, the pot is the best in the cold.

202
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,560
Who is this?

203
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a boyfriend of Reiko's.

204
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,500
No, there is no one like her.

205
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,820
Oh, hello?

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,300
Oh, it's Reiko.

207
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,080
It's tough.

208
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,440
Ryo-chan, what's wrong?

209
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,080
The manager is...

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,300
The manager...

211
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,900
What?

212
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,680
What happened to the manager?

213
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,160
The manager...

214
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
He was crying.

215
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,920
Be strong, Ryo-chan.

216
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
The chief's life is...

217
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,180
...in a state of emergency!

218
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,160
What did you say?

219
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
The doctor said that he's too nervous to use it,

220
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,180
and that he'll be dead in a few days.

221
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,640
No way!

222
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,780
It seems that the lack of vitamins and calcium is the cause.

223
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,920
If we can feed him vegetables, somehow...

224
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,260
Come back soon, Reiko!

225
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,060
Okay, I'll be there soon.

226
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,040
Thank you.

227
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,920
Don't forget the vegetables.

228
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,500
Chinese cabbage, shungiku, and green onion.

229
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,420
What?

230
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,080
And I heard that you can also use shirataki and other seafood.

231
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,920
Especially fugu.

232
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,080
Bring it to the office immediately.

233
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,980
Please, for the chief's sake, Reiko!

234
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,380
Yes, it's me, Terai.

235
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,040
Ryo-san, what's up?

236
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,540
You did it, Terai!

237
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,900
Congratulations!

238
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,700
Congratulations? I'm still cold.

239
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
Don't be surprised.

240
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,780
I'm the donabe in your house.

241
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,820
Donabe?

242
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,680
That's right.

243
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,380
You know, I used to make hot pot at your house.

244
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,720
Oh, I see.

245
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,820
The chief brought a person who said that he could buy that donabe for 1 million yen.

246
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,240
1 million yen?

247
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
1 million?

248
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,040
That's right.

249
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,300
Bring it to the office right now.

250
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,140
But I bought it at the supermarket for 2,980 yen.

251
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,660
Yeah.

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,060
That's not true!

253
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,300
If you see it, you'll understand the difference.

254
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,220
You're mistaken.

255
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,300
It's a work of the Human Declaration.

256
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,740
It's a special edition.

257
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,620
It's a special edition.

258
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,700
I bought it.

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,000
What?

260
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,820
But it's like this.

261
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
You have to come out now.

262
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,300
The other person is a foreigner.

263
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
A foreigner?

264
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,700
Wait a minute.

265
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,200
I'll call you right now.

266
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,500
It's over.

267
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,180
I'm busy.

268
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,080
If I don't hurry, the plane will leave.

269
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll do something about it.

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
I don't have time anymore.

271
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,740
Will you come or not?

272
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,040
1 million yen will run away.

273
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,120
I'm coming right now.

274
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,780
Please wait for that person.

275
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,580
I'm going to do it.

276
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,660
I forgot to turn it off.

277
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,380
Here you go.

278
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Balbo!

279
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,260
Oh, Ryotsu.

280
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,760
I'm in the middle of a survival game.

281
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,820
I'll cut you.

282
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,820
Help me, Balbo!

283
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,800
What's up, Ryotsu?

284
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,620
Bobby, I won.

285
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,620
Jody!

286
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,820
Balbo!

287
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,680
Do you hear me?

288
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm the Cassette Gas Conloader!

289
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Bring me the gas!

290
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,140
I need a gas stove!

291
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,880
Whoa! Stop!

292
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,320
The stove, now!

293
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,540
I don't know, but Ryosu is in danger.

294
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

295
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,620
Hello?

296
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
What, is that your husband?

297
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,120
What?

298
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,800
What do you think?

299
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,880
Now we can have a fun hot pot party!

300
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,500
Senpai!

301
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,320
I brought the meat!

302
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,260
Senpai?

303
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,840
Ryo-chan!

304
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,160
Ryo-san, I brought the pot!

305
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,440
Ryosu, are you okay?

306
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,500
Senpai,

307
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,280
I brought the ingredients for the tamago-zake.

308
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,840
But isn't it a little too much?

309
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,380
Huh?

310
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,860
Oh, you're here, everyone.

311
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,260
Good job, good job.

312
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,440
Senpai, what the hell are you doing?

313
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,580
Meat, vegetables, seafood,

314
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,360
it's like you're making a hot pot.

315
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,220
Ping-pong!

316
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,880
That's right!

317
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:23,900
Huh?

318
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,500
No, I was gathered for emergency training,

319
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,740
but I couldn't make it because it was cold,

320
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,220
so I thought I'd make a hot pot.

321
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,620
Emergency training?

322
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
That's right!

323
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,420
That's not a joke!

324
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,300
That's right, Ryo-san!

325
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,980
What about one million yen?

326
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't make a fuss.

327
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,180
Let's have fun with the hot pot.

328
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,180
What do you mean, "let's have fun"?

329
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,060
You're fooling people,

330
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,040
it's too much of a bad joke!

331
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,140
I'm 39 degrees!

332
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,200
No matter how much it is...

333
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,260
It's too bad.

334
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,000
Ryo-san.

335
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,680
Huh?

336
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,500
Huh?

337
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,320
I, I just...

339
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,280
Don't be fooled by such a play.

340
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,660
Oh, I see.

341
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,680
It's a bit saddening, isn't it?

342
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,060
To be told that way by a friend who has been with me for years.

343
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,980
I guess I'll have to say goodbye to this locker.

344
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Huh?

345
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,000
And to this desk.

346
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,200
Did something happen, senpai?

347
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,500
Did the chief hit you often in this west?

348
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,820
Ryo-chan.

349
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,240
Hey, what's wrong?

350
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,200
This night, filled with memories.

351
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Hey, Ryo-san.

352
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,800
Ryo-san.

353
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,460
Senpai?

354
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:34,820
Senpai?

355
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,380
N, no, it's nothing.

356
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,500
This is my own problem.

357
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,640
What happened?

358
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,980
Actually...

359
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,480
No, I want to talk about this while eating the hot pot.

360
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,480
Did you do something and get a death certificate again?

361
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,480
But, if it's that bad,

362
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,800
Senpai wouldn't be depressed.

363
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
Then, maybe...

364
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,780
Super-Sexual Food?

365
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,320
Super-Sexual Food?

366
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,720
What?

367
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,100
A death certificate?

368
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,760
Is that so, Ryo-chan?

369
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,500
Don't make me say that.

370
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,880
But...

371
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,440
Life is like a hot pot.

372
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,440
What does that mean?

373
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,680
I don't know.

374
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,160
Tell me the truth.

375
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,580
Is it a death certificate?

376
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,580
Senpai...

377
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,900
It's fine.

378
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,500
Anyway, let's start the hot pot.

379
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,600
It's the last supper.

380
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,480
The last supper?

381
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,560
That means, after all...

382
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,700
Death certificate?

383
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,100
That's right!

384
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,240
That's right!

385
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,900
It's this place, as Senpai said.

386
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,860
We can do it even in a hot pot.

387
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,780
That's right.

388
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,540
Since we finally have all the ingredients, we can also do it in a hot pot.

389
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
There is also a cassette gas stove.

390
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,140
Yes!

391
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,340
There is also a drink!

392
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,820
Thank you.

393
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
It's good for everyone's kindness.

394
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,620
Thank you.

395
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,680
At the same time,

396
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,140
I got a call from someone.

397
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,780
They said something about Nick and left.

398
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,910
Nick?

399
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,660
That wasn't just a coincidence.

400
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
It seems like there's a secret.

401
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,660
Secret?

402
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,800
No way! Nick is developing in our company!

403
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,920
Yes, it's me.

404
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,760
What?!

405
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,800
The microchip Nick is developing in Gokuhi is...

406
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
Okay, I'll look into it.

407
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,200
Wh-What's going on?! Nick's file is gone!

408
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,520
This is an international conspiracy!

409
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,540
Colonel Buckley.

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,480
Yes.

411
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,680
Colonel, the young lady just sent a message.

412
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,100
From Jody?

413
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes. She said she'd go deliver the gascon, so she didn't have to come pick it up.

414
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,200
What?! The gascon?! Jody said that?!

415
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,160
The code name gascon is the code name of the emergency emergency system!

416
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,240
I'm sorry.

417
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,180
Colonel Buckley has an important report.

418
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,480
A terrorist with a new weapon in Japan's Katsushika Kameari is going to the presidential election?!

419
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,660
What?! Report it to the president immediately!

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,180
Ha ha ha ha!

421
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,720
It seems like Reiko has left the Katsushika Kameari.

422
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm sure there was something at the park before the exit.

423
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,180
Ha ha ha!

424
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,040
It's probably aliens invading.

425
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,220
Ha ha ha!

426
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,760
Awesome!

427
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,740
Is something wrong with Sagakashi?

428
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,180
No, but it seems that the area around Kameari has been completely invaded by aliens.

429
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Really?

430
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,180
The plants and tofu work well here!

431
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:57,840
Yes.

432
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,940
What? From the US Department of Defense?

433
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,740
I've just heard from the Treasury that there is an international conspiracy.

434
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,220
It's a big problem, sir.

435
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,420
What's going on?

436
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,820
A strange incident occurred at the exit in front of the park.

437
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,300
I know! Call Ohara right away!

438
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,060
What? The exit in front of the park?

439
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,880
I'll be there soon. It's a big problem.

440
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,640
I'll be there soon. It's a big problem.

441
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,800
Hey, Ryo-chan. Can you talk to me?

442
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,340
Well, that's...

443
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,540
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

444
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,040
Leave this to the Department of Defense!

445
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,520
Goofy, you're awesome!

446
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,700
I'm not!

447
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,260
We'll save the evil first.

448
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,260
We'll put the meat in later so that it doesn't get too hard.

449
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,840
That face doesn't look like it.

450
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
That face doesn't look like it.

451
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,680
Well, it's a problem.

452
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,800
Ohara is in charge of this exit.

453
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,660
Is it true that aliens on a Donabe-type UFO were attacked?

454
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,180
Are you kidding me?!

455
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,940
An international pianist has taken a new type of murder phone and has occupied the exit!

456
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,380
A pianist has?

457
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,140
Why did a pianist go to the exit?

458
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,280
The attack is ready.

459
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,860
Where is the brutal monster of肉?

460
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,640
It's the pianist!

461
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,420
Are you an alien?

462
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,680
A carnivore!

463
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,120
I'm a pianist!

464
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm an alien!

465
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
I'm a pianist!

466
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,900
I'm an alien!

467
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,080
Pianist?

468
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,740
Alien!

469
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,460
Pianist!

470
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:37,900
Alien!

471
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,600
He's attacking me!

472
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,360
W-wait a minute!

473
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,060
My subordinate has become a hostage!

474
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,560
It seems that the amount the culprit is demanding is 2980 yen.

475
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,880
Captain, we have received a call from Colonel Bakuryu.

476
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,080
What?

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,800
We'll arrive in 5 minutes.

478
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,120
If you're okay with that, you can launch a missile at any time.

479
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,020
No!

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,560
No!

481
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,780
My subordinate, Ryotsu, is here!

482
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,680
I can't do this!

483
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,560
There are 7 people inside.

484
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,260
There's a heat source in the center.

485
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,580
Is that a new weapon?

486
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,940
I'll have to find a way.

487
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,000
What's that?

488
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,400
Leave this to us MIB.

489
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,220
What are you talking about?

490
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,740
Our job is to protect peace in Japan!

491
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,580
No!

492
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,960
We are protecting peace on Earth!

493
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,080
Life is a hot pot!

494
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
By the way, Ryo, what really happened?

495
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,980
Take it easy, Ryo.

496
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,200
The night is long.

497
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,460
That's right.

498
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,220
Okay!

499
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,080
You can eat vegetables!

500
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay!

501
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,560
Ah!

502
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,160
The bomb!

503
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,260
I stretched out my hand to the bomb!

504
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,340
Okay!

505
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,520
Get the SWAT unit ready!

506
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,520
Ah!

507
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,020
Don't do that!

508
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,700
I'll tell Ryotsu...

509
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,640
Yes!

510
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,260
I'll call!

511
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,580
I'll ask for the culprit's request on the phone!

512
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,320
Okay!

513
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,420
It's about time to eat meat!

514
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,300
Huh?

515
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:15,660
Huh?

516
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,680
Who is it?

517
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,680
Even though it's a good place...

518
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,620
Yes, yes.

519
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,080
What happened?

520
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,060
Ryotsu!

521
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,600
Are you okay?

522
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,240
W-Warship!

523
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,040
Ah!

524
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,300
I can't go!

525
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,740
Ryotsu!

526
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,500
Ryotsu!

527
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,540
It's dangerous on the plane.

528
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
If we get them on the plane,

529
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,600
we don't know what to do!

530
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,500
Yah.

531
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,740
The SWAT unit has arrived on site!

532
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,320
Okay, let's wait for the orders!

533
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,980
We'll arrive at our target in a minute.

534
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,040
Attention, get ready to attack!

535
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,480
Yes!

536
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Isn't it too noisy outside?

537
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,600
Uh?

538
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,460
Terai!

539
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,340
Shut up, Terai!

540
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,400
Yeah.

541
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,580
Ah!

542
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,900
So, Terai became an hostage too.

543
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,200
Maybe Nakagawa and Reiko...

544
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,100
Uh, SWAT mezkin!

545
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,660
Please let us retreat.

546
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,340
There is a danger of being shot by the subordinates by mistake with the culprit.

547
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm counting on you.

548
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:02,960
Hmm.

549
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,080
Alright, let's switch to the rush operation.

550
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,580
B2 unit, ready for attack!

551
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,520
C3 unit, ready for attack!

552
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,420
D4 unit, ready for attack!

553
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
Alright, let's go!

554
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,760
Alright, it's finally time for the meat!

555
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,040
Let's eat!

556
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,580
That voice...

557
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,320
It's a rush operation!

558
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

559
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,360
Then, I'll try the meat again.

560
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,920
What's happening?

561
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,820
What the hell is that?

562
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,620
That violent face!

563
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,740
That's the culprit!

564
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,760
Catch him!

565
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
What the hell?

566
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,600
Stop it!

567
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,300
Ouch!

568
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,380
Stop it!

569
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,440
Ouch!

570
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,100
Don't run away!

571
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,340
Target detected.

572
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,360
Captured!

573
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,060
Captured completed.

574
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,160
We took care of the alien.

575
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,760
We took care of the alien.

576
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,000
What's that?

577
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,740
Captain Buckley, the host has been rescued.

578
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
Please return to base.

579
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,200
Roger that.

580
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm so glad!

581
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm so glad everyone is safe.

582
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,680
Where's Ryo-tsu?

583
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:41,140
I'm so glad everyone is safe.

584
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm so glad he is safe.

585
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,940
Captain Buckley is in 2019!

586
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,240
To be continued.

587
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,260
Edit 5: The Watchers

588
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,940
So, what happened yesterday?

589
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,800
Hey, make me eat some pot!

590
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,340
A living alien.

591
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,740
Hey, wait.

592
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,760
What are you doing?

593
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,360
Quit it!

594
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,080
I'm not a human being!

595
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,780
Help me!

596
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,740
Mommy!

597
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,560
Little granny!

598
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,120
Let me sing!

599
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,020
RABBIT N broadcast

600
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,440
RABBIT N broadcast

601
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,760
RABBIT N broadcast

602
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,200
I don't want to be an idiot to fight with the looks

603
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,240
When I was walking on the road at the bend corner, the moon escaped

604
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,660
I ran away

605
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,560
Because now is not everything

606
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,280
Don't worry too much

607
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,820
Even if you lie and cheat a little

608
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,640
Sometimes you're saving someone

609
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,440
Baby do you know me

610
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,360
I'm heading for tomorrow

611
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,740
Nice breath

612
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,220
Don't be rotten

613
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,700
I'll do what I have to do

614
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,300
A cute breath

615
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,900
What's hard to understand

616
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,360
I want to show you

617
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,280
It's better than seeing it

618
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,540
Delivery Police

619
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,420
A convenience store near a far-off station

620
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,280
If there is a station in a nearby convenience store

621
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,180
The security effect of the city is also increased

622
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,540
This is Columbus's egg enemy

623
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,860
A great plan of the two birds with one stone

624
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,740
Next time

625
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,600
Here is the convenience store exit

626
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,600
Thank you

627
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,780
There is a wall over there

628
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,600
There must be a wall

629
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,300
Everyone come to our town

630
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,980
To the town of the city

631
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,920
Thank you
