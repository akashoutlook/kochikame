1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm so happy you're here.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,760
Wait up, Reika!

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,040
Goodbye, Shunta.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,340
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,920
Hoshi!

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,920
I've always liked you.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,820
Ever since you were born.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,400
You're so touching.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,560
Mr. Honda, you're a big fan of girl manga, right?

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,040
She's the girl manga artist, Nana-chan, the sound girl.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,400
Oh, by the way, you were in the same week as Sapphire, right?

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,700
Yeah, it's been three years since I started.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,100
Wow, that's a long time.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,380
Yeah, I remember.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,460
I have a manuscript for next week.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Here it is.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,280
What?

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,140
I always send it by fax, so I can keep the manuscript.

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,840
But you can't throw it away.

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,320
What? I don't have a manga of you.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,920
I thought you quit.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,240
What? I'm sending you a manuscript every week.

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,020
I'm sending you a manuscript every week.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,080
I've never gotten it.

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,600
Oh, here it is.

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,580
What? A reading space?

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,820
The same treatment as an amateur.

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,140
Damn it.

29
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,340
By the way, I used to be four pieces of a 12-page work.

30
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,960
Are you meeting the director properly?

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,580
No, not for the past few years.

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,860
The contents and pages are free.

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,340
There's no such serial.

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,460
How much is the manuscript?

35
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,900
Hmm, I don't remember getting it recently.

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,280
Ah, by the way,

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,160
I've sent a pendant from the editorial department.

38
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,880
Senpai, here's the thing.

39
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,800
A present for everyone?

40
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,080
It's like a simple reader who likes to post.

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,160
I don't think he's a serial writer.

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,320
Ryusenshi, if you meet him next time, you'll get paid for free.

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,300
Hello.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,520
Oh, Nana-chan.

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,060
Hello.

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,560
Hello.

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,980
Honda-san, did you wait?

48
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,840
Not at all.

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
I was listening to Senpai's interesting story.

50
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,460
Then we're going on a date.

51
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,440
What?

52
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm just wasting my time.

53
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,980
Well, everyone.

54
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,380
Excuse me.

55
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Good morning.

56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,220
Let's go!

57
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,240
Honda-san and Nana-chan are a perfect couple.

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm so jealous that they're so close.

59
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,240
Honda and Otohime are the best couples that everyone envies.

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,120
But if something terrible happens to these two,

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
Otohime will be the one to blame.

62
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,280
In the end, no one knew how to stop him.

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,260
When you watch TV,

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,780
light the room to make it brighter,

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,900
and try to look out the window.

66
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,760
The next day

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,940
It's the same morning.

68
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,300
The next day

69
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,960
It's the same morning.

70
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,960
The next day

71
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,100
The next day

72
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,940
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

73
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,140
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

74
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,680
You know, right? You know, you know!

75
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,120
If you know, then quietly follow me!

76
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,400
The Great Collapse of Love

77
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:38,760
The Great Collapse of Love

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
It looks like you've been caught red-handed!

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,340
He's still chasing after us!

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,860
No way!

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,880
Stop!

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,320
You monster!

83
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,040
I'm telling you to stop!

84
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,820
I'm telling you to stop!

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,500
Do you think you can get away from this Honda of the future?

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,560
What? Honda of the future?

87
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,140
That legendary racer, Mr. Honda?

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,260
Sorry!

89
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,180
Did you catch him?

90
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,600
Yeah, perfect.

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,780
That legendary racer, Mr. Honda?

92
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,560
Today's super video is a scoop of the moment when the evil gang was arrested.

93
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,660
Please watch the powerful video.

94
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,340
Today's super video is a scoop of the moment when the evil gang was arrested.

95
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,740
This police officer is the number one driver of a car off-road.

96
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
He's the Honda Hayato of the Katsushika Prefecture.

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh!

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:42,820
Oh!

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,380
Oh!

100
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,180
It's Honda!

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,580
It's Honda!

102
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,860
You saw it on TV.

103
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
It was very cool.

104
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,260
No, I was embarrassed.

105
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,240
He's the one and only guy of the time.

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
What?!

107
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,700
Hey, never mind.

108
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's do this.

109
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,880
I want you to take a picture with me.

110
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,880
Me first?

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
I'd like to.

112
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,240
I'd like to go first.

113
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,340
You two are popular.

114
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,360
Let's take a picture!

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,520
Let's do this.

116
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,180
Let's do this.

117
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,980
"Katsushika-San"

118
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,480
"Katsushika-San"

119
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,940
"Katsushika-San"

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:25,620
"Katsushika-San"

121
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,600
"Katsushika-San"

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,580
Senpai, look at this!

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,020
What is this?

124
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,000
Everyone's sending letters and fax to Honda-san.

125
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,740
It seems that there are already a lot of emails to the "Katsushika-San" office.

126
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,980
It seems that there are already a lot of emails to the "Katsushika-San" office.

127
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,740
The "Katsushika-San" office is also sending a sign to the "Katsushika-San" office.

128
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,520
You are a modern hero.

129
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm not a hero.

130
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
This is Honda-kun's bike.

131
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,620
Is Honda-kun here?

132
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,440
I want to catch him.

133
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,420
I want to ride behind Honda-kun.

134
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,660
I want to ride too.

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
Honda-kun!

136
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,120
It's Honda-kun.

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,000
What should we do, Senpai?

138
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,120
If we go out now, we'll be in a panic.

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,860
What? I'm fine.

140
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,980
Why?

141
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,660
That's right. The power of the current female high school students is amazing.

142
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,780
I'm fine.

143
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,520
So why?

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,240
Think about it. The world only knows the face when Honda rides a motorcycle.

145
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,020
Oh, that's right.

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,720
That's right.

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,360
G...

148
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,480
What?

149
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,240
You don't have the same image as me, do you?

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,780
Yes!

151
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,240
So you should go out of the way.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,440
Look.

153
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

155
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,360
It's Honda-kun!

156
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,800
The version of when he wasn't on a motorcycle.

157
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

158
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,960
Senpai, help me!

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
Damn it.

160
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,120
Did you break your usual face, too?

161
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,720
Help me, Senpai!

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,860
It's been a while since I've been working.

163
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,300
What?

164
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,120
I'm going to work, too.

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
Help me, please!

166
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,000
What's wrong, Honda?

167
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,260
Sen... Senpai...

168
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
It's dark.

169
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,380
Is something wrong?

170
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,260
Senpai!

171
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,100
Hey!

172
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,400
What's wrong?

173
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,380
Sen... Senpai, I can't do it anymore!

174
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,100
I don't know if you were crying.

175
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
Try to explain it properly.

176
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,380
Here, Honda-san, a handkerchief.

177
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,660
Thank you very much.

178
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,840
You're very kind, too.

179
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,380
It's not like this, is it?

180
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,420
You're saying thank you, but how do you explain it to me?

181
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Do you think I can do it,

182
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,840
even if I can't do it?

183
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:50,980
I'm sure I can, but...

184
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,920
I will be using some people's words.

185
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,000
It's not easy in such a way.

186
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,240
Sir.

187
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,740
Oh, Intimidation!

188
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,480
Never do that!

189
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,860
No matter which word you use,

190
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:00,960
Ryo-chan!

191
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,740
So that's how you fought with Otohime.

192
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,420
That's right. I don't like the details, what should I do, senpai?

193
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,320
That's it.

194
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,980
That's it, Ryo-chan?

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,740
That's right, senpai.

196
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,860
Honda suddenly became popular, so it's burning.

197
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,540
The boom will be gone in no time.

198
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,780
If you can endure it, you'll be like the old Sayan.

199
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,800
I can't endure it.

200
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,700
Nana-chan won't come to my cell phone, and she won't reply to my mail.

201
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm no good.

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,900
You're overreacting. You don't know even if you cry.

203
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,780
Now, go home.

204
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,400
Senpai, that's not true.

205
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,460
Shut up!

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,940
You can solve your own problems by yourself.

207
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,020
Yes.

208
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,700
Are you really okay?

209
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,760
Ryo-san.

210
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,080
At times like this, time will solve everything.

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,260
Just leave it.

212
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,880
I'm the master of love, so there's no doubt about it.

213
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,200
Eh? Ryo-san was the master of love?

214
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,300
I've never heard of it.

215
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,940
Anyway, he's the master of love.

216
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,660
That's right.

217
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,480
Shut up!

218
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,620
Ah!

219
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,540
Damn it, look!

220
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,880
Honda is in a hurry?

221
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,460
Yes, it's been like this since the day before yesterday.

222
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,060
It's serious.

223
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,500
Senpai, are you really okay?

224
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,400
Just leave it like this.

225
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,620
It's fine.

226
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,600
Such trials make love stronger than love.

227
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,500
What you're saying is the most important thing.

228
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,180
Hello?

229
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Ah, Ryusenshi!

230
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,480
Hey, you're treating my manga with dignity!

231
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,180
What? An emergency?

232
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,800
Otohime's manuscript hasn't been published yet?

233
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,580
I see.

234
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,920
I was in a hurry last time, so I was late.

235
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
It's dangerous this time, too.

236
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,580
Hmm. Are you influenced by Honda?

237
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,820
Yes.

238
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm consulting with them.

239
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,880
I want Ryotsu-san to get along with them well.

240
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,220
In other words, you want them to get along?

241
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,560
My manga is the sign of my life, so there are many more emergencies.

242
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,940
If you can help me, I can think about Ryotsu-san's serial.

243
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,760
It's not okay to think about it.

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,920
Please do.

245
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,220
Please.

246
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,300
Please.

247
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,620
Then write 50 pages of the Kanto-color and put it on.

248
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,180
That's a little...

249
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,520
Oh, I see.

250
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,120
I see.

251
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,300
I'll write 50 pages of the Kanto-color and put it on.

252
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,320
All right. I have an idea.

253
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,980
Well, leave it to me.

254
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,240
Yes.

255
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,440
Yes.

256
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,860
I'll write it.

257
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,460
I'll write it.

258
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,720
I'll write it.

259
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:49,960
I'll write it.

260
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Oh, it's a key.

261
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,060
There's one key and it's very interesting.

262
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you know what this check is?

263
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,800
Let me know.

264
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,720
I know.

265
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,940
Mom, why are you crying?

266
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,400
I mean, don't cry.

267
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Because it's time.

268
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,020
Well, you couldn't stop.

269
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,240
I have to cry, too.

270
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,300
It's time.

271
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,700
Mr. Hayato!

272
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,260
And the person who saw that was...

273
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,680
"I can't beat you for being so strong in love."

274
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
That's how it went.

275
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,940
It won't work out that well.

276
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,460
Yeah.

277
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,960
Leave it to me.

278
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,180
No matter what you say, I'm the master of love.

279
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
But what are you going to do with the other person?

280
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm the chief. The chief.

281
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,340
Get up, Honda!

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,760
Get up!

283
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,780
It's not time for you to sleep. Get up!

284
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,460
I don't want to!

285
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,660
It's okay. Get up.

286
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,020
Please leave me alone!

287
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,740
Women are not only princesses.

288
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,440
No! I don't want to be Nana-chan!

289
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,760
Believe in me, the master of love!

290
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,640
I can only believe in three things about you!

291
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,140
Forget about being a princess!

292
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,160
Live a strong life!

293
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,340
No!

294
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,380
The meeting that the chief recommends

295
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,220
is one of my past spirits.

296
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,020
If you don't believe me, I won't let you go.

297
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,720
It won't work out.

298
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,240
Honda, sorry to keep you waiting.

299
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,280
Hello, chief.

300
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,340
Come in.

301
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Yes.

302
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,840
What a beautiful lady!

303
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,120
I'm Noriko Asakusa.

304
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,800
"Noriko Asakusa"

305
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,180
"Noriko Asakusa"

306
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,560
"Noriko Asakusa"

307
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,340
"Noriko Asakusa"

308
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,380
"Noriko Asakusa"

309
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
"Noriko Asakusa"

310
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,120
"Noriko Asakusa"

311
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,340
"Noriko Asakusa"

312
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,540
"Noriko Asakusa"

313
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,140
"Noriko Asakusa"

314
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,900
"Noriko Asakusa"

315
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
"Noriko Asakusa"

316
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,640
"Noriko Asakusa"

317
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,900
"Noriko Asakusa"

318
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,680
"Noriko Asakusa"

319
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,920
"Noriko Asakusa"

320
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,660
"Noriko Asakusa"

321
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,240
See you later, Honda.

322
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,900
Senpai!

323
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,180
Your eyes are really cute.

324
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,860
What? My eyes?

325
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,540
I recall a lot of people who have that kind of look.

326
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,580
Everyone. You have this photo with you.

327
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,840
Really?

328
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,100
All of my photos were filmed on that TV,

329
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I've also put it on the TV and filmed it.

330
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,540
But it's more wonderful to see the real thing than to see it on TV or in pictures.

331
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,720
H-Hi...

332
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,900
H-H-Haha...

333
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
You're the type like me.

334
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,140
What do you think?

335
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,800
Huh?

336
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,720
Hey...

337
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
T-That's pretty.

338
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,420
Not that.

339
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,340
Do you like it or not?

340
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,800
Hey, which one?

341
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,960
W-Which one?

342
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm positive.

343
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,020
I love food.

344
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,760
Huh? I forgot something.

345
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,020
What is it?

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,020
I can't help it.

347
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,400
I'll go get it.

348
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,580
You can go home first.

349
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,980
See you.

350
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,060
It looks delicious.

351
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,560
Come on. Let's eat a lot and cheer up.

352
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay.

353
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,020
Hey, Dara.

354
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,260
Yes?

355
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,920
You're so cute.

356
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,360
If you can't help it...

357
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,380
I guess this is where Ryu and Princess Oto are.

358
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,680
Well.

359
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,180
Yes, we are here.

360
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,080
Vadivac is here...

361
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,740
With this Razi-con mouse.

362
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,580
Go.

363
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,620
A-An-A mouse!

364
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,480
That's not good for a mouse!

365
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,180
No! You're not my opponent!

366
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,780
Move!

367
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,400
Mr. Ryu...

368
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,660
Nana...

369
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,860
Nana!

370
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,460
What's so funny?

371
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,120
Nana!

372
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,420
Nana!

373
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,160
Oh, Nana...

374
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,380
How's it? It's perfect, right?

375
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,500
It's a little different from what I planned, though.

376
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,620
You made it, huh?

377
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,560
Mr. Ryu!

378
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,500
You promised me something different!

379
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,340
Oh, really?

380
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,560
That's terrible, Senpai!

381
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,700
You completely hated Nana!

382
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,200
I'd rather die than do this!

383
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,440
No, I was at the meeting the other day.

384
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,900
The leader liked Honda very much.

385
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,580
He said he wanted to go out with me as a marriage proposal.

386
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,720
Hmm...

387
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,260
I'll tell him tomorrow.

388
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,320
Hey, Ryotsu.

389
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,900
Can you find us a date?

390
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,800
Yes, yes.

391
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,780
Well then, I'm counting on you.

392
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,580
It's the first couple in my name.

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,680
What are you going to do, Ryo-chan?

394
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,560
That's right, Senpai.

395
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,220
But there's a little mistake.

396
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
I'll leave it to you.

397
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,320
If you do that, the two of you will be in trouble.

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,040
Hmm...

399
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,320
What's the point of being a master of love?

400
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
It's your responsibility.

401
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,260
I know.

402
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,220
But I have a good idea.

403
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,400
I can cry no matter how many times I watch this movie.

404
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,000
That's right, this is it!

405
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,500
In the extreme state,

406
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,260
match Honda and Otohime!

407
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,060
This is the only way!

408
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,700
Nana-chan, I don't care what happens.

409
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,700
You're going to live for me.

410
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,960
No, no.

411
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,560
I can't beat your love.

412
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,300
For my sake,

413
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,200
I want you two to be happy.

414
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
If you see your two loves tied together,

415
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,820
they'll give up.

416
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,320
Nakagawa!

417
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,400
Make my good attraction for the Nakagawa amusement park scene.

418
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,820
Let's do it with a special-purpose construction.

419
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,320
What?

420
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,240
*

421
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,000
Hurry up!

422
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,840
You have to finish it by tomorrow!

423
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,480
*

424
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,400
*

425
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,420
*

426
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm done.

427
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,520
Senpai, I don't like people other than Nana-chan.

428
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,080
I don't like people other than Nana-chan.

429
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,760
It's the chief's order.

430
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,280
This way.

431
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,460
Senpai!

432
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,320
Come with me!

433
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,240
Ah, yes!

434
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,980
This way!

435
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't feel like coming here.

436
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,440
It's okay, it's okay.

437
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,360
Just play with it and forget about the bad things.

438
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,640
That's right.

439
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,260
Ah, this is good.

440
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,520
But...

441
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,920
Wow, it looks fun!

442
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,140
Let's cheer up!

443
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,080
Yes.

444
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,860
Here.

445
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,500
It's here, isn't it?

446
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,440
You're Asakusa Norika, right?

447
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes.

448
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,160
Mr. Honda seems to be a little late.

449
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,460
Until now, he had promised to be my partner.

450
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,640
Eh?

451
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,260
There's a tea room over there, so let's wait there.

452
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,080
Yes.

453
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,880
Well, let's start from here.

454
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:45,860
Eh?

455
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,680
You're not going on a date with Norika?

456
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,500
Yes, sir.

457
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
Excuse me.

458
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,920
This is ...

459
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,560
Everyone is a robot.

460
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,620
R-Robot?

461
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,260
Oh wow!

462
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,740
Look, look, that outfit is cute.

463
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,680
Nakagawa, are you a Nakagawa concert?

464
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,220
E-Well ...

465
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm Nakagawa's magazine.

466
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,000
Everyone has them!

467
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,720
I-Is that so...

468
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,260
Senpai, that just now...

469
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,500
We've collided with the Hyozan! Everyone, please evacuate!

470
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,300
Hyozan?!

471
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,760
Alright, next it's just Honda and Otohime.

472
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,420
"Honda and Otohime"

473
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,160
Nana-chan!

474
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,460
Honda-san!

475
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,200
Hey, stop it!

476
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,940
What are you doing?

477
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,700
Stop talking!

478
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,740
Nana-chan...

479
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,040
Honda-san...

480
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,920
Nana-chan!

481
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
What is that the atomic bomb?

482
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,700
Are you serious?

483
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,920
They think the computer is not working.

484
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,800
Seriously...

485
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,060
Let me go.

486
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,720
It's not like that.

487
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,780
What the hell?

488
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,900
The ship is sinking.

489
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,120
Damn it...

490
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,520
Please...

491
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,860
Kogachi, catch me if you can!

492
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,540
This... this...

493
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,600
It's sinking!

494
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,440
You're not going to make a good thing if you're here!

495
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,680
Shut up!

496
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,580
Go over there!

497
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,640
You're not getting away!

498
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm not!

499
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm not!

500
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,640
Get out of my way!

501
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,640
Get out of my way!

502
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,700
Hey, by the way, this is just like the Titanic, right?

503
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,080
So after this, you're the only one who sinks in the water, right?

504
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,300
That's great!

505
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,840
You're so funny!

506
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,380
But, by the way, it's not funny at all.

507
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,020
What? What is this music?

508
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,100
Idiot! Why the shark?

509
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,620
The more we get in trouble, the stronger our hearts are bound.

510
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

511
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,480
If you're bound, you'd better be eaten by a shark!

512
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,860
I'm the same!

513
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,960
You're going to be eaten!

514
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,180
You first!

515
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,280
You first!

516
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,040
You're the same! Fight me!

517
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:14,940
Shut up!

518
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,360
You're going to get caught in that bowl!

519
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,300
What the hell is this? What's going on?

520
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,960
This love for a gay man is no joke!

521
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,600
I'm not kidding with this little horse!

522
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,880
Don't touch it!

523
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,020
My head isaking!

524
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,200
Look, Ryo!

525
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,180
Komachi!

526
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,920
Reiko, where are Honda and Otohime?

527
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,020
That way!

528
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,860
Good grief!

529
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,660
Love may be born out of the blue!

530
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,940
Just as you said, you're the Master of Love.

531
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,780
But...

532
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,060
Grrrr!

533
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,820
In the name of the Master!

534
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,040
In the name of the Master!

535
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,360
In the name of the Master!

536
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,480
Pl sortie!

537
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,620
Pl sortie! Pl sortie! In the name of the Master!

538
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,260
In the name of the Master!

539
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,000
There are couples who don't know each other.

540
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,120
Help me, Senpai!

541
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
Mr. Nakagawa!

542
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
What's wrong, Mr. Nakagawa?

543
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,720
He says I'm better than Mr. Honda!

544
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,240
Wait! Mr. Keiichi!

545
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,120
Nana-chan!

546
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,880
Mr. Honda!

547
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,500
No! No! No!

548
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,000
What's wrong, Senpai?

549
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,360
I promised to read 50 pages of the book with Ryu-senshi.

550
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,860
But it's not on the page.

551
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,060
Maybe it's this.

552
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,800
It looks like a fingerprint, but when I look closely, it's a page.

553
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,320
It's on the page, so I wrote it on the page.

554
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,860
Ryo-chan, you got one.

555
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,520
Damn it, Ryu-senshi!

556
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,240
If I get it again, I'll pay for it!

557
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
Ryo-chan!

558
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,400
Yes, I kind of had a fantastic question.

559
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,020
If you're foreign, where do you live?

560
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,200
Do you live in Nagasaki?

561
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,940
I'm sure you don't know.

562
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,480
I don't know either.

563
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,660
If you go down the wrong path, the moon will run away

564
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,460
Because now is not everything

565
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,920
Don't worry too much

566
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,660
Even if you lie and cheat a little

567
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,600
Sometimes you are helping someone

568
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Baby do you know me?

569
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,360
Head to tomorrow

570
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,640
Nice breath

571
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,180
Don't be sick

572
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,500
I'll do what I do

573
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,320
Cute breath

574
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,820
I want to show you

575
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,520
What is hard to understand

576
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,860
It's better than seeing it again

577
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:24,940
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

578
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,620
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

579
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:55,540
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

580
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,560
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

581
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town!

582
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,940
Thank you!
