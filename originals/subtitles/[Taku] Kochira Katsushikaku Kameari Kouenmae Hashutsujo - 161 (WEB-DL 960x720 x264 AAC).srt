2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,600
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,900
Make the room bright and try to get away

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:24,620
Like someone calling

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,200
After the rain

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,000
Walking with looking back

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,980
I reached out to the gacha

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,640
I felt

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,100
So

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,120
I tried to walk

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,440
On the outside of the arcade

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,380
In a black place

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,200
Everyone was a child once

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,660
But everyone forgets

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,340
A politician with a proud face

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt on his eyes

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,320
Turn around

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,020
That corner

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,500
You can meet everyone

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,480
There is a wall over there

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,760
There is a wall over there

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,800
There must be a turtle

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone come to our town

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you!

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,540
I fell asleep

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,200
Oh, Senpai!

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,140
Reiko's demon!

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,140
You should get rid of the pain quickly, right?

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Ah, I'm exhausted today.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,540
Why?

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,800
No, I just thought I was somehow weak.

56
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,920
If you're saying that you're not strong enough,

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
everyone will see your pain.

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,540
No, no, no, I don't want to.

59
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,520
No!

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,500
Ryo-chan's luck today is the worst.

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,640
Luck?

62
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,460
This is a weekly magazine with all kinds of fortune-telling.

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,980
I read Ryo-chan's fortune on March 3rd with the fortune-telling technique.

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,420
Today is the worst day of 100 years.

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,180
No luck in money, no luck in work, no luck in love.

66
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,640
It's a big possibility of getting involved in a big accident.

67
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,480
Don't say something that's not a good thing!

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,140
That's...

69
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
It hurts!

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,880
It's right.

71
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
It says, "Be careful of the rolling pencils."

72
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,680
What?

73
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,780
It's a pretty bad luck.

74
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,000
It's just a coincidence.

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,180
If today's luck is so bad,

76
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,400
how about we finish today as soon as possible?

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,100
What?

78
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,860
What do you mean?

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,900
If you go to Kiribasu, the island country that has the earliest 2000 years in the world,

80
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,900
you can go to tomorrow a step ahead of Japan.

81
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,680
Kiribasu is at the very top of the date change line,

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,000
so today will end as soon as possible.

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,260
It's a misfortune for the people, but it's fun!

84
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,320
Then, this time, let's go to the blood.

85
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,400
I don't know if I can go to the blood.

86
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,140
Don't do it!

87
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,300
Don't worry about it!

88
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,960
Ryo-chan, what's the blood type?

89
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,700
B.

90
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,480
B.

91
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:08,460
The B-type today is extremely out of tune with the biorhythm.

92
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,180
Go! Go! B-type!

93
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,340
You've broken your body and failed at work, so be careful!

94
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,020
Go!

95
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,180
Hey! Ouch!

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
You got it right.

97
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,840
It says "B type, be careful of the ball."

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,000
Today's Billy is B type.

99
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,860
He can't do anything.

100
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,280
He should stay at home.

101
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,120
Look, Ryo.

102
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,240
This is the worst kind of ghost.

103
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,340
It's exactly like Ryo.

104
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,300
Enough already!

105
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,260
I don't know who decided it,

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,380
but my life depends on it.

107
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,560
I'm going to die!

108
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,580
You should be careful.

109
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,260
Even fortune-telling is a bad luck.

110
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,860
It's the worst thing in life.

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,980
Watch out for the tank on Mondays.

112
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,700
Don't say that!

113
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,640
Why does it have to be a tank at night?

114
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,840
Don't say something unrealistic!

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
It's a real tank!

116
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
You got it right again.

117
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,020
You idiot!

118
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,540
You're going to die in one step!

119
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,260
Sorry, I got it wrong.

120
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,160
Give me that book!

121
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,420
You're not lucky enough to get it right.

122
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,740
I'm in a bad mood.

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Let me talk to you.

124
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,880
I got it right!

125
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,580
Watch out for the water on the water table.

126
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,580
That's why fortune-telling has always been

127
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,180
about getting it right or not.

128
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,660
There are things that don't get it right.

129
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,020
Fortune-telling is about getting it right.

130
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,520
You should break up with him right away.

131
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,860
Fortune-telling is about getting it right.

132
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
You should break up with him.

133
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,060
Wait, wait, wait.

134
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,540
Calm down, sir.

135
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,940
I'm not going to hit you.

136
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
No way!

137
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,160
I knew it.

138
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,340
Fortune-telling is about getting it right.

139
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,300
You're going to die in one step.

140
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,080
You're going to die in one step.

141
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,680
Who's in charge?

142
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,600
What?

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,620
He has a problem.

144
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,340
Fortune-telling is about getting it right.

145
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,920
Fortune-telling is about getting it right.

146
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,640
You're wrong!

147
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
It just won't get it right!

148
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,260
Why do I keep getting frowned down?

149
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,160
Let's figure something out.

150
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,760
Chief Editor!

151
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,500
Are you the Chief Editor?

152
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,460
I want to ask you something.

153
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,360
This way, please.

154
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,420
I'd trouble you if you gave me a second.

155
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,900
I am familiar with all sorts of fortune-telling.

156
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,580
Oh! This is...

157
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,880
What? What's wrong with my hand?

158
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,820
I've never seen such a thick life line, but there are many obstacles to break it.

159
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,780
The idea of fortune telling with your hairstyle.

160
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,140
The beauty of fortune telling with your eyebrows.

161
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,260
The idea of fortune telling with your teeth.

162
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,120
From any angle, you're the worst luck today.

163
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,720
It doesn't matter what kind of tragedy happens.

164
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,080
It doesn't matter if you get angry.

165
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,200
What? What should I do? What should I do?

166
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,900
The best thing to do is to cut it right away.

167
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,140
Anger calls misfortune.

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,540
You will never get angry no matter what happens.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,980
A smile is the best way to smile.

170
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,560
If you smile, your misfortune will stop.

171
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,860
It's a day of hard work today.

172
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,460
Good luck.

173
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,940
There was a person who was hit by my fortune-telling guide.

175
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,220
Let's make a quick deal today.

176
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
Make a deal.

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,900
What's wrong with him?

178
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,340
This is bad.

179
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,380
Don't open your eyes.

180
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,700
Don't open your eyes.

181
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,540
You're going to get hurt from the fall.

182
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,740
What's going on?

183
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,980
Let's do it.

184
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,880
You'll be fine if you buy me aúng-gyŏ.

185
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,760
It's��이.

186
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,620
Take that.

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,020
You don't have to show it.

188
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,660
Think carefully.

189
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
*Sounds of the train*

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,940
*Sounds of the train*

191
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,040
*Sounds of the train*

192
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,520
*Sounds of the train*

193
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,720
*Sounds of the train*

194
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,000
*Sounds of the train*

195
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,040
*Sounds of the train*

196
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,520
*Sounds of the train*

197
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,320
*Sounds of the train*

198
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,620
*Sounds of the train*

199
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,680
*Sounds of the train*

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
*Sounds of the train*

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,120
*Sounds of the train*

202
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,760
*Sounds of the train*

203
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,660
*Sounds of the train*

204
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,920
*Sounds of the train*

205
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,720
*Sounds of the train*

206
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,340
*Sounds of the train*

207
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,480
*Sounds of the train*

208
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,360
*Sounds of the train*

209
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,020
*Sounds of the train*

210
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,480
*Sounds of the train*

211
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,360
*Sounds of the train*

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,680
I can trust your advice.

213
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Number nine.

214
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,660
Here you go.

215
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,540
Your wishes will not come true.

216
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,460
Your illness will last.

217
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,680
Your people will not come.

218
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,900
One more time!

219
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,540
Yes!

220
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,900
Number four.

221
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,480
Here you go.

222
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,900
One more time!

223
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,760
Yes!

224
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,020
Number thirteen.

225
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,260
Here you go.

226
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,920
Here you go again.

227
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,420
Here you go again.

228
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,420
Here you go again.

229
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,760
Here you go again.

230
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,520
Here you go again.

231
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Here you go again.

232
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,780
Welcome home.

233
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,020
No one should enter the room.

234
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,820
Don't come near me.

235
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,780
This is a huge mess.

236
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,080
Sir, this is...

237
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,040
There was a small accident this morning.

238
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,980
Yes.

239
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Don't worry.

240
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,760
Those who are in shape will one day perish.

241
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,280
Did something good happen, sir?

242
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Do you know what I mean?

243
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,220
Yes.

244
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,140
Happiness is coming from all over the body.

245
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,100
And now that you've formed a marriage with your husband,

246
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,040
you must be able to marry your daughter now.

247
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,520
In fact,

248
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,840
you received $1,000 in righteousries,

249
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,300
plus the family trip to Okinawa

250
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,400
as a pay- targets for the shopping Stir,

251
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,140
and by the way,

252
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
Daisuke, your grandchild...

253
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,820
Oh, manage!

254
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,960
This is what spring in this world is like!

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,340
What's going on?

256
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,120
The other side is the opposite.

257
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,960
Oh, did I say something?

258
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,920
Oh, no.

259
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,300
But if this keeps going on, I'll get worried.

260
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm afraid something bad will happen to me at some point.

261
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,440
You're a chicken-back-gurou, Chief.

262
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,180
That's right.

263
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,220
When you're with me, you should be as happy as you can be.

264
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,580
That's true.

265
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,480
By the way, where's Ryotsu?

266
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,560
Oh...

267
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,540
Who's there?

268
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,580
Abudara mandara hagehogestaka

269
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,040
Pion boyon no tonbara ge

270
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Abudora buddara dobi daba

271
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,240
Jonjyororin no papa

272
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,420

273
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420

274
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,980
Nandara kandara dobi habu hamuramu

275
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,200

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,940

Ainu-hyo no honjara ge

280
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,320
Huh? Who's there?

281
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,860
Ryotsu, are you in there?

282
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,840
Chief!

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,160
I have a favor to ask you.

284
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
Open this door.

285
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,940
No, I won't!

286
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,400
What?

287
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,140
I'm going to work today.

288
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,920
I've decided not to leave this room for a day.

289
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,360
What about your work?

290
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,840
Open this door, Ryotsu!

291
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm not opening this door even if it's the chief's order!

292
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:05,940
Huh?

293
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,180
What is this?

294
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,860
It's a magic shield.

295
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,460
Magic shield?

296
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,440
The most difficult to avoid goods on this magic shield temple are all here.

297
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,120
Most difficult to avoid?

298
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,340
To the contrary to the chief,

299
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,400
Senpai has been having bad luck since this morning.

300
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm supposed to be in a good mood today, but I'm so satisfied with the work that I became depressed.

301
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,300
Hm, so that's what a divine wish is for when things go back to normal.

302
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
I see.

303
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,700
Don't laugh at people's misfortunes!

304
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Oh, I almost forgot about something important.

305
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,320
Ryotsu, go to the library with me, from now on.

306
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,720
Huh?

307
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,000
Actually, the chief's children will get married soon,

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,740
and I want you to be the party manager for their show.

309
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,840
From the director.

310
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,640
What if it's a big time?

311
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,500
Are you pregnant?

312
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,100
If we want to make the festival more exciting...

313
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,680
There's no one who will stand on the right side of Senpai.

314
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,000
What do you think, Ryo-tsu?

315
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,940
Sorry, but I don't feel like celebrating people's happiness right now.

316
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,100
Besides, I've decided not to leave this room for a day today.

317
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, don't say that.

318
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,520
The director is saying that he would like to.

319
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,520
It's your chance to reply to him.

320
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,900
I don't want to!

321
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,000
Director Ohara has been following you a lot lately, Ryo-chan.

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,780
If you stay with the good-luck director, I think Ryo-chan will have a chance to return to his old self.

323
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,000
What?

324
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,740
Well, I don't know if it's true or not, but...

325
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,160
Well, this is like a lonely happiness.

326
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,080
Are you okay, director?

327
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,100
Thanks to the stuffed stuffed animal, I was saved.

328
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,140
Well, you're really lucky.

329
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,040
"Savings"

330
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,740
500 yen coin.

331
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,060
Wow, it was in my reach, but I didn't realize it.

332
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,540
Excuse me!

333
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,840
Yes?

334
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,280
I would like to ask about the way.

335
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,160
It's right here.

336
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,500
I see.

337
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,280
It seems you're lost on the way.

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Yes.

339
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,740
Do you understand?

340
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,660
Excuse me.

341
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,600
Oh, no, it's my job.

342
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,840
Oh, it's right here.

343
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,160
Oh, come on.

344
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,820
Oh!

345
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,340
It's true.

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,380
The chief is right.

347
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,780
Even with this fortune-telling guide, the chief's fortune is the best.

348
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,020
Today is the best day of the century.

349
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,680
The luck of gold is the best, the luck of work is the best, the luck of love is the best.

350
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,840
It will be blessed with a wonderful day.

351
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,540
Even the fortune-telling guide says the chief is the best.

352
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,200
Thank you very much.

353
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,040
I'll be in your care, chief.

354
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,460
I'll be in your care, chief.

355
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,780
Good and bad are two sides of the same coin.

356
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,100
There are people who don't realize that good fortune is coming,

357
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,460
and there are a lot of people who are bright and strong even in misfortune.

358
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm relieved to be by the chief.

359
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,940
My shoelaces...

360
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Hey, chief!

361
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,860
What?

362
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm sorry. I slipped.

363
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,580
Did you say you slipped?

364
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,360
As soon as I left the chief, this is what happened.

365
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,060
I will never leave the chief again.

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
What's that?

367
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,460
These two were walking like this before.

368
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,280
Don't look.

369
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,220
No, it's a warning from Abe-kun.

370
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,940
I'm embarrassed.

371
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,660
I'm coming out.

372
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,380
Ryo-chan, I think it's weird, so can you leave me?

373
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,260
No, I will never leave you.

374
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,940
You said you'd leave me.

375
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,500
You said you'd leave me.

376
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,200
No.

377
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,740
You said you'd leave me.

378
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,500
I don't want to.

379
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,800
I said you should leave me.

380
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:54,920
No.

381
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,620
You should leave me.

382
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,380
You're so mean.

383
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,000
You're so mean.

384
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,660
I know.

385
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,300
No.

386
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,660
No.

387
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,420
Hehehehe.

388
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,860
Aaaaaaaah!

389
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,840
Hehehehe.

390
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,620
Are you alright, Ryochi?

391
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
Hehehehehehe.

392
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,200
Goto!

393
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,320
Your Majesty.

394
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,100
Do not leave me behind!

395
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,420
Your Majesty!

396
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,140
I'm waiting, Your Majesty!

397
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,160
I'll get you!

398
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,080
-I'm trapped! -Mine!

399
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,660
-I'm trapped! -Mine!

400
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,320
Get crushed!

401
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,860
What the?

402
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,240
"Kichikata"

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,480
"Kichikata"

404
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,600
"Kichikata"

405
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,200
You're a burden, you bastard!

406
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,940
"Kichikata"

407
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,500
Captain! Please don't leave me!

408
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,400
"Kichikata"

409
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,560
Hey, hey, hey!

410
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,020
Don't grab my weird place!

411
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,480
"Kichikata"

412
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,520
"Kichikata"

413
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,140
"Kichikata"

414
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,420
"Kichikata"

415
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,100
Captain!

416
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,780
"Kichikata"

417
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,740
Ah!

418
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,200
Excuse me.

419
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,920
Huh?

420
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,620
Ah!

421
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,680
Ah!

422
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,780
Ah!

423
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,860
Ah!

424
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,360
Ah!

425
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,460
Ah!

426
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,100
You're going to get away with my luck.

427
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,140
Can you do something about it?

428
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,080
No!

429
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,800
Today is the worst day of my life.

430
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,380
Huh?

431
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,920
If you go to Kiribati, you'll be able to see tomorrow one step ahead of Japan.

432
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,920
That's right! Kiribati!

433
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,720
Ah!

434
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,780
Ah!

435
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:25,680
Ah!

436
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,600
Kiribati! Go to Kiribati!

437
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,200
Kiribati!

438
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,200
What is Kiribati?

439
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,900
It's here! Here!

440
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,260
Huh?

441
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,540
Yes, it's over there!

442
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,480
Good! Go in!

443
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,840
Kiribati!

444
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,820
Huh?!

445
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,180
What's that supposed to be?

446
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,960
Hitch-hiking?

447
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,540
Run!

448
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,360
Wait!

449
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
Ah!

450
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,920
Ah!

451
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,040
Uto-kun Red brawler

452
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,760
Here I come, boss!

453
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,660
Why the look on my face?

454
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,000
One, two, three!

455
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,140
Ugh!

456
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,000
A new jet?

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,080
!!

458
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,340
Hmm?

459
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,260
It's time, Jet...

460
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
Next time let that guy go!

461
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
Break the smoke Doyou!!

462
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,620
Whoa!

463
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,260
Tsu!!

464
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,920
Alright, let's do this!

465
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,840
And here we go!

466
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,520
Kiribatsu!!

467
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,400
Kiryu looks having a bad day.

468
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,780
Hey, hey!

469
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,640
The sky is really cold.

470
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,060
It's not good to be cold and fast.

471
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,240
It's a jumbo.

472
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,020
Here I go, chief!

473
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,120
Ready, set, go!

474
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,860
Kiribasu!

475
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,820
Kiribasu!

476
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,460
Yay! We're finally here!

477
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,360
This is Kiribasu.

478
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,520
Aloha!

479
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,180
Welcome to Hawaii!

480
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,000
Hawaii?

481
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,580
What does that mean?

482
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,920
It seems we have exceeded the time limit.

483
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,780
Hawaii's still a Monday.

484
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,940
The fish from yesterday...

485
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,180
No way!

486
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,600
Your worst day has begun again!

487
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,920
Unhaaah!

488
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,000
