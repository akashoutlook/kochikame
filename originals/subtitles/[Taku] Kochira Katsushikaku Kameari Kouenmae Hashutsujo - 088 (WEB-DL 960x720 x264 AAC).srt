1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,800
Elise

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,100
After watching a moonlit day floating in the river

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,780
Throwing an stone of love, I flip my shoes

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,700
I wonder if I should go to the kitchen where I saved up

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,160
I was laughed at as a child

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,540
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,960
There are Katsushika and Kameari

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,420
You don't change even from yawn

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,920
The cityscape is good

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:04,120
From Chusuito to Kaishakuten

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,640
Sunset hits the sky

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,660
I'm getting up and going back home tomorrow

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,940
I'm getting up and going back home tomorrow

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,420
Hey, Kazushika Shibamata, you lost your happiness again

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,180
But now you realize, you're an idiot

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
"Gekichin Ninja-G-san"

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,080
I-I'm getting excited...

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,700
You have Jody, so you don't need this man.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,340
I-I don't think there's a better woman than Jody.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,320
I don't think there's a better woman than Jody, but...

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
there's always a chance.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,600
That's right, open it.

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,380
Okay, then...

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,440
I-I thought my eyes were going to get hurt.

25
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,500
Help me! I don't want to see her!

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,680
You can just say you have a fiancée and say no.

27
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,780
I said that when I was talking about seeing her.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,760
Then she said, "bring her here!"

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah. I said, "bring her here!"

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,020
Yeah. I said, "bring her here!"

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,120
Then you can take Jody with you.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,880
But she's in the Navy now, and I can't get in touch with her.

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,840
First of all, if I don't win against her, I can't get married.

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,300
Please, do something.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,320
If this goes on, I'll get married to this guy.

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,440
There's nothing you can't do, but it's not easy.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,420
I'll pay you as much as you want!

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,820
Leave it to me!

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,220
You called me a crazy guy to get married to self-deceived prick.

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,200
N-Ninja!?

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Your grandfather is a ninja?

42
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,480
It's been like this for generations.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,420
My grandfather in reality wants me to get married.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,500
He'll be my successor.

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,180
He doesn't think he'll get married...

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,920
This is the same thing that happened to me!

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,100
Um, well, in that case...

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,120
You're gonna make a good fiancee, Maria.

49
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,660
I'll do my best!

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,380
Thank you.

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,920
That's my home.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,040
Yeah, you're right about that.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,440
It's a nice house.

54
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,020
It looks like a real ninja is going to come out.

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,980
There's no one in the house.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
Huh? You can't see him even though he's not in there?

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,980
If he's tied up in a red ribbon, he's a loser.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
In a place like that?

59
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,700
He should have told us where he was going with a stone.

60
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,520
With a stone?

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,160
There's a stone sign on Boy Scout.

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,360
Like this.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh, it looks like a ninja.

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,440
There it is!

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,940
It looks like he went shopping.

66
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,680
That's not how it works!

67
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,740
It's easy to understand.

68
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,880
It can't be helped if he's a loser.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,180
Let's wait inside.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,960
Here.

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,720
Grandpa is very diligent, so he's making traps here and there to avoid the fire.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,560
If he gets caught in one of those traps, he'll die!

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
If you're going to say that, tell Grandpa!

75
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,860
There!

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,060
I know!

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,040
It's a success!

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,320
Grandpa!

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,400
What? Is this a trap?

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,760
But why is he so frivolous?

81
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,720
He's going shopping in a very old-fashioned way.

82
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,660
He's wearing a very unsightly outfit, so that the ninja can't find out.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,840
That outfit is even more conspicuous!

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,180
But I often see it in historical dramas.

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,440
Huh?

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Huh?

87
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,880
Hmm...

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,960
This girl is...

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,540
You're the one who's going to marry her?

90
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,640
Yes.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,860
I'm Ai Asato.

92
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,140
You're so big!

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,580
I'm jealous of this beauty.

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,480
You mustn't let your guard down.

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,420
Yes.

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,600
You mustn't let your guard down.

97
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,760
We'll try it, too!

98
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,300
Shut up!

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Why are you so noisy?

100
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm Ryotsu, and I'm here to help you with your work.

101
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,280
And this is Nakagawa.

102
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,620
Nice to meet you.

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm not interested in men.

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,240
Ah...

105
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,200
Come on in.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,300
What are you doing?

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,320
I see.

108
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,460
What a great trick!

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,560
Follow me.

110
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,640
Huh?

111
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,980
Hey, you should be walking on the ground.

112
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,840
Why are you walking on the baltang?

113
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,880
Grandpa...

114
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,780
I was magic-watching you.

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,140
I was waiting for you.

116
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,120
Don't worry about that.

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Get in the back of the car, and I'll show you the through-ắtner.

118
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,500
You think I'm ill-mannered, too?

119
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,940
It hurts.

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,240
What's wrong?

121
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,900
What's wrong?

122
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,960
Uh...

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,320
Hey, what is wrong?

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,700
You think you're like my grandpa?

125
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:58,920
Oh, you don't know, right?

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,360
I have behavior problems.

127
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,700
My school is a well-nurtured school.

128
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,900
What's wrong?

129
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,700
What happened?

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,560
What happened?

131
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,740
So, Wansa, you collect the students and make a lot of money.

132
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,540
I'm going to change a little, so wait.

133
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,180
There's even a souvenir corner.

134
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,220
Hey, give me your signature.

135
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,540
There's a little bit in the main video.

136
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,800
Huh? It's your 188.

137
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Huh? What's this?

138
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,460
It's a tape. It's cheating.

139
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:30,540
It's cheating.

140
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,480
You're touching it without permission.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,660
Grandpa.

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,140
You're a dangerous guy.

143
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,080
You're a grandpa of a Volvo.

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
But you look like a ninja and you're cool.

145
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,880
It's really nice.

146
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,740
Is that so? Well, it's just tea.

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,480
It's herbal tea for your body.

148
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,300
Oh, my God.

149
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,020
But one of them contains a medicinal herb that can cure diarrhea.

150
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,820
What?

151
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,540
It's a training to make excuses.

152
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,700
I've been doing it since I was a child.

153
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,200
It's like Russian roulette.

154
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm going to drink this.

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
Ryo?

156
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,280
Yes.

157
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,420
This is wrong.

158
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,860
Grandpa.

159
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,460
That's what you said, right?

160
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:13,860
Yes.

161
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
It's a big hit.

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,460
What?

163
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,340
Why are you doing this to me?

164
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,120
I drank it.

165
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,180
Don't worry.

166
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,660
It's called Shinobi medicine.

167
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,440
Ninjas are familiar with various herbs.

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,480
It's a mixture of various herbs such as wound medicine and blood.

169
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Aall in this world, there are various herbs such as eczema,

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,320
and those he can't do without it.

171
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,360
So, you're really enjoying this.

172
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,100
But it's a matter of course, right?

173
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,500
But if you can do this to me,

174
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:38,820
you can't do it to me.

175
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,480
That's right.

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,040
I learned how to make it one by one and it helped me.

177
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,360
Yes!

178
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,480
The details are here.

179
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,160
Oh, I've seen it all over and over again.

180
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,580
What's this?

181
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,480
- It's 1,500 yen. - That's too high!

182
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,960
Then you can enjoy the

183
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,540
- I got it. I'll pay you. - Here you go.

184
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,820
- Here you go. - Here you go.

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,960
- Here you go. - Here you go.

186
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,720
- Here you go. - Here you go.

187
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,380
- Here you go. - Here you go.

188
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,440
- Here you go. - Here you go.

189
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,420
Boss, it's dangerous to throw the shuriken in the room.

190
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,920
- All right, get out of here. - I'll do it.

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,380
- I'll do it. - Master Ryo!

192
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,380
- Master Ryo! - Master Ryo!

193
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,060
Let's go.

194
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,780
- Let's go! - Let's go!

195
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,840
- Let's go! - Let's go!

196
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,920
- I'm going to win! - I'm going to win!

197
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
- I can't believe it. - Can't believe it.

198
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,140
How about this?

199
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,660
This is the ultimate ninja technique.

200
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,420
The technique of crushing the ground.

201
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,180
- It hurts. - Give me back the shuriken!

202
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,220
It's a unique technique.

203
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,180
Grandpa!

204
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,800
Balbo, stop being a cop and come back with that girl.

205
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,340
Huh? Why?

206
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,420
You'll be the successor of my ninja school.

207
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,900
No, I...

208
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,020
Why are you hesitating?

209
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
If you become my successor,

210
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,580
you'll be the successor of this land of 6,000 barrels and ninja school.

211
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,300
Huh? 6,000 barrels?

212
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,120
Hey, you! Who are you to do this?

213
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,020
Master!

214
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:48,920
Huh?

215
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,160
Please make me your disciple.

216
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,980
What? You?

217
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,560
I have learned a lot of your techniques.

218
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,100
I want to become a ninja as well!

219
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,680
I see. That's interesting.

220
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,700
Your technique is pretty good.

221
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,140
I'll take it!

222
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,480
Master...

223
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,700
What are you thinking?

224
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,520
Fine, I'll take it.

225
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,920
Thank you very much.

226
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,380
Huh?

227
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,080
Master, if you're going to open a ninja school,

228
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,040
why don't you make a female ninja, Funo Ishika?

229
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,100
Huh?

230
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,860
That's a good idea.

231
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,460
You like it, don't you?

232
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,700
Not as good as you.

233
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,140
Huh?

234
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,700
Hahaha!

235
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,900
I knew you'd say something like that.

236
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,640
Hahaha.

237
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,060
Master, I have a good idea.

238
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,760
I'll take your ear.

239
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,120
Huh?

240
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:42,760
What?

241
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm uses irrigation tool.

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,100
Heel...

243
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,240
Heel...

244
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,700
Nose...

245
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,400
Nose...

246
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,140
*Nose*

247
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,820
*Nose*

248
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,740
*Nose*

249
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,520
You worked hard, Kunoichi!

250
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,200
Hahaha.

251
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,880
This is the real Kunoichi.

252
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,520
He's a Bunny Girl, right?

253
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,840
Don't say that!

254
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,340
Big ears to protect enemies!

255
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,300
Hanging shoulderasse on himself.

256
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,820
undergoing the Block,

257
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm Kunoichi, right?

258
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,020
That's the one!

259
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,840
You're totally wrong!

260
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,260
I can't help it. I'm wearing this costume because it's popular.

261
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720
I like the one before.

262
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,280
I still feel like it's too colorful.

263
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,220
Why are you taking pictures?

264
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm going to use it as a pamphlet for the ninja school.

265
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,640
You know, the pamphlets and covers of travel companies are usually pretty, right?

266
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,940
It's a beauty that attracts young people.

267
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,800
I see.

268
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Maria, raise your hem so that you can see your thighs.

269
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,760
Like this?

270
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,080
Yeah, nice.

271
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,580
Okay, the next pose.

272
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,980
Leave it to me.

273
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
It's colorful when you put your shoulders out.

274
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,000
As expected of the master.

275
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,220
Let's go, Maria.

276
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,360
Okay.

277
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,820
In addition, close your arms in front of you and close your chest.

278
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,520
Why is your chest so small?

279
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,960
It's bad.

280
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,780
I see.

281
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,520
I pretended to be a fiancé of a Volvo.

282
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,920
I can't help it.

283
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll tell you the truth.

284
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,060
I'll take care of it.

285
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,820
Maria is a man.

286
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,940
What?

287
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you really a man?

288
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,500
Yes.

289
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey, did you fool me?

290
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,160
No, there's a deep reason for this.

291
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,260
Yes.

292
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,640
Jody.

293
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,620
Excuse me.

294
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,180
What's Jody?

295
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,920
This is it.

296
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,880
What?

297
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,260
Did you have a real girlfriend?

298
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,000
And she's a nice American.

299
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,520
What?

300
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:39,640
What?

301
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,220
It's not a penalty.

302
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,960
That's right, Master.

303
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,900
You could model Jody and take the cover of the pamphlet.

304
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,260
That's good, right?

305
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,720
I see.

306
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,800
It's good.

307
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,580
It's good.

308
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,160
And you can make Maria join you.

309
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,660
I can't stand it.

310
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,140
Well, then.

311
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,340
Jody's aircraft carrier has arrived at Yokosuka Port.

312
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,300
I'll go with you.

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,590
Okay.

314
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,220
I'll go too.

315
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,980
What?

316
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,100
Why are you going with Grandpa?

317
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,220
Your grandchild is the same as yours.

318
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll make you the model of the pamphlet of Ninja School.

319
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,040
What?

320
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:22,900
Okay.

321
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,020
Let's go to Yokosuka together.

322
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,380
No way.

323
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,440
Just do it.

324
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,720
What's that?

325
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,720
The helicopter is coming.

326
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,820
The landing schedule isn't working.

327
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,980
Episode 1

328
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,440
What's the matter?

329
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,080
I was passing by, so I came to see you.

330
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,040
Long time no see.

331
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,600
Gun!

332
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,020
No!

333
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,620
Well done, Jody.

334
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,760
Don't shoot me instead of greeting me.

335
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,180
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,580
Captain Bakuryu, welcome to my ship.

337
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm always indebted to you.

338
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,100
I've always heard the rumors about you.

339
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,060
I heard that you have played a role in many wars and warships.

340
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,200
No, it's nothing.

341
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,180
Well, I was about to say...

342
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,260
Captain Bakuryu

343
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,720
It's a great ship!

344
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,080
I found it.

345
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,840
You did it on purpose.

346
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,500
This is what I got from Mr. Ruby.

347
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,780
This is the time of the room battle.

348
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,020
This is the time of the first Ultra Operation.

349
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,060
Wow, another unauthorized helicopter is coming.

350
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,200
What?

351
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,300
What is this?

352
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,520
Mr. Jody.

353
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,780
Bomi.

354
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,420
Oh my darling.

355
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,400
Darling!

356
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,720
Long time no see.

357
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,640
What?

358
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,820
You're here!

359
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,700
Are you okay?

360
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,940
Yeah.

361
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,500
Hi, Jody.

362
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,160
It's a long time, Mr. Ryotsu.

363
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,460
What's wrong?

364
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,820
I'm a ninja's apprentice.

365
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,360
Master!

366
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,160
Let me introduce you.

367
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,320
This is my master, the grandpa of my grandpa, Ko-ganemaru Saigo.

368
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,400
Oh, Grandpa! Nice to meet you, I'm Jody!

369
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,900
Ah, me too.

370
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,100
Is this beautiful lady the bride?

371
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,560
Yes, well...

372
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
Grandpa, are you a ninja?

373
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,380
Oh, yes.

374
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
My apprentice, hold this.

375
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,620
Now, everyone, get out of the way!

376
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,560
What the...

377
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
Thank you.

378
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,860
I'm tired.

379
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,020
Oh, wonderful!

380
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,320
Fantastic!

381
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Master!

382
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,420
Alright.

383
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,460
Hey guys, a shuriken for ten dollars, please.

384
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,720
Thanks.

385
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,620
I didn't think you'd come all the way here to do business.

386
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,800
Show me more ninja skills!

387
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,140
OK.

388
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,720
Nice shot!

389
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,480
Nice!

390
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,920
Grandpa!

391
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,220
Grandpa!

392
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,020
Grandpa!

393
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,700
Grandpa!

394
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,100
Grandpa!

395
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,840
Grandpa!

396
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,620
Grandpa!

397
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,520
Grandpa!

398
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,100
Grandpa!

399
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,200
Grandpa!

400
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,400
Grandpa!

401
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,860
Grandpa!

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,240
Grandpa!

403
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,700
Grandpa!

404
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,300
Grandpa!

405
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,400
Grandpa!

406
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,880
Grandpa!

407
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,000
Grandpa!

408
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,020
Grandpa!

409
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,260
Grandpa!

410
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,280
Grandpa!

411
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,440
Grandpa!

412
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,860
A water cloud that can walk on water costs 30 dollars.

413
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,320
This Shinobi縄 is 25 dollars.

414
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,280
Give me a water cloud!

415
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,720
I want a Shinobi縄.

416
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes, yes, don't push.

417
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,720
It's a long time ago.

418
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,260
This... this is completely ignored.

419
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,100
Yes, yes, welcome.

420
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,440
It's very popular.

421
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,800
In America, ninjas are popular.

422
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,560
All right, all right.

423
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,920
Yes, cheese.

424
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,220
Yeah!

425
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,260
Don't get carried away.

426
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,840
Ninja are children's tricks after all.

427
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,860
What?

428
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,500
Are you trying to insult Japanese tradition?

429
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,240
Papa, it's rude to your darling grandpa.

430
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,340
Is it rude?

431
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,300
In front of the latest weapon of the ninja army, it's the same as a baby.

432
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,700
Shut up, bald gorilla.

433
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,540
What's this?

434
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
Hey, I won't forgive you if you make fun of the master.

435
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,440
Grandpa, stop it.

436
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,240
This person is my superior.

437
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
He's Jody's father.

438
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,320
Shut up.

439
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,780
I won't let you make fun of the ninja.

440
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,040
I'll let you taste the ninja's goodness.

441
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,380
Yeah.

442
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,000
Hey, don't make me stand up.

443
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,400
Oh.

444
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,460
Don't run away.

445
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,440
It's a fire.

446
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,620
No way.

447
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,140
It's a fire.

448
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,260
It's a fire.

449
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,620
It's a fire.

450
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

451
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,520
I'll show you what a naked soldier is capable of.

452
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,520
Damn it.

453
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,640
I'll make you get mad seriously.

454
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,100
You'll see what I can do.

455
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,040
Hey, where did he disappear?

456
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,620
There it is.

457
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,380
Yeah!

458
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,160
Got it?

459
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,860
S- Mr. Ryo!

460
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:19,940
Sir!

461
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,760
Senior!

462
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,780
In your face!

463
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,320
Get him!

464
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,720
Watch your mouth!

465
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,160
Master!

466
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
No, I can't even use my Dragon Ball!

467
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,060
You bastard! You won't get away with this!

468
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,600
Now, let's get to work!

469
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,260
Even if you say that, I can't use my ninja skills yet!

470
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,000
You'll become my successor and take over the land of the Sixth Sense!

471
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,020
Yes sir!

472
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,760
Understood!

473
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,920
Take this!

474
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,360
Stop!

475
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,300
Ouch!

476
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,980
How's that?

477
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,880
You bastard! You won't get away with this!

478
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,820
Damn it!

479
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,160
-Let's go get some water! -Yes sir!

480
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,260
You're so hard-working!

481
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm gonna kill you!

482
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,180
Take this!

483
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,740
You bastard! Stop the missiles!

484
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,980
How are you gonna do that?

485
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,000
Here you go, Mr. Horse!

486
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,140
Change the direction of the missiles!

487
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,220
What?

488
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,200
This way?

489
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,660
Or this way?

490
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,860
Alright!

491
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,420
Hey! Don't come back!

492
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,620
What did you say?

493
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,920
I'm gonna destroy the Eight-Sense-Tsubo in America!

494
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,140
Don't come back!

495
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,720
What? Eight-Sense-Tsubo?

496
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,360
Alright!

497
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,940
What?

498
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,280
You're betraying me?

499
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,540
That's the Eight-Sense-Tsubo!

500
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,760
I'm gonna destroy the Five-Sense-Tsubo in Urayama!

501
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,780
Alright!

502
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm gonna build Hawaii's best-seller!

503
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,100
Alright!

504
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,600
How about my new apartment?

505
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,420
Alright!

506
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,840
Let's build it!

507
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,160
Come on!

508
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,540
Come on!

509
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,880
Florida Orange Battle!

510
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,360
As an apology to the president, I,

511
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
Oh, no!

512
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,300
Huh?

513
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,540
He's coming this way!

514
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,780
It's an island!

515
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,480
Three of them!

516
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,380
That's right!

517
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,060
For you!

518
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,040
-Oh my god! -He's very sharp!

519
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,600
-What... -What?

520
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,340
He's sunk!

521
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,840
What should we do now, old man?

522
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,160
It's not my fault.

523
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,160
-He's the one who shot the missiles. -Dad!

524
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,140
Oh, no. It's practice time.

525
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,820
Old man, I'll take care of this for today.

526
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,620
Farewell!

527
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,220
Hey, don't run!

528
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,860
I want to laugh!

529
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,900
I can't help it if there's no one to fight against!

530
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,760
Go!

531
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,140
A giant Nymph!

532
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,940
Farewell!

533
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,100
Hey, wait!

534
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
What's going to happen to the land of the Six Seasons?

535
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,400
Can you trust a traitor like Horokoro?

536
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,220
Don't make him your disciple!

537
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,280
I'm not joking!

538
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,420
Hey, wait!

539
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,060
Stop!

540
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,880
Hey, Yu!

541
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,520
Our ship sank because of you!

542
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,260
Let's eat!

543
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,580
That's right!

544
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm not joking!

545
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,780
Wait!

546
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,000
Why am I the only one...

547
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,760
Lord!

548
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,100
Senpai!

549
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm sorry.

550
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,920
It's my grandpa's fault.

551
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,900
No, it's my dad's fault.

552
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,960
Help me!

553
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,140
I hate ninjas!

554
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,960
Traffic Safety Market!

555
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,160
You're Ishizu Tetsuo!

556
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,740
Traffic Safety Market!

557
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,100
There's quiver and nine in this area already!

558
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,040
Besides, look at those armor-wearing foto!

559
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,980
