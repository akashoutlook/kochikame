17
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,360
Hmm... you're right, it's a turtle.

18
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,500
Because it's a turtle-slaying park...

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,820
It's for me, but I think a deer should be better.

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,240
Even so, the director gives us

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,100
quite an absurd command to think about a new character.

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,260
I've got work, too.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
Ryo is going to be late every day, getting reside in the office.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,880
He's not convincing at all.

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,720
I'm cut.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,220
Yeah, I got it!

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,260
You're really quick, Sasugawa-senpai!

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,820
How's this? This is my new mascot in the Katsushika office, Kuma-wari-kun!

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,760
Huh?

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,660
I've made a new, soft character that's more like a police officer and a lovely bear,

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,940
and I've also made a new, soft character that's more like a police officer and a lovely bear,

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,240
and I've also made a new, soft character that's more like a police officer and a lovely bear,

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,460
and this will make the president very satisfied!

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
The people of the city will definitely like it!

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,660
I'm a genius, after all!

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,520
Ahahaha!

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,940
Kuma-wari-kun, huh?

38
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
I'm sure everyone will like it.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,300
I'm sure everyone will like it!

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,300
I'm sure everyone will like it!

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,100
Fight, Kuma-wari-kun!

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,420
I'm Kuma-wari-kun!

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,860
I'll protect your city, Kuma!

44
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,220
Please take a look.

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,180
This is Kuma, the police officer of Kuma, who has just become the new mascot of the Katsushika office.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,640
Nice to meet you, Kuma!

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,420
Nice to meet you, Kuma!

48
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,420
Kuma-wari-kun is very popular among the children.

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,140
I'm looking forward to his future activities.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Look!

51
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,120
You're quite handsome, no matter how much you say it.

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
No, thank you for the compliment.

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,040
You're really popular, aren't you?

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,100
The costume was hard, wasn't it?

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,180
Ryo-chan, you're wearing it, aren't you?

56
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,060
Yeah.

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,140
I didn't want to wear it, either, but there was no one else.

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
But I won't wear it again.

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,640
The children are so pretty, and the costume is so pretty.

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,200
It was hot and terrible.

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
It's proof that the children love you, isn't it?

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,880
You have to be happier.

63
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,460
That's right.

64
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,800
The Katsushika office has been fully backed up.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,660
Kuma-wari-kun's popularity will continue to rise.

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,620
Kuma-wari-kun's height, weight, favorite food, special skills, and even the name of his friends.

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,420
Did you think of all this?

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,640
Of course.

69
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,500
To pursue reality.

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,600
And recently, children are used to such settings in games and comics.

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,320
I didn't notice that.

72
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,620
Well, if I get a little serious, it's that simple.

73
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,560
It's impossible for the chief to talk about it.

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,780
What's wrong with me?

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,200
Chief!

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,880
I told you to come to the office, but what the hell do you think your job is?

77
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,140
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,200
Everyone listen to me.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,060
The chief ordered me to go to kindergarten with Kuma-wari-kun.

80
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,420
Kindergarten?

81
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes.

82
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,280
Kuma-wari-kun is going to campaign for public safety.

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,700
Listen, Ryozu.

84
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,660
Kuma-wari-kun is not only the mascot of the Katsushika office, but also the hero of the children.

85
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,240
Don't ruin the dreams of the children.

86
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:39,900
What?

87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,060
You mean I'm going to wear a costume again?

88
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,560
I don't like that.

89
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,740
Idiot!

90
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,740
You're Kuma-wari-kun's father, aren't you?

91
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,660
That's ridiculous.

92
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm giving you an order.

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
I got it.

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,320
No, you're not.

95
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,700
I'm not going to give you a rude greeting.

96
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,280
I got it, Kuma.

97
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,800
Kuma-wari-kun is going to campaign from now on.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,180
Okay.

99
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,940
Everyone, Kuma-wari-kun is here today from the Katsushika office.

100
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's say hello to him.

101
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:11,980
Yes.

102
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,160
Hello.

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,600
Hello.

104
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,820
Everyone, hello, Kuma.

105
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,940
I'm Kuma-wari-kun, Kuma.

106
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,120
Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,180
Wow, he's real Kuma-wari-kun.

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,760
Wow, he's fluffy.

109
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,060
He's bigger than I saw on TV.

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,980
Let me touch him, too.

111
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,140
Everyone, Kuma is fine and healthy.

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,600
It's troublesome.

113
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,260
He's hot and his children are annoying.

114
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,300
Ouch!

115
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,440
Hey, don't pull me.

116
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,000
Who kicked me?

117
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,240
Ouch!

118
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,660
You idiot!

119
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,960
You're a mascot loved by children.

120
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,460
You can't be serious.

121
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,340
Ouch!

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,960
Kuma-wari-kun, are you okay?

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
Don't worry, Kuma.

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,380
Kuma-wari-kun is very strong.

125
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,700
He can do anything, Kuma.

126
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,800
Amazing.

127
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,160
Then, let's learn traffic rules together, Kuma.

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:09,740
Okay.

129
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,120
I'll go.

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,340
See you later, Kuma.

131
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,100
You're so popular.

132
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,340
You're like a big kid.

133
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,440
That's true.

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,120
Kuma-wari-kun, we brought you a present.

135
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,060
Hey, everyone.

136
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,680
Yes.

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,300
Really?

138
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:23,740
Kuma?

139
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm so happy.

140
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,460
For the cabbage.

141
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,160
Yes.

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,460
It says here that your favorite is the cabbage.

143
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,580
I know Kuma-wari-kun.

144
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,980
I know everything about you.

145
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
I want to eat a lot of my favorite cabbage.

146
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,840
I want to do it with everyone.

147
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,720
Eat it.

148
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
I don't need anything.

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,980
Wait a minute.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,580
Is Kumari's favorite cabbage?

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,260
I think I've thought about that.

152
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,140
Don't think about it.

153
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,420
If this happens, take responsibility and eat it all.

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
It's too much.

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,060
Are you trying to break the dreams of the children?

156
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,040
Look at those children's eyes.

157
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,840
I don't think there's anyone in there.

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,240
I believe that he is a creature called Kumari.

159
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,300
Do you betray such a pure feeling?

160
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,380
But...

161
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,120
You're a big animal.

162
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Thank you, bear.

163
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,640
I'm impressed, bear.

164
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,840
I'll enjoy it.

165
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Remember that, boss.

166
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,900
The car has stopped, so I'll cross it quickly.

167
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,020
Chikuwa.

168
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,200
You're wrong.

169
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,420
You have to check your left and right and raise your hand to cross.

170
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,040
But I've never seen a man cross like that.

171
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,200
What are you trying to say?

172
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,660
You are the Hero of the Children.

173
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,420
I understand.

174
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,620
Then, let's cross by raising our hands.

175
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,320
Yes, sir.

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Hey.

177
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,400
You have to stop while raising your hands, bear.

178
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
In the same way, there are some people in the city who do not follow the traffic rules.

179
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
So be careful, bear.

180
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,980
Yes!

181
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,160
But, Kumawari-kun is strong, so he's stronger than a car.

182
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,120
Huh?

183
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,560
That's right.

184
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,500
It says here that Kumawari-kun is strong enough to lift trucks easily.

185
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,140
No, no, that's just a setting.

186
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,760
Amazing! I want to see it!

187
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,640
If it's a car like that, you can lift it with one hand, right?

188
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,380
Huh?

189
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,000
Let me see it!

190
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,320
Kumawari-kun, let me see it.

191
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,240
Huh?

192
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,480
I know, Ryotsu. It's for the children.

193
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,120
I-I understand, Kuma.

194
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,640
Why did you do this?

195
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,640
How is it, Kuma?

196
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,400
Kumawari-kun is very strong, Kuma.

197
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,980
Just kidding!

198
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,440
Here, a reward.

199
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,940
Thank you.

200
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,840
Alright, I want to see the next Kumawari kick!

201
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,960
Kumawari kick?

202
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,340
It's your special move, right?

203
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,800
It's also written here.

204
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,080
You can defeat a bull with a kick, right?

205
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,600
I want to see more!

206
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,420
Me, too!

207
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,540
Can you beat me with a bull?

208
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,740
Kick! Kick! Kick! Kick!

209
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,500
Well, as long as your kick is good, I guess.

210
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,260
It's just your same move.

211
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll show you my special technique that crushes concrete.

212
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,540
Chana-sensei, come here.

213
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,420
Chana-sensei.

214
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,920
Chana-sensei.

215
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,700
Who is it?

216
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,040
Chana-sensei is doing kickboxing.

217
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
Chana-sensei is ranked third in the world.

218
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,400
What?

219
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,360
Chana-sensei.

220
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,880
Nice to meet you.

221
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,120
Chana-sensei.

222
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,480
Chana-sensei.

223
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm not kidding. I can fight with this.

224
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,640
Don't run, Ryotsu. The children are watching.

225
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,460
I can't win.

226
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,020
But you're a true hero.

227
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,200
Come on.

228
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,660
Don't leave me alone.

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,440
Chara!

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,480
Chara.

231
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,100
Chara.

232
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,500
Chara.

233
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,340
Chara!

234
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,560
Chara.

235
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:36,760
No.

236
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,020
No.

237
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,640
Don't leave me alone.

238
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,540
Let me see.

239
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,120
Chara.

240
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm counting on you, Kuma.

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,180
Damn, you're so selfish.

242
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,700
Hey, hey, onee-chan,

243
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,880
is Tanooki-kun not coming today?

244
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,740
Eh? Tanooki-kun?

245
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,540
You don't know him? He's Kumawari-kun's subordinate.

246
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,540
He always makes mistakes and

247
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,020
always makes trouble for Kumawari-kun.

248
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,300
He's a pain in the ass.

249
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,540
I want to see Tanooki-kun too.

250
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,640
I want to see him! I want to see him!

251
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,960
I want to see him! I want to see him!

252
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,920
Leave it to me, Kuma!

253
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,520
Tanooki-kun will be here soon, Kuma!

254
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,200
Really?

255
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Really, Kuma! I'm waiting for you, Kuma!

256
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,260
What?

257
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:25,400
What is it?

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Well...

259
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Everyone!

260
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,000
It's Tanooki!

261
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kuma!

262
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,460
My subordinate is always a pain in the ass and

263
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,140
always makes trouble for me!

264
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,860
It's Tanooki, Kuma!

265
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,460
R-Ryosuke-sama...

266
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,460
Hey, hey, Tanooki-kun, you have a small voice, Kuma.

267
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,380
Then you won't be heard by everyone, Kuma!

268
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,640
What did you say?

269
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,820
Tanooki-kun!

270
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,660
Are you sure?

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
Your dream of being a child will be broken.

272
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Then everyone,

273
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,080
let's go!

274
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
I'll call Tanooki-kun with a loud voice, Kuma!

275
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,580
I'm sure Tanooki-kun will answer with energy, Kuma!

276
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,060
Now, one, two, three!

277
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,700
Tanooki-kun!

278
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,720
Tanu!

279
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,580
I'm so happy to meet you all today, Tanu!

280
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,460
Let's study the traffic rules together, Tanu!

281
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,340
Yes!

282
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,580
Chief Okinoda...

283
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,140
Ryo-chan gets on my nerves right away...

284
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,220
I had fun today, Kuma!

285
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,660
I-I'll come play again, Tanu!

286
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,060
Are you leaving already?

287
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,880
I want to play more!

288
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,660
Hey, hey, it's okay, right?

289
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,680
It's a shame, but we have to go back to the secret base, Kuma!

290
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,500
The secret base?

291
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,420
That's right!

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,960
It's written that we live in a secret base somewhere in this town!

293
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,160
That's right, Kuma!

294
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,160
Then, everyone, see you again, Kuma!

295
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,380
Bye-bye! See you later!

296
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,160
Bye-bye!

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,180
Bye-bye!

298
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,200
Bye-bye!

299
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,100
Bye-bye!

300
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,300
Bye-bye!

301
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,560
Ehehe...

302
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,780
Chief, you can take it off now, right?

303
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,420
No, not yet.

304
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,800
I need to get away from the kindergarten a little more.

305
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,500
Okay, that's enough.

306
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,120
Yay!

307
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,280
I can finally say goodbye to this hot and painful costume...

308
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,620
Huh? The jacket...

309
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,020
Huh? Huh? Huh?

310
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm finally relieved.

311
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,140
Thank you for your hard work.

312
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,760
Thank you.

313
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,520
It was so hot.

314
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,440
But it's for the children.

315
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
This is also inevitable.

316
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,300
Hey!

317
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,280
Hey, Renko Nakagawa!

318
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,080
Help me out, too!

319
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

320
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,880
Huh?

321
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,040
Ryo, wait!

322
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,820
Look!

323
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,340
Huh?

324
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,680
Oh, I found you, Kumaori!

325
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,120
Hurry up!

326
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,540
Hey, you!

327
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,100
You can't run away like this!

328
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,940
Damn it!

329
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,700
Oh, he ran away!

330
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,200
Wait!

331
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,360
Damn it!

332
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,720
Why?

333
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,160
Let's play again!

334
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,420
Why should I run away?

335
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,540
Wait!

336
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,740
I'm sorry, Kuma!

337
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,080
Oh, no!

338
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,280
I'll be out of here soon!

339
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,660
Oh, no!

340
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,360
Oh, no!

341
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,720
I ran from here for the first time in a long time!

342
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,780
But I have no idea what happened to me!

343
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,560
What should I do?

344
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,260
What should I do?

345
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,220
What?

346
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,680
Oh, Ryo?

347
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,320
Just, do not run after me!

348
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,660
No, Ryo.

349
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,900
Ryo, my sweet boy, just run or I'll kill you!

350
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,660
Okay, everyone,

351
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,060
Ryo, take my sister to go.

352
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Yes! He's very cute!

353
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,740
He's cool!

354
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,420
He's strong!

355
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,100
He's a hero!

356
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,480
I see. You like him that much.

357
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,740
Do you want to play with me that much?

358
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,200
Me?

359
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,500
What do you want to play with? Do you want to play with me? Which do you want to play with?

360
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,840
I want to play with you!

361
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,200
Then come with me, bear!

362
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,780
Yes!

363
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,940
My name is bear-bear.

364
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,740
Bear!

365
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone protects this town.

366
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,240
Bear!

367
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,960
When I'm buried, I'm a bear-bear.

368
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,460
Bear!

369
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,000
Everyone's hero, bear-bear!

370
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,700
Wow!

371
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,660
Bear, you're watching well.

372
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,000
This kind of hard to grab doll is aimed at the thin part, bear.

373
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
Wow! I got four!

374
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,580
I, I've never seen anything like this before.

375
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,420
Bear-bear is amazing!

376
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,620
He's a little boy.

377
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,260
But there's nothing about the fact that he's good at crane games.

378
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,580
This is the real me, bear!

379
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,300
Today, I'm going to play with you guys.

380
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,700
I'll show you how to do it, bear!

381
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,400
No!

382
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,240
There are more rice balls than other restaurants in Taiyaki.

383
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,520
Bear, remember this.

384
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,420
Yes!

385
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,560
My name is bear-bear.

386
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,260
Bear!

387
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,660
Everyone's hero, bear-bear.

388
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,520
Bear!

389
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,500
Everyone's hero, bear-bear.

390
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Bear!

391
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,500
Hey, Ozaki! How are you, bear?

392
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,940
Oh, I'm...

393
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,380
Oh, I'm...

394
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,740
I'm Zenzo!

395
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm the first idol of Shikasha, bear-bear!

396
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,700
Are you Ryu?

397
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm Ryosan!

398
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,800
Bear!

399
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm Kumaari-kun, now!

400
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,220
I don't know those people!

401
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,960
Got it?

402
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,180
Yeah!

403
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,640
Everyone's happy, bear!

404
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,780
This old man will give everyone a present!

405
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,880
Bear!

406
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,760
What are you talking about, Ryosan?

407
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,840
It's Kumaari-kun!

408
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,480
Put Daikin on Katsushika-cho!

409
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,640
Got it?

410
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,380
Y-You get it.

411
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,320
The unbalance of a smiling teddy bear and a loud voice is scary.

412
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,480
My name is Kumaari-kun!

413
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,840
Kuma!

414
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,440
Everyone in this town is protected by Kuma!

415
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,180
Kuma!

416
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,540
Ah!

417
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,840
You idiot!

418
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,880
What are you doing, you bastard?

419
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,480
I-I'm sorry...

420
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,460
Aiki-sama, what are you doing to a child?

421
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,380
W-what are you?

422
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,940
My name is Kumawari-kun!

423
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,980
What is Kumawari-kun?

424
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,120
Uwaaah!

425
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,100
Damn it! I'm angry!

426
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,040
Uwaaah!

427
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,980
I'm done for!

428
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,400
Done for...

429
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,180
No!

430
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,980
That's so cool!

431
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,040
As expected, Kumawari-kun is our hero!

432
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,180
Ahahaha!

433
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,700
My name is Kumawari-kun!

434
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:44,960
Ah!

435
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,500
Everyone in this town is protected by Kuma!

436
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,140
Protected by Kuma!

437
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,800
Kumaari-kun, bye-bye!

438
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,640
Let's play again!

439
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,360
Bye-bye, Kuma!

440
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,540
Hey, I'm tired.

441
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,580
I've been crying all day because of Kumaari-kun...

442
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,180
Senpai!

443
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,640
I washed Kumaari-kun!

444
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,380
Oh, sorry.

445
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,360
Please dry it for me.

446
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:07,900
Okay.

447
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,480
It was hard to put this on all day.

448
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,680
Oh, but...

449
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,080
Well, it's okay.

450
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,200
Sometimes, that kind of outfit...

451
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,540
Ah, it's morning already.

452
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,480
Ah, I'm going to sleep a little more.

453
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,560
Huh?

454
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,760
What?

455
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:34,800
What's wrong?

456
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,360
Ah!

457
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,500
Kumaari-kun!

458
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,480
Kumaari-kun!

459
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:37,920
No!

460
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,060
Don't die!

461
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,640
Oh, no!

462
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,500
Ah!

463
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,960
Kumaari-kun is...

464
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,540
He's dead!

465
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
Senpai, what should we do?

466
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,800
I think Kumaari-kun is dead.

467
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,820
Anyway, we have to take it back and fool him!

468
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,700
Damn it!

469
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm gonna break it!

470
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,620
What?

471
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,380
Ah!

472
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,680
Ah!

473
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,520
It's falling!

474
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:01,980
Ah!

475
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:02,700
Ah!

476
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,200
Ah!

477
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,660
Ah!

478
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,500
I got hit.

479
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,560
Ah!

480
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,260
Kumaari-kun is dead!

481
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,180
No!

482
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:11,800
No!

483
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,000
We can't help it!

484
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,520
No!

485
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,720
Found you again!

486
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,700
You!

487
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,660
Wait!

488
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,960
Ah!

489
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,780
Where did he go?

490
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,360
I think he should have come here, no?

491
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,480
He's so sad!

492
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,940
What's wrong!?

493
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,020
Kumaari-kun is...

494
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,360
Huh?

495
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,100
Huh?

496
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,880
Damn it!

497
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,780
Senpai!

498
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,060
Take it!

499
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,440
No!

500
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,480
Honda, we're counting on you!

501
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,360
Please be careful.

502
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,720
Here I go!

503
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,500
Good luck, Senpai!

504
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,900
It's Kumawari!

505
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't go!

506
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,700
Kumawari!

507
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Revive, Kumawari!

508
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,620
Kumawari!

509
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,360
You're alive!

510
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,400
Wow!

511
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,500
As expected of Senpai.

512
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,480
Idiot!

513
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,440
We've been hearing that you're in trouble since this morning.

514
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,300
What were you doing?

515
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,880
I was just chasing after the toys.

516
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,620
You're not in control.

517
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,880
The Chief said that you're not the same as you are now.

518
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,560
What are you going to do?

519
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm not the one who was blown away by the wind.

520
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,100
Don't make excuses.

521
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,220
Come on, improve your image of Kumawari.

522
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,040
If you fail, you'll have to go to the constitution.

523
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,180
I can't do that.

524
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,160
Why are you doing this?

525
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,100
If you can improve your image so easily, you won't have to suffer.

526
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,080
You keep saying things that the Chief wants you to do.

527
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,420
It's Kumawari!

528
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
What are you doing?

529
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,480
Let's play together!

530
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,080
Sorry, I can't get used to it.

531
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,060
What's wrong?

532
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,960
You don't look well.

533
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,620
What's wrong?

534
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,320
Actually...

535
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,880
I see.

536
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,760
You failed.

537
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,500
I always fail when I'm perfect.

538
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,120
Cheer up!

539
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,240
Kumawari, you're so poor.

540
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,040
Okay, okay.

541
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,960
Thank you, Kuma.

542
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,340
But it's not good to do this.

543
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,440
We have to improve our image somehow.

544
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,560
What do you mean?

545
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,800
For example, we have to show people that we're working harder.

546
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,700
If we help everyone, we might be popular.

547
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,360
That's right.

548
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,680
If Kumawari catches the culprit, everyone will be surprised.

549
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,880
Are you going to give us a chance?

550
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,900
But are you going to be that good?

551
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,920
You have to try it.

552
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,120
I have to try it.

553
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,620
Good luck, Kumawari!

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,600
Good luck!

555
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,600
Good luck!

556
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,580
Even if you say that, it's not easy for a criminal to show up.

557
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,540
Thief!

558
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,820
That's right.

559
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,800
A thief suddenly...

560
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,160
What?

561
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,540
Oh!

562
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,020
Isn't that a thief?

563
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,460
It looks like it.

564
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,200
It's a chance, Kumawari!

565
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,480
Good luck!

566
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,620
Leave it to me!

567
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,420
Look at me!

568
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,560
I'll show you the real power of Kumawari!

569
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,180
I'll show you the real power of Kumawari!

570
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,600
I'll show you the real power of Kumawari!

571
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,140
I'll show you the real power of Kumawari!

572
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,580
I'll show you the real power of Kumawari!

573
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,340
Hey, don't let it go!

574
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,580
What's going on?

575
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,620
What's wrong with you?

576
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,360
What does Kumawari look like?

577
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,420
It's not just Kumawari!

578
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,400
It's Kumawari!

579
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,820
It's Kumawari!

580
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:18,940
What?

581
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,700
That's bad!

582
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,600
I'll arrest you!

583
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,120
You're so small.

584
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,400
You'll be in trouble!

585
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,560
What are you doing, Kuma!?

586
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
Oh, no...

587
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,340
Oh, my!

588
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,960
I won't let you run away!

589
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,300
If I don't do that, I'll arrest you, Kuma!

590
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,360
What?!

591
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,820
Oh, no!

592
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,840
I found you, Kuma!

593
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,580
Oh, no!

594
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,380
り

595
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,440
Kumawari!

596
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,700
What's going on?

597
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,520
Wait for me, bear!

598
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,460
Looks like they ran away.

599
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,100
That was close.

600
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,340
But what was that bear doing?

601
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,200
What was that voice?

602
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,160
I think they came here.

603
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,420
Oh, that's...

604
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,960
That's Kumawari-kun's...

605
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,440
Kumawari-kun!

606
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,480
Everyone, you did it, bear!

607
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,180
That's scary!

608
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,140
That's not Kumawari-kun!

609
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,580
Mom!

610
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,000
What? Why, bear?

611
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,280
You idiot!

612
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,600
What's this picture?

613
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,620
I-It can't be helped!

614
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,220
I was so obsessed with arresting the culprit!

615
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,500
That's why I was told to take a picture like this!

616
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,700
You idiot!

617
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,960
This picture is really terrible.

618
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,180
It's impossible for a child to cry.

619
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,360
Hey, Kumawari-san!

620
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,360
Where's Kumawari-kun?

621
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,620
Hey, you guys!

622
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,020
Ta-da!

623
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,220
Wow, so cute!

624
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,520
You guys!

625
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,880
Kumawari-kun's costume set!

626
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,660
From today, we're also Kumawari-kun!

627
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,180
We're going to be Kumawari-kun!

628
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,500
I was a little scared, but...

629
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,660
Kumawari-kun is our hero!

630
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,840
Wow!

631
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
You guys!

632
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,460
See you!

633
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,400
Bye!

634
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,020
What's going on?

635
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,500
Chief, I'm going on patrol!

636
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,420
I'll be waiting, bear!

637
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
I'll play with you today, bear!

638
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,560
Yay!

639
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,480
I'm going this way!

640
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,500

puppy

643
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,740
It's okay to be poor

644
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,960
Isn't that right?

645
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,740
Just do it the way I want to do it

646
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,720
Nice!

647
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,700

That's better

650
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,140
All right

651
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,920
All right

652
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,280

The one who needs me now is Maria!

662
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,660
You taught me a lot of important things!

663
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,060
One last thing, okay?

664
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,140
Listen up! What is that strange bunch of people?
