make your room bright

15
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,840

Ahahaha

59
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,360
If you don't have a job, come to my place

60
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one, but don't worry

61
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,360
Look, it's burning

62
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,980
The red cloud is burning

63
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,140
I wonder what will happen

64
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,340
Do you understand?

65
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,360
I understand, I understand

66
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,760
If you understand, keep quiet and follow me

67
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,540
I understand, I understand

68
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,520
Ryo's Double Facial Expression

69
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,340
What's wrong, Senpai?

70
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,760
What is that "K"?

71
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
This magazine's article

72
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,700
I don't know if it's handsome or not

73
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,480
But what is the relationship between sports and a good face?

74
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Ah, that's it

75
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm sure you'll get a lot of fans.

76
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,880
There are people who are almost like TV talents.

77
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,880
Shut up!

78
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,160
What's good about sports and what's good about your face are completely different things.

79
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,940
What happens if you become a hot spot for your fans and you can't get into sports?

80
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,120
Well...

81
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,240
That's true, but...

82
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,160
You're a sports player, so it's more important than whether you have a good face or not.

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,920
Sports and what's good about your face have nothing to do with each other.

84
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,460
Humans are not faces.

85
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,920
It's important to know what they did and how good they are.

86
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,900
I think you're right.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Ryo-chan is a little...

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,800
B-B-We are the boy scouts.

89
00:02:59,480 --> 00:02:59,640
What?

90
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,340
Hello there.

91
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,240
It's been a while.

Professor Ezeki.

93
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,220
You're wearing some stuff, aren't you?

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
How old are you and what are you wearing?

95
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
I'm not a gorilla.

96
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I'm a...

97
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,540
A double-faced monster!

98
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
Hehehe...

101
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,300
Huh?

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,580
You're singing the wrong thing in the middle, aren't you?

103
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,920
That's the finger five!

104
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,860
What's the point of the "Kaijin Nijumensou" singing "The Boys Detective Squad's" song?

105
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,180
I don't care about the details.

106
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,080
I'll give this to you.

107
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,140
Huh?

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,580
This is the "BD Badge."

109
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,860
That's why I said the "BD Badge" is the "Kaijin Nijumensou's" song, not the "Kaijin Nijumensou's" song!

110
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,720
I can't keep up with the maniacal topics.

111
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,740
Me too.

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
By the way, what are you doing here today?

113
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,580
You're just pretending to be asleep, so I guess it has something to do with the two-faced monster.

114
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,420
That's a different story, Gorilla-kun!

115
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,580
Our super-brain has also made a huge invention by chance!

116
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,980
A huge invention?

117
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,340
A HENTAI MASK!

118
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,100
A HENTAI MASK!?

119
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,100
If you put this mask on your face, what will happen is...

120
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,580
What's this?

121
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,580
It's stuck perfectly, and I can't take it off!

122
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,480
What are you going to do!? It hurts!

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,940
No problem!

124
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,220
Like this...

125
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,280
What are you doing?

126
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,380
Like this...

127
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,520
Like this...

128
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,400
It's strange.

129
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,620
What!?

130
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,720
He looks just like the manager!

131
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,920
Like this...

132
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
Like this...

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,080
Like this...

134
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,580
You're still surprised?

135
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,040
This time, I'm going to do this!

136
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,500
This time, you're the manager!

137
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,120
I see.

138
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,880
If you put this HENTAI MASK on, any face will be free!

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,300
Gorilla-kun will have 20 faces, 20...

140
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,540
No, 200 faces!

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
He's a super-brain man!

142
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,620
How about that, Gorilla-kun?

143
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,480
Isn't it interesting?

144
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,900
Umm..

145
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
Like this...

146
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,800
I hope this way...

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,100
Well...

148
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,500
You're Reiko-san, eh?

149
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
Uh...! Stop it! It's so disgusting!

150
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,880
You look like you're FM-ing at the camera.

151
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,200
Well, how do I take this mask off?

152
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,580
Phew...

153
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,880
That's for the next time.

154
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,020
The next time? What do you mean?

155
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,840
It's a fun time until we meet again.

156
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,880
Hey, hey!

157
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,520
Goodbye, Kyendai-chikun!

158
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,920
If you say that, I'll beat you to death!

159
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,080
Damn it! What's going on with this face?!

160
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,420
Coming soon!

161
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,720
He's still unresponsive!

162
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,020
I'm sure he still doesn't know how to take off his mask.

163
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,140
I'm sure so.

164
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,240
Mr. Nakagawa!

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you need anything from me, ladies?

166
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,100
Mr. Nakagawa, is your schedule free this Sunday?

167
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,860
Would you like to drive with me?

168
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,580
That's right.

169
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,780
I'll take my special Ferrari and have a good time at 1:00 midnight.

170
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,040
Let's have a coffee at dawn.

171
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,880
That's so cool!

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,700
That's what I'm talking about.

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,160
We don't have time for you.

174
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,380
You, Ryōtsu!

175
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
You're impossible to fool with your eyes.

176
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,640
Of course not.

177
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,040
I just pretended to be on your side.

178
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,040
What kind of trick is this?

179
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
How could you do that to me?

180
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,860
You're not good enough for me.

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,540
This is a new toy for you, Ryō.

182
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Please, don't do that to me.

183
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,180
Well, I thought you were a fool.

184
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,840
I thought it was just a joke.

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,040
You're the worst!

186
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,580
I have some good money.

187
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,180
Actually, I have a special mission for you.

188
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,220
Special mission?

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Yes. From today onwards, you will be assigned to the Special Police Department.

190
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,640
S-Special Police Department?

191
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes. You will be assigned to the department where there are no other people.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
So there are no other people.

193
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,200
But I don't have any special skills.

194
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,860
No, you do!

195
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,300
You may not have noticed it yourself, but you are a very special person.

196
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,980
That is because you are very stubborn.

197
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,700
So from today onwards, you will be called "Fundoshi Deka".

198
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,840
F-F-Fundoshi Deka?

199
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,620
What does that have to do with being stubborn?

200
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,020
If you want to be stubborn, you have to be a stubborn father.

201
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,980
And a stubborn father...

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
There is no such thing as a stubborn father who always reaches out for money!

203
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,120
We have done a thorough survey of the charges filed by public officials nationwide.

204
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,600
And, among all the police officers in Japan,

205
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,280
you're one of the people who are the most suitable for being a stubborn father!

206
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,820
Yes...

207
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,180
I don't think they would say you have a problem.

208
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,960
But that is...

209
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,220
Then hurry up and change into those uniforms!

210
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,320
Yes sir!

211
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Ah...

212
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,740
I-is this all right?

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,680
Hmm, well, it's fine.

214
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,920
But what if someone who is a special detective is embarrassed?

215
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,900
Be more honest and honest.

216
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,560
Yes!

217
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,900
But just the look alone doesn't make you feel like a special detective.

218
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,500
Here's a scene with a factory you promised to appear in.

219
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Let's make it a scene.

220
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,180
Ah...

221
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,900
Yes!

222
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
"A man comes to town in a red hood."

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,260
"A man comes and goes, and a man comes and goes."

224
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,520
"The special detective of the police station, Daijiro Ohara."

225
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,680
"He calls for someone."

226
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,740
"A big hood!"

227
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,880
Hmm, I'm starting to get the hang of it.

228
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,740
But I'm still not sure how to move it properly.

229
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,360
When you turn, you have to go like this.

230
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,360
You can't go around like this.

231
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,880
Ah, yes.

232
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,740
And the important pose is like this.

233
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,740
Raise your right elbow properly, and stretch your legs as much as you can.

234
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,540
Ah, yes.

235
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,960
Well, you can practice here for a while.

236
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,380
Oh.

237
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,580
You can do it properly now, so come to the chief's office.

238
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,620
Yes, sir!

239
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
If you can't do this properly,

240
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,200
you'll have to live in a very tough way in the era of the restaurant.

241
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,420
Okay.

242
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,340
Well then, I'll be looking forward to it.

243
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,520
I'll be waiting for you.

244
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,400
Hehehe...

245
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,140
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,380
I'm Ohara.

247
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,420
Come in.

248
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,880
Excuse me.

249
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,800
Mr. Ohara!

250
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,180
Please, have a look, chief.

251
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,720
This time I'm going to make a perfect decision.

252
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,640
He came to the town with a big

253
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:15,460
How is it, chief?

254
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,380
Will this connect my neck?

255
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,900
Ohara-san gave all this to Ryo-san?

256
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,180
He's a rare person.

257
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,380
He's a rare person.

258
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,680
He's a rare person.

259
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,300
Please give me the money.

260
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,880
Yes, sir.

261
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,800
Please give me ten special sushi.

262
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,220
Five ramen, eight fried rice, and eight dumplings.

263
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,480
Please give me all of them.

264
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,640
Thanks to Mask, this is heaven.

265
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm just like the chief.

266
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,840
Well, who will I meet tomorrow?

267
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,500
I'll think about that tomorrow.

268
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,880
I can't. I'm late again.

269
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,800
I have to think of something.

270
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,520
Where is the uniform?

271
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,860
Where is the uniform?

272
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,760
Ah, there it is.

273
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,620
Oh, good morning, Yohoma-chan.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,460
What are you surprised about?

275
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,720
When did that person get in?

276
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,600
What?

277
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,520
I think I'm getting a lot of attention.

278
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
Good morning.

279
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,660
Good morning, Ryo-chan.

280
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,640
What are you surprised about?

281
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,380
It's Ryo-chan.

282
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,620
Of course.

283
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,900
What's wrong with your face?

284
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,960
I fell down.

285
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,340
What's wrong with your face?

286
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,600
What?

287
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,120
Is this my face?

288
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,620
Damn it.

289
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,680
So that's why everyone was surprised to see my face.

290
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:51,800
What?

291
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,840
Huh?

292
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,100
Huh?

293
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
What's wrong?

294
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,120
Your face is deformed.

295
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

296
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,660
It's kind of stiff like a mochi.

297
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,840
It must be a defective product.

298
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,600
It must be a defective product.

299
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,660
It's Professor Ezaki's invention.

300
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,600
It's Professor Ezaki's invention.

301
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,500
It's Professor Ezaki's invention.

302
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,740
Hello, everybody.

303
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,740
Ezaki, you!

304
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,640
What's going on?

305
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,660
What's going on?

306
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,060
What's going on?

307
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,440
What's going on?

308
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,660
What's going on?

309
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,540
I don't know.

310
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,180
What?

311
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,280
Pa?

312
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,140
That's not it.

313
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,600
Pa.

314
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,100
I will tell you why my face got so stiff!

315
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,220
No, it's still a couple of hours.

316
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,500
Two or three hours?

317
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,480
Two or three hours.

318
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,680
After two or three hours, it will be fully hardened

319
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,700
so I can peel off my selvata.

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,880
So you can peel it off, right, Gorilla-kun?

321
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,900
Until then.

322
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,520
You have to wait for a while with that face!

323
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,980
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

324
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,460
Farewell, Horm!

325
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,820
What the hell are you doing here?

326
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,480
But, can you really get away from me in a few hours?

327
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm not sure...

328
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, senpai, please take care of the night shift.

329
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,560
Huh?

330
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,620
It's better not to appear in front of people.

331
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,240
It's not good for the heart to see you for the first time.

332
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
Please don't make any strange noise.

333
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,360
I know.

334
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,380
Damn, was it the night shift today?

335
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,660
Even so, I can't take off my mask at all!

336
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,700
Um, where is the house of the newly married Amano-san?

337
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,340
What did you say?

338
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,000
Help!

339
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,300
Damn, he judged people by their faces.

340
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,960
That's what he said, but it's pretty amazing.

341
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,620
It's night, but I can't take off my mask at all.

342
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,180
I'll put it here until my face is back to normal.

343
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,740
Ugh, I'm hungry.

344
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,520
Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything since last night.

345
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,460
Hmm?

346
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
Hmm, I don't have anything.

347
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,540
I guess I'll go buy some ginger.

348
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,440
If I get robbed and stolen, it'll be terrible.

349
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,220
I only have a gun.

350
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,060
I'll eat this.

351
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:51,060
I really don't want to go to jail.

352
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm hungry.

353
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,660
OK.

354
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,440
I'll eat it anyway.

355
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,160
It's all you.

356
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,960
That's right, but when I was the only guest,

357
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,220
That's all I had.

358
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,640
Hmm?

359
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,020
I think it's this one.

360
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,180
Hmm?

361
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,600
I could see, "What's going on?"

362
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,500
Welcome!

363
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,700
Um, bento, bento...

364
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,300
Which should I choose?

365
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
Oh, it's wasabi-taro-mayonnaise!

366
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,920
I-I'm sorry! Please!

367
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,180
Will you give it to me?

368
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,380
Y-yes, please!

369
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,180
Thank you very much!

370
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,840
What are you doing? Please line up properly!

371
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,900
What?

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,160
Hey, you!

373
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,620
Do you have a problem?

374
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,240
You!

375
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,440
You're trying to ask me to do something!

376
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,100
No, I-I-I can't do that...

377
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,180
Don't bother me!

378
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,400
What?

379
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,520
I'll cut you to pieces!

380
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,860
Y-yes, sir!

381
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,440
You saved me!

382
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,020
I see.

383
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,280
Well, then.

384
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,600
This is awesome.

385
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,180
You're really something, big bro.

386
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,440
You really show off.

387
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,020
H-how is that face? It looks familiar.

388
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,020
What is this?

389
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,500
This is it!

390
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,660
This is the time when the Kyo-Waku Hand is in danger.

391
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,140
Please be careful.

392
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,220
Kyo-Waku Hand?

393
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,580
That sounds like a bad idea.

394
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,960
Well, I'm full now.

395
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,880
I'll go take a bath.

396
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
Welcome.

397
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,060
Here's 400 yen.

398
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,860
What are you looking at?

399
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,620
Suddenly, there are no customers.

400
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm lucky.

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm lucky.

402
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,740
Have fun.

403
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,980
The culprit has a gun.

404
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,980
Please be careful.

405
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,880
I'm going to the culprit.

406
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,060
This place is completely surrounded.

407
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,900
I can't run away anymore.

408
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,240
Drop your weapon and come out immediately.

409
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,900
Drop your weapon and come out immediately.

410
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Throw the grenade in 30 seconds.

411
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,760
Repeat.

412
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,920
Throw the grenade in 30 seconds.

413
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,220
It's kind of noisy outside.

414
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,220
I'm here.

415
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,620
Thank you for your hard work.

416
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,600
And the culprit is this man.

417
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
What? What's wrong?

418
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,000
This photo looks like Ryo-chan.

419
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,420
If that's the case, who is inside?

420
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,740
Ryo-chan?

421
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,040
What does that mean?

422
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,820
That's...

423
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,640
Time is running out.

424
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,740
Ryo-chan, you're out of time.

425
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,800
Ryo-chan, you're out of time.

426
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,520
Ryo-chan, you're out of time.

427
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,700
What?

428
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,060
What?

429
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,240
What?

430
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,340
I'm going to the culprit.

431
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,040
Drop your weapon and come out immediately.

432
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,940
What's going on?

433
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
This is...

434
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,760
I see.

435
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,020
He got it wrong.

436
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,700
Oh, no.

437
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,900
If I get caught with this face,

438
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,020
the chief will find out everything about yesterday's accident.

439
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,320
That's very bad.

440
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,200
He's out.

441
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,720
He's out.

442
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,040
He's running up the roof.

443
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,460
He even went to the learner's room.

444
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,300
Currently, the culprit is fleeing to the welfare building.

445
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,200
He is escaping to the welfare building.

446
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,520
It's bad!

447
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,320
Why does it show up here?

448
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,360
Rock with it!

449
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,960
You even used the police force!

450
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,540
Damn, I can't move!

451
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,420
I'm just like you!

452
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm just like you!

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,020
Who are you?!

454
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,600
You too!

455
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,920
You're the criminal of Shibete High!

456
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,300
Oh, crap!

457
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:46,760
Hey!

458
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,660
You bastard!

459
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,020
You bastard!

460
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,320
I thought it was weird.

461
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,600
I see.

462
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,160
So it was all Ryo's doing.

463
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,580
I knew it.

464
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,640
He used that mask.

465
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,740
He did that?

466
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,200
Hey!

467
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm doing this because of you!

468
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,960
This is...

469
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,860
Damn it!

470
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,420
Let go!

471
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm not letting go!

472
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Let go!

473
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,360
Ryo!

474
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,180
Which one?

475
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,380
I got it.

476
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,080
The mask...

477
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,180
What?

478
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,180
Get him!

479
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,940
Stop him!

480
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,000
What!?

481
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,440
I'm not getting rid of him!

482
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,040
Stop him!

483
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm not getting rid of him!

484
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,160
All right!

485
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm not the one!

486
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,100
I'm not!

487
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,440
Don't copy Ryo!

488
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,020
Don't copy me!!

489
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,760
I said I'm not!

490
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,720
You're so bald!

491
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,760
I forgot the mask, but I can't take it off.

492
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,920
It's a invention of Professor Ezaki after all.

493
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,200
It's personal gain.

494
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,860
It's better to be in the prison for the sake of me and the people.

495
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm wrong!

496
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,780
I failed the first test.

497
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,580
I failed the second test.

498
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,400
I failed the last test.

499
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,360
I failed the fourth one.

500
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,880
What's wrong with that?

501
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,920
All thechnolian.

502
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,540
I failed the third one.

503
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
I failed the fourth one.

504
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,000
I failed the fifth one.

505
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,960
I failed the sixth one.

506
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,360
I failed the seventh one.

507
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
I failed it again!

508
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,180
Why, I wonder?

509
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,320
Why, I wonder?

510
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,060
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

511
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:21,200
Why, I wonder, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

512
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
I got it!

513
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,380
I got it! The lottery that I bought with the 2,000 yen I borrowed from the manager is worth 1.4 billion yen!

514
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,560
I thought about it, but I dropped it in the bank vault I entered by the check.

515
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,220
Moreover, the deadline is tomorrow.

516
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,360
If this happens, I have no choice but to do it!

517
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,000
Next time, "Return the lottery!"

518
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,320
Thank you for watching!
