"Miyako's Room"

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,740
Those who have no money, come to me!

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,120
I hope you'll be able to do something about them.

7
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:57,560
When you have no job,

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,980
make your room bright and look away.

9
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,260
Those who have no money, come to me!

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,460
Look at the red clouds.

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,720
I hope you'll be able to do something about them.

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,320
I hope you'll be able to do something about them.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
I know, I know, I know.

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,000
If you know, then come to me quietly!

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,860
If you don't know, then follow me!

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:38,680
If you don't know, then follow me carefully!

"Giri and Ninjo's Little Hexing"

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,360
Caw, Caw, Caw!!

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,000
Go Go Go!

21
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,980
Go Go Go!

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,600
Stop it!

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
What are you doing?

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,560
Didn't you hear?

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,720
This is the place we first blocked, so I'm telling you to go somewhere else.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,120
What?

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,200
It's a lie.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,520
I've been staying here for three days.

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
I just went to the bathroom in the afternoon.

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,100
I just liked it for a moment.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
Fuku-e and the others got on it.

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
What? That newspaper was not garbage?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,960
What?

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,140
That's what he said.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,400
Ryo-tsu.

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,500
The park above is wide, so you can go anywhere.

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,980
That's right. Why are you so particular about this place?

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,200
I can only think that you are being a nuisance.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
I've been here since you guys were taking baths.

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
I've decided that I'll do it here.

41
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,780
No!

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,780
What?

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Ryo-tsu, you can't.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,720
Give up here and go somewhere else.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,360
You're too late.

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,060
Take a look!

47
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,580
The flowers are already in bloom.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,160
What's left is...

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,940
I'll do anything and everything here.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
Danko Soshi!

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:13,880
Yeah!

52
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,420
If you want to do that, I have an idea.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Let me see.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,280
What's he thinking?

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,760
There's no doubt it is something bad.

56
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,300
It's not good.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,800
If it's needed support Bul uda.

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,240
Stay here until the non- Kate геро lines stand out.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,560
Is he going to run away?

60
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,060
That means he's not having a drink or a snack.

61
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,000
He'll get it delivered here.

62
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,800
Nakagawa!

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,920
You're fighting a bad team again, Senpai.

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
Nakagawa doesn't understand my frustration.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,040
If they make a fuss, I think they'll get through their selfish demands.

66
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,940
So I can't help it.

67
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,960
Anyway, my parents spoiled me and raised me.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
I think it's a different story.

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm at your house.

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
I got a drink and snacks.

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,300
Are you sure you want to do that?

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,400
Yeah, it's a usual thing. Don't worry about it.

73
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Senpai, the baby is crying.

74
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,980
Baby?

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,380
What are you doing, Dad?

76
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,520
What did you come here for?

77
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,500
Hey, that's not it.

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,960
Don't touch Chiyoko with your dirty hands.

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,020
Chiyoko is Kinjirou's daughter.

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,780
Why is Chiyoko here?

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,640
Oh, she gave birth to a baby at your brother's place.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,940
At the wedding of the lawyer's daughter who was taken care of by Kinjirou,

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,140
I took care of Chiyoko today.

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Where did your mother go?

85
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,800
If your sister-in-law asks for a lunch box of Hanami, she'll be back soon.

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,780
You should have gone to the delivery room.

87
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,980
You shouldn't have said that.

88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,200
Hey, wake up.

89
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,340
Oh, you're so noisy.

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,300
I'll be back soon when I deliver the Hanami lunch box to Sasaki-san.

91
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,500
Please take care of Chiyoko for a while.

92
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,980
Huh? Chiyoko?

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,960
I see. You took care of her from Kinjirou's place.

94
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,220
It would be a big deal if you took her out and made her catch a cold.

95
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,000
Please take care of her.

96
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,260
Grandma is going out, Chiyoko.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,200
Bye-bye.

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,900
Wow, it's so warm.

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,040
She was sleeping quietly until a while ago, but I'm sure she's not sick.

100
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,680
It's warm, but not really.

101
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,020
Be strong, Kankichi.

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Are you a policeman?

103
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,620
Maybe the blanket is wet.

104
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,600
It's warm.

105
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,520
Kankichi, which one is better?

106
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,880
Whichever is fine, so hurry up and deliver it.

107
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,340
Chiyoko will catch a cold.

108
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,160
That's a big deal.

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,100
I've changed my mind about it.

110
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
I forgot about that long ago.

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,300
And I didn't have to wear this kind of hair in the past.

112
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,000
It's easy to do it now.

113
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,320
You're so stubborn.

114
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,740
Idiot!

115
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,760
Don't use dirty words in front of Chiyoko.

116
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
Which one is dirty?

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,080
What?

118
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,300
No, I was laughing.

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,940
No, I thought she was a parent.

120
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,660
Is she a parent?

121
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:43,800
She's not a parent.

122
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,920
What?

123
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,720
What's wrong, Chiyoko?

124
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,220
You must have been surprised because the two of you had a fight.

125
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,000
Kankichi.

126
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,540
We're both parents.

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Oh, no.

128
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,860
If you don't get along with each other, Chiyoko won't stop crying forever.

129
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,080
I can't help it.

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
I can't help it.

131
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,220
Let's take a break and pretend to be friends.

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,680
What?

133
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,120
You're laughing too, Kankichi.

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,620
Look, Chiyoko.

135
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,600
Grandpa and Kankichi are close.

136
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,260
You're treated differently than when I was a kid.

137
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,180
I don't know if I should punch a bad kid like you.

138
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,740
I don't know what you're talking about.

139
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
I don't know who you're talking about.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,160
What?

141
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,380
You have to raise a girl carefully.

142
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,640
He's serious.

143
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,240
It's too hot and too cold.

144
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,420
Here, Chiyoko, it's your meal.

145
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,400
Oh, my God.

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,540
He's a bad uncle.

147
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,280
Here, I made you a meal.

148
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,320
So, it's not that spicy.

149
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,600
You're going to be a great meal.

150
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,960
It's more important to keep up your English with Kinjirou and Keigo-san.

151
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,300
I'll teach you how to play the violin, and how to make tea or flowers.

152
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,520
Okay, Chiyoko?

153
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,220
Your grandchild is funny, isn't it?

154
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,900
He was a child who liked to drink sake and was famous for fighting, but he'snym on the other hand.

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,340
He's his first child, so I know he wouldn't hurt.

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,480
He'll hurt.

157
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,140
I thought you were a cute kid.

158
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,400
Senpai.

159
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,680
I was raised by someone who was so sweet.

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,100
Come on.

161
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,320
Is there something wrong?

162
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm just thinking about it.

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,800
You're quick-witted, Senpai.

164
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,360
It's said that the soul of a honeybee is up to 100.

165
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,520
From now on, you have to be sure that you don't do anything bad.

166
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,500
Hey, Kakichi. What are you going to do?

167
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
It's okay. I'm not as sweet as my grandpa.

168
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I'm not as sweet as my grandpa.

169
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,880
Senpai, you don't know what you're talking about when you say that at the end of the day.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,740
I'm going to be quick-witted.

171
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,900
You can't say that.

172
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,000
You're being so sweet even though you're a baby.

173
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm going to be quick-witted.

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:48,640
I'm going to be quick-witted.

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
It's cute.

176
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,900
It's so cute that it's hard to make sense of.

177
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,800
How was it? Was it fun, Chiyoko?

178
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,060
It was fun, wasn't it?

179
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,020
Damn.

180
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,960
It's a pity that I was beaten like a baby.

181
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,680
I hope you don't have to resist.

182
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,840
Senpai, I've always been telling you to leave it to cute things.

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,780
Well, I'm going to go back to the dressing room.

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
If you're going to say that, leave it to long things.

185
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,040
Sorry for calling you while I was sleeping.

186
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,380
Oh, you should show your face to Hanami.

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,800
I'm going over there at five.

188
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,060
Yes.

189
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,520
But are you okay, senpai?

190
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,740
Your father is alone.

191
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm going to go home by myself.

192
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,840
I'm going to go home by myself.

193
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,580
Even if it's just a little, I'm sure your mother will come back by then.

194
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,840
Listen to me, Yone-san.

195
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,440
I ate all the food I had secretly for the sake of time.

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,340
I ate all the food I had secretly for the sake of time.

197
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,020
That's a story I've heard somewhere.

198
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,720
Tenryu, originally, it was my money.

199
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,240
No matter what you use, you can't complain about it.

200
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,040
You should apologize honestly here.

201
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,440
What are you going to do about your promise to your grandchild?

202
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,960
Chiyoko?

203
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,160
I promised my grandchild to buy him a bicycle.

204
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,400
You two talk a lot.

205
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,560
Well, it's about time.

206
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,860
It's not just that, Yone-san.

207
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
Is there anything else?

208
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,080
Yes.

209
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,980
It's about time.

210
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,880
It's about time.

211
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,560
It's about time.

212
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:28,580
It's about time.

213
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,980
It's about time.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,580
It's about time.

215
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,100
It's about time.

216
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,860
It's about time.

217
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,620
It's about time.

218
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,960
It's about time.

219
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,240
It's about time.

220
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,940
It's about time.

221
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,540
It's about time.

222
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,040
Nineoe!

223
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,700
Nineoe!

224
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,520
Nineoe!

225
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,060
Nineoe!

226
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,220
Nineoe!

227
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,240
Nineoe!

228
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,580
Nineoe!

229
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,220
Nineoe!

230
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,100
Nineoe!

231
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,500
Damn it! I miscalculated the wind!

232
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,280
Is everyone okay?

233
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,840
Are you okay?

234
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,960
Are the enemies still fighting?

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,400
Aren't you stupid?

236
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,420
Don't stand behind me!

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,520
Oh, this year's also going to be good.

238
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,300
Ladies, please open the door.

239
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
What are you doing, old man?

240
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,480
Don't you have a cell phone?

241
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,920
I don't have such a thing.

242
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,560
I have a TV remote control.

243
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,960
I can't use it to my satisfaction.

244
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,960
That's right, Chiyoko.

245
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,960
I told you I'd be back soon.

246
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,980
Oh, it's been two or three hours.

247
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,680
Kankichi, you have work, don't you?

248
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,540
I'll take care of Chiyoko, so you can go.

249
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,400
I'm worried about my father alone, so I can't go.

250
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,960
Mom, please wait a minute.

251
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,300
It's my father.

252
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,780
Sen-dagi's Matsuda.

253
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,480
Hey, hey.

254
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,900
Masa.

255
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
Long time no see.

256
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,660
Oh, no, nothing at all.

257
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,460
All right.

258
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,700
That's a terrible story.

259
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,980
Are you doing it again?

260
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,260
Yes, that's an urgent matter.

261
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,400
I really want to join it.

262
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,520
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,740
What's Sendagi no Matsu?

264
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,360
An old friend of mine.

265
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,240
I owe him a life a long time ago.

266
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,340
You owe him a life?

267
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,540
Ouch!

268
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,840
Kankichi was about the age of Chiyoko.

269
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,300
I was a bit too young,

270
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,500
so I had a fight with a street kid.

271
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:34,980
Take this!

272
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Take it!

273
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,580
Take it!

274
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
Take it!

275
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,040
Sorry.

276
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,140
What's your name?

277
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,960
That was Sendagi no Matsu.

278
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,980
I've never heard of that.

279
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,500
I was just making you worry.

280
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,360
I never told Yone about it.

281
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,880
I heard that Sendagi no Matsu is now involved in a dangerous story.

282
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,140
A dangerous story?

283
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,880
So that call was to ask for help from your father?

284
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,540
Yes.

285
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,380
Really?

286
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,720
He owes you a life.

287
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,720
If I go, I'll be sorry if I don't.

288
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,840
Even your cute granddaughter

290
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,120
might never let go of your love.

291
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,300
I can't live with that...

292
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,020
That's right.

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,760
You're getting old,

294
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,720
and so you have to jump into the fire.

295
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,200
I owe you one thing.

296
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,420
Honestly,

297
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,760
this is a long time ago.

298
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,700
It's a personal hice.

299
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,360
What?

300
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,940
When did you become so unreasonable!?

301
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,960
Beg your pardon!

302
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,640
I told you that I'm not going!

303
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,600
Ouch!

304
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,880
Look, I put it on you and you fell asleep.

305
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:10,280
Hey, where are you going with that?

306
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,940
If you measure the size of a person, you can measure the size of a man.

307
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,140
Chiyoko, forgive my stupid grandpa.

308
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,420
I wanted to see your bride.

309
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,180
Are you serious?

310
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,300
Dad, Chiyoko, time!

311
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,220
Dad, Chiyoko, time!

312
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,760
Wait, dad!

313
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,480
What's wrong?

314
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you okay?

315
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't worry.

316
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,340
I was so excited that I suddenly felt better.

317
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,320
When I see Chiyoko's face, I feel determined.

318
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,960
That's why I can't get over it.

319
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:13,600
I'm just thinking that form is crazy because it can't be moved.

320
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,880
I know you are reliable.

321
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,220
Wow, this is nice.

322
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,380
He is great.

323
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,040
Hey, he is cute, isn't he?

324
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,140
Yeah, he is.

325
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,940
Thanks.

326
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,360
Next Episode

327
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,900
those girls are out of their minds!

328
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,180
Danco Shishu!

329
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,520
We're gonna win!

330
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,040
Yeah!

331
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Once we talk, we will.

332
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,100
If you talk.

333
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,300
Let's go!

334
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,020
Formation X!

335
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,800
Watch out, Grandpa!

336
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,060
Alright,

337
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,500
just like imposters,

338
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,620
let's do this!

339
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Oh Старый,

340
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,020
you guys really again up here,

341
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,260
If Senpai doesn't come, I'm afraid I'll be out of my mind.

342
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,040
That's why I'm so desperate.

343
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,700
What? You can't come?

344
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,580
No, Senpai.

345
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,620
I'm going.

346
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm going, so you guys have to hold on a little longer.

347
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,140
Go, Kankichi.

348
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,580
Huh?

349
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,040
You have an important job to protect the citizens.

350
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,420
You can't let me waste my time instead of chasing you.

351
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
Is he that dangerous?

352
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,820
That Sendaki Matsu needs help.

353
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,960
He's a big deal.

354
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,740
Huh?

355
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll leave Chiyoko to you.

356
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,180
Come back soon, Kankichi.

357
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,480
Senpai!

358
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,020
Senpai, please come back soon!

359
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,860
Damn it!

360
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,200
What are you going to do?

361
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm sorry I'm late.

362
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,180
I got involved in a fight with my husband.

363
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,280
Huh?

364
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,420
Chiyoko?

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,520
You!

366
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,660
What are you doing with your blood?

367
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,240
Where did you go?

368
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,640
Wait, man!

369
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,860
What are you going to do with your mother?

370
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,140
Are you going to leave her alone?

371
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,440
Yone...

372
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,660
You're going to leave her alone and go after her?

373
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,760
Yone should understand.

374
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,300
I know.

375
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,540
I have to go.

376
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,400
She's been taking care of me for years.

377
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,120
She'll laugh at my last selfishness.

378
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
Don't joke!

379
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,320
I won't forgive her even if my mother forgives me.

380
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,560
If she leaves me alone, I'll never forgive myself.

381
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Chiyoko, take care of your parents.

382
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,300
Dad, the locker is open.

383
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,000
What?

384
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,400
Kankichi!

385
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,700
That's the right side.

386
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,740
You're a good-for-nothing.

387
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,820
You can't replace me.

388
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,380
I can't replace you.

389
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,640
Dad, you're worried about Chiyoko.

390
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,740
What?

391
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,860
What is it?

392
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,640
You're waiting for me, aren't you?

393
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,940
You have your own fight, don't you?

394
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,440
Kankichi!

395
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,180
What?

396
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,640
Senpai!

397
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,140
Ryotsu!

398
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,860
SOS!

399
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,520
What?

400
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,360
Ah!

401
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,020
What's wrong?

402
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,700
What's wrong?

403
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,220
What's wrong?

404
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,340
What's wrong?

405
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,800
What's wrong?

406
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,300
What's wrong?

407
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,060
I'm sorry, Honda.

408
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,420
Forgive me, Bulbosakonji.

409
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,240
This is the only parent high school that one can become.

410
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,780
Let's go clean up, Dad.

411
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,040
Kankichi...

412
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,800
Kankichi

413
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,320
Good luck!

414
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,700
After all it was a deal.

415
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,020
Huh? Ueno's forest is a man's grave.

416
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Ueno? Sakura? Is this Ueno Park?

417
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,080
Yeah.

418
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,380
What a nuisance!

419
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,140
I thought I could drink under that cherry tree for the first time in a long time.

420
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,540
You're pathetic.

421
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,040
Masan!

422
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,000
Oh, Ginji. So you came.

423
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,240
I'll return your old gratitude.

424
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,580
Who's your opponent?

425
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,120
Who is it?

426
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,080
This person is Sendagi no Matsu.

427
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,260
Senpai, you came after all.

428
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,940
Honda, tell them it's a foul to scratch with your nails.

429
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,500
I can't get it with the tactics of the Kisei.

430
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,060
You guys did a good job.

431
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,420
It can't be helped.

432
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,040
Sendagi no Matsu's enemy,

433
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,280
that is, our...

434
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,780
enemy!

435
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,340
You're so persistent.

436
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,400
Why don't you give up?

437
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,820
A dangerous story about the source of life being involved in the story of the flower viewing.

438
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,160
Well, it was good that we both sacrificed our lives.

439
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,160
Masu.

440
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,240
This is Kankichi of Segaru.

441
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,640
This is the first child of this child.

442
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,420
Please take good care of him.

443
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,680
Oh, is that so?

444
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,100
Don't mess with me!

445
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,460
Hey, Chiyoko, you were surprised.

446
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,300
Look at this!

447
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,020
Baby?

448
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,000
Really?

449
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,780
Cute. Whose baby?

450
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,160
Is it...

451
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,460
No, it's my brother Kinjiro's baby.

452
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,580
That's right. It's cute.

453
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,060
What does it mean?

454
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,980
May I hug you?

455
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,500
Yeah.

456
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,960
Okay.

457
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,520
Hmm.

458
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,020
Hmm.

459
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,560
There's no helping it.

460
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,780
I'll let you see the flowers together here with Chiyoko-chan.

461
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,600
Oh!

462
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,260
Yes!

463
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,520
Cheers!

464
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,840
Cheers!

465
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,940
Oh!

466
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,940
Oh!

467
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,560
Oh!

468
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,160
What a good thing.

469
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,840
I was hugged by a pretty sister.

470
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,520
Oh!

471
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,080
It's an old grandpa's tatami shop.

472
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,480
Oh yeah.

473
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,380
If you leave it to me, I'll replace the tatami mats of the White House with new ones every day!

474
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,420
Really?

475
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
As long as there are tatami mats in the White House!

476
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,820
Well, if there's a day like this...

477
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,880
You!

478
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,580
Ah, that's good.

479
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,540
Chiyoko is safe.

480
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,300
You're worried, aren't you?

481
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,160
If we go back, there's no one else here.

482
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
I got a call from the office and I put it on Senpai's phone, but it didn't connect.

483
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,440
I thought I might be able to get her here.

484
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,580
Hmm...

485
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,920
Geez, you're so bored of taking Chinomigo around, aren't you?

486
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,200
Mm, geez!

487
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,280
What's wrong?

488
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
I wanted to show Chiyoko the first cherry blossoms I'd ever seen!

489
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,140
No, I shouldn't have.

490
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,120
Hey, do you want me to give you a ride?

491
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
Oh, well...

492
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,940
I'm sorry.

493
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,960
Mmm...

494
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,920
You won't see Chiyoko around for a moment.

495
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,780
Chiyoko, I'm sorry.

496
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:35,880
Also...

497
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,260
It's okay.

498
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,420
It's fine.

499
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,480
Don't worry about it.

500
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,620
Don't worry about it.

501
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
I'll take you to Senpai's home town again.

502
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,000
No, don't go there, Senpai!

503
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,720
Senpai!

504
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:40,860
Senpai!

505
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,380
I walked

506
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,180
Everyone was a child once

507
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,020
But everyone forgets

508
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,300
A politician with a proud face

509
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,720
A blue aunt above your eyes

510
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,620
Turn around and see

511
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,940
That corner

512
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,180
Everyone, everyone

513
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,660
I can meet everyone

514
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,600
Let's go!

515
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,940
There is a wall

516
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,400
There must be a wall

517
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,380
Everyone, come to our town

518
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,480
Thank you!

519
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,620
Why did I draw this?

520
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,920
Moreover, the president has been announced only today

521
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,620
I'm sitting in the studio

522
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,420
The inside is non-cooperative

523
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,860
The temple is inactive

524
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,920
I have to erase the graffiti quickly

525
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,040
It will be a big deal

526
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,660
Next time, erase the graffiti

527
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,120
Thank you

528
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,380
There is a wall

529
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,900
There must be a wall

530
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,800
Everyone, come to our town

531
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
