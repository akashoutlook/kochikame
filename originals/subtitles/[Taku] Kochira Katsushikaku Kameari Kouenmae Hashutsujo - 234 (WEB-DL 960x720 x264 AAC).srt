1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
Book of L vierte

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,960
When you watch TV, turn on your light to make the room bright, so that you can see and look far away.

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,220
Come to me, poor fellow!

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,500
Come to me!

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not here, but I'm worried

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,760
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,900
White clouds

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,800
I wonder what will happen

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,520
I know!

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm not here, but I'm worried

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,100
Look at the red clouds

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,540
I'm not here, but I'm worried

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,160
I wonder what will happen

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,040
I know!

15
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm not here, but I'm worried

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,680
I know!

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,840
If you know, just come to me!

18
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,980
Shrimp, crab, squid, the arrival of a huge biophysicist!

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,020
What is this?

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,960
What's wrong, Senpai?

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,420
There's a lot of things to do!

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,720
Look at this!

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,420
Shrimp Tempura

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,000
Shrimp Tempura

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,060
is the shrimp tempura

26
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,960
of a front-age ahead of the station?

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,700
See?

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Shrimp Tempura

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,180
Shrimp Tempura

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,320
Shrimp Tempura

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,660
Shrimp Tempura

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,180
Shrimp Tempura

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,420
Shrimp Tempura

34
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,120
What? What do you mean?

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,960
What's wrong, Mr. Terai?

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,020
I just got a call about an accident.

37
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,820
What kind of accident?

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,540
A car slipped on banana leaves.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,420
A car slipped on banana leaves?

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not like the old manga.

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,200
I can't believe it.

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,920
It's time to get to the scene.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,160
It's time to get to the scene.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
It's definitely a real banana leaf.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,180
It's a little too big.

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,120
Why is this in the middle of the road?

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,980
Oh, did it fall here?

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
It's talking to you.

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,620
Banana's funny.

50
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,960
I remember hearing that voice.

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,160
Long time no see, Gorilla-kun.

52
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,300
Professor Ezaki.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,160
So it's you.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,000
Ezaki Bio Lab?

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,960
When did you build such a suspicious building?

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,500
Did you make the giant banana here?

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah.

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,440
I was going to throw it away with trash, but it didn't fit in the trash bag.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,340
I was going to take it to the garbage disposal site, but it fell off the car on the way.

60
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,380
He's a noisy guy.

61
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,340
Oh, this is amazing.

62
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
It's all dozens of times the size.

63
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,860
It's going crazy.

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,500
It looks like a multi-colored giant banana.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,700
All right, let's try how hard we can do it.

66
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,120
I was able to do it with my whole body, so it's very beautiful.

67
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,780
Does this mean I can actually turn the earth upside down without any problems?

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,600
Isn't that what the Beastman said?

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,960
To be blessed with the victory award, too.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,980
Did you really make a student this year?

71
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,900
You are going to be on top of the euphoria.

72
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,340
I don't think so.

73
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,360
Maybe.

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,800
You're the one who's worried about "maybe"!

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
Nakagawa, you won't eat?

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,940
Yes, I'll take my leave.

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,660
First, rice.

78
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,740
This is...

79
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,960
Giant Koshihikari 28.

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,320
That's about five bowls of rice in one bowl.

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,800
How about side dishes?

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,460
I'm home.

83
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,440
Natto.

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
Natto?

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,760
Please have some rice.

86
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,180
It's not on the menu at all.

87
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
It's just on the menu.

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,940
Kau soup.

89
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Kaeware daikon.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Eat it and go home.

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,260
How does it taste?

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Not bad, but it's definitely not good.

93
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,700
I see.

94
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,880
Not bad.

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,620
Not bad, but it's definitely not good.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,600
It's not good.

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,080
What are you writing about?

98
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,060
Who wrote this?

99
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,960
It's not good.

100
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,300
It's not good.

101
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
It's...

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,120
He was really doing a human body experiment with his own body.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
What on earth is this?

104
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,920
No, if it's a special body of Gorilla-kun, I wouldn't be shocked.

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,040
You're kidding, right?

106
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,520
Nakagawa, let's go home.

107
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,780
Wait.

108
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,560
There aren't many people like Gorilla-kun who have a special body.

109
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,620
Please go out with me a little more.

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,820
Of course, I can't say it's free.

111
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,900
I'll pay cash for my part-time job.

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,820
Part-time job? Cash?

113
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,500
Actually, I was worried about the food crisis in the future.

114
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,860
It's for the future of mankind.

115
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,920
If I'm fine with it, I'll gladly cooperate.

116
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,820
Oh, you'll do it for me?

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,620
Haa...

118
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,280
The seeds are big and hard to eat.

119
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,620
The skin is hot and hard to peel.

120
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,540
I don't have enough bitterness.

121
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,540
Am I a caterpillar?

122
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,720
Am I a caterpillar?

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,640
Am I a caterpillar?

124
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,220
As expected, you're full, Senpai.

125
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm sick of vegetables and fruits.

126
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,020
Don't you have meat?

127
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,840
Of course, I have meat.

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,760
Haa...

129
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,120
Here it is.

130
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Hmm?

131
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,300
What is that?

132
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,620
Gorilla-kun!

133
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,780
Huh?

134
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,820
It's here!

135
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,240
It's here!

136
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,100
Huh?

137
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,580
Huh?

138
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,400
It's here!

139
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,780
Huh?

140
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,920
It's here!

141
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a flat-faced gorilla!

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
It's a flat-faced gorilla!

143
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,640
What?

144
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,920
What's wrong with you?

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,480
What is he?

146
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
It's a giant whale, Hyonkichi-kun.

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Pyonkichi?

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,780
It's not "pyon".

149
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,340
It's "hyon".

150
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,000
Hyonkichi!

151
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,240
Does he eat, too?

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
No, he's a pet.

153
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,300
A pet?

154
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,180
Yes.

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,540
My research is not just for food crisis.

156
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,300
What's going on on Earth in 2002?

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,140
Watermelons keep decreasing, greenery is exposed to the atmosphere.

158
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,020
Co2 increases destroy ozone layer.

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,960
Atmospheric line rains.

160
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
Temperature rises.

161
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,000
Because of these factors, the number of frogs is decreasing.

162
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,280
So I'm a strong frog who can't lose to anyone.

163
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
It's just so cool!

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,380
I've come up with the idea of making the King of Frogs!

165
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
So that's what this is.

166
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,360
Stop! Stop!

167
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,840
It seems like Hyonkichi likes it.

168
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,100
What?

169
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,000
He usually catches flies under it, but he doesn't mind.

170
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,460
He likes it!

171
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,880
What's in here?

172
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
What is this?

173
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,980
It's a shirasu.

174
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,880
What?

175
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,280
-What? -This?

176
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,560
If you look closely, it's true.

177
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,040
But I don't think it's a shirasu if it's this big.

178
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,280
It's a clamshell.

179
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,560
It seems like humans come out of it.

180
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,580
It's a sea urchin.

181
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
It's a huge thorn.

182
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,800
It's hard to catch.

183
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,600
What's that?

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,960
It's a lobster!

185
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,420
If you make a tandon with that, you'll get a lot to eat.

186
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,400
It's a lobster!

187
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,040
Okay, let's start with that lobster.

188
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm going to make it a tandon!

189
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,380
All right, got it.

190
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,320
All right!

191
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,980
Here we go!

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
It's a squid!

193
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,340
This is a crab, right?

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,600
It comes out of a crab.

195
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,780
It's a lobster.

196
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,080
Oh, wow.

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,200
It's a crab.

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,400
What's this?

199
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,440
Look, it's a butter shell!

200
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,340
What?

201
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,660
What?

202
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,900
Hey, you two!

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
The three weapons will go out!

204
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,420
If they go out of town, things will get serious!

205
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,640
I won't let you get away! My shrimp-tent!

206
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,200
The three weapons will go out! My shrimp-tent!

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
As I thought, my father's special technique is the best!

208
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,220
It's old-fashioned.

209
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,800
Now that we're in the CG era,

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
we need to make a powerful screen that pops out of the screen.

211
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,060
It's really popping out!

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,280
It's so powerful!

213
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,540
Yes, this is the exit in front of the park.

214
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,280
Huh?

215
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,120
What's that all about?

216
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,560
What's wrong?

217
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,860
It's about giant shrimps, crabs and squids rampaging in the city.

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,620
What?

219
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,580
Isn't that a prank call?

220
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,740
This is bad!

221
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,520
What's wrong, Kei?

222
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,860
A giant bioparticle from Professor Ezaki's place has escaped into town!

223
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,060
A giant bioparticle?

224
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,380
Hurry up, Hyon-kichi!

225
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,820
Don't let my ship escape!

226
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,660
That was a prank call!

227
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,900
It wasn't, was it?

228
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
What a giant shrimp-tent!

229
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,580
You don't see these kind of shrimp-tents very often.

230
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,700
What do you think?

231
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:19,760
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,760
This is a big one!

233
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,460
Two of them in no time.

234
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,380
What's going on?

235
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,860
A giant creature seems to have escaped near Shimabata.

236
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,120
It seems like it's not escaping near Shimabata.

237
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,900
Such a big one?

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,940
Where did it hide?

239
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,620
Hmm?

240
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,900
The giant creatures are going towards Asakusa at a very high speed.

241
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,740
This?

242
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,200
I thought it would be like this, so I turned on the transmitter for the creatures.

243
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,440
I see.

244
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,800
Hurry up and say such things!

245
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,100
Senpai!

246
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,260
We're in Asakusa!

247
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,700
The giant creatures are heading towards Asakusa!

248
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,580
Asakusa!

249
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,960
Asakusa!

250
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,420
Next is Asakusa, Asakusa...

251
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,620
Hyon-Kichi, hurry up!

252
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,780
It's a Tendon! Tendon!

253
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,940
Incredible!

254
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
As expected of Japan's Godzilla country!

255
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:35,900
It's a Tendon!

256
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,800
Everyone, look!

257
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,760
One of Japan's most famous tourist attractions

258
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,700
is about to be destroyed by a mysterious giant creature!

259
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,100
The giant creature destroyed Kaminarimon

260
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,680
and is currently on its way to the war zone on Nakamise Street!

261
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,220
What's that?

262
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,220
Damn it!

263
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,980
You're just doing whatever you want!

264
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,840
Let's go!

265
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,400
You're just doing whatever you want!

266
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,020
Let's go, Hyon-Kichi!

267
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm going to Tendon!

268
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,940
It was a giant frog that challenged three giant creatures,

269
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,740
but it's still a Tendon!

270
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,180
It's not moving, and it's not moving at all!

271
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not moving, and it's not moving at all!

272
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:57,660
It's heavy...

273
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,620
Now, I'm going to fly to Kappa Bridge...

274
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,580
What's that?

275
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,240
The Ultra Tendon Big Operation?

276
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:07,580
The Ultra Tendon Big Operation?

277
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,300
That's right.

278
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,180
Listen, here's the plan.

279
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,060
What's that?

280
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,580
What's that?

281
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,300
What's that?

282
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,680
This waterfall will be a passageway!

283
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,900
A giant hot pot was set up at the Koma-Gatabashi intersection by the police!

284
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
What's going to happen next?

285
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,740
The amount of oil is OK!

286
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,940
All right!

287
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,160
OK, start!

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,540
He's heating up the oil he poured into a huge hot pot!

289
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,840
Will he do a tempura?

290
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,220
It looks ready.

291
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,120
Let's go, Hyon-Kichi!

292
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,260
The giant creature is in the middle of an international corridor...

293
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
It's in the middle of an international corridor!

294
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,920
I have to find a way out.

295
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,180
Hey, it's time for you to eat!

296
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,700
A huge creature has been sent out from the International Street to Asakusa Street by a giant frog!

297
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,660
Come on, come on!

298
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,900
It's time for you to eat!

299
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,060
Come on, come on!

300
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,620
If you're going to eat, you better get the batter!

301
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,880
The three frogs are being led towards the Komagatabashi Bridge,

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,960
and the other is going to the Kikura Bridge!

303
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,020
We did it!

304
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,200
The giant creatures are like tempura balls, and they're all in the color of foxes!

305
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,040
The crisis of Tokyo has disappeared!

306
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't think that's the last one.

307
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,080
As long as we forget our co-existence with nature,

308
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,920
and keep destroying the Earth,

309
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,580
there will be a third and final incident.

310
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,860
That's not the last one.

311
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
You have a lot of them, don't you?

312
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,720
Now, all we have to do is cook the rice and turn it into tempura balls.

313
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,920
I'll feed you some, too, Hyonkichi.

314
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,740
What's wrong, Hyonkichi?

315
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Are you tired?

316
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,560
Aren't you sleepy?

317
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,380
Frogs usually sleep in at this time.

318
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,760
I see.

319
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,800
When you wake up from your sleep,

320
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,160
I'll feed you with all the food you want.

321
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,040
Go to sleep.

322
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,160
Amazing!

323
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,340
Then, let's go!

324
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,900
Let's go!

325
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,140
Let's eat!

326
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,920
It's delicious!

327
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,620
I've never had such delicious tempura balls before!

328
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,760
It's full of meat!

329
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,860
It's a long-standing research treasure.

330
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,020
By the way, what about Ryo?

331
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,100
He wanted to eat it the most.

332
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,060
Hey!

333
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,400
Let go of me!

334
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,140
Why can't I be a commoner with you?

335
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,540
Let go of me!

336
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,120
Why can't I be a commoner with you?

337
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,120
If you are a commoner,

338
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,940
And let go of me!

339
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,660
You want to eat me?

340
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,200
Why don't you just let me go?

341
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,360
Hey, you are a commoner!

342
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Let go of me!

343
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,100
No, I'm not a commoner.

344
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,740
I want to sleep with you.

345
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,280
Let go of me!

346
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,460
Why not?

347
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
I don't want to sleep with you.

348
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,040
Let go of me!

349
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm young, develop mental health.

350
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,940
Don't you know your mission to kill yourself?

351
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,160
Well then, let's go upstairs.

352
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,860
It's time for a good rest!

353
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,580
Why didn't we sleep well last night?

354
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,300
Yeah, you have a bad sleeping habit.

355
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,440
I'm listening.

356
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,540
Good.

357
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,980
What is this?

358
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,440
Please have a seat.

359
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,960
But it's perfectly unified in red.

360
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
If you like, please.

361
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,240
It's strawberry and cherry tomato ketchup and tomato juice.

362
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,180
I used to work at the post office until last month.

363
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,380
I've been a fireman since this month.

364
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,220
Your eyes look bloodshot.

365
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,740
I have a lot of night shifts from work.

366
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,300
But it's a worthwhile job surrounded by red.

367
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,280
The number 602 is insulting that beautiful red.

368
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,340
Well, everyone has their favorite color.

369
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,000
What are you talking about?

370
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,500
What is your blood color?

371
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,920
Red, right?

372
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
Red is the source of human life.

373
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
Shall I show you?

374
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,980
I got it.

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,920
Red is wonderful.

376
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,240
I'll persuade you.

377
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,440
Then I'll ask you to do it.

378
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,300
I got it.

379
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,680
He's a great man with a lot of policies.

380
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,500
So I'm in trouble.

381
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,040
Mr. Midorikawa.

382
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,480
Mr. Omari wants to talk to you.

383
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,080
Really?

384
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,820
Please.

385
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,020
It's like a jungle.

386
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,700
What are you doing?

387
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,840
I'm a nature protector.

388
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,920
You know that green is the best for human eyes.

389
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,460
Green is important to humans, not just eyes.

390
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,940
But...

391
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,000
Red is bad for your eyes.

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,740
It's a poisonous color that turns red when it's mixed with the species.

393
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,400
Green is a must-have color to change people's nature.

394
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,320
I understand.

395
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,180
Let's talk slowly while eating salad next time.

396
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay. See you.

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,160
Next is Mr. Kimoto of 607.

398
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,460
It's open.

399
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,180
Here you go.

400
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,280
What's this?

401
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,360
What's this?

402
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,540
I have eyes on the gap that overlaps.

403
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,320
Are you okay?

404
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,240
Okay, I'm fine now.

405
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,020
Listen, Mr. Omari.

406
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,640
It's a nuisance for the residents of this neighborhood.

407
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,260
You're an idiot to want to paint your house in a bad color.

408
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,580
But it's all yellow here, too.

409
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,760
Happy colors are on the fortune-telling.

410
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,860
Sorry.

411
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,300
You're really weird.

412
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,580
Next is the doctor.

413
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,000
This time it's fine.

414
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,440
Mr. Shiroyama, are you here?

415
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,220
I've been waiting for you.

416
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,900
I'm the most calm when it comes to work.

417
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,980
Well, how about milk?

418
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,660
If you make a mistake, you'll be taken out of the room.

419
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,840
Modern people are all affected by color.

420
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm the best at getting rid of them.

421
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,060
The confrontation here is amazing.

422
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,120
That's why there are so many fights.

423
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,380
Mr. Kimi, do you happen to be the boss?

424
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,500
Maybe.

425
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,100
Kimi, would you like to go out with me for a walk?

426
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Just a little walk.

427
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,740
What is that old guy in gold?

428
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,920
Mr. Kimi in room 610.

429
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,500
He never fights.

430
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,040
He's really myhem behaving without any fight.

431
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Or he might be taken out in a while.

432
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,480
Here you are.

433
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,520
The last one is Mr. Kurohara, anamosomatologist.

434
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Just in case I thought you're a doctor, you're an amamosomist.

435
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,920
Sorry.

436
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,140
Sorry.

437
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,880
It's pitch black.

438
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,760
Hey, Box, where are you?

439
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,460
Here.

440
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,460
Don't be surprised. Turn on the light.

441
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,900
I'm on it.

442
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,200
The room is all black and it's hard to tell.

443
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,000
Go outside for a bit.

444
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,440
See?

445
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,200
You even have your shoes on your face and your face is all gray.

446
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,480
Black is a sacred color.

447
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,140
See? All of your clothes are black.

448
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,640
It's black, right?

449
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,960
You can't tell if you put coffee in a black cup, right?

450
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,820
What about milk and sugar?

451
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,800
I don't have milk, but I have sugar.

452
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,620
Here, black sugar.

453
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,300
I thought so.

454
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,420
Huh? What's that sound?

455
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,380
It's a pet.

456
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,200
A black cat.

457
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,880
Where's the exit?

458
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,160
Hey, Box, don't close your eyes.

459
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,980
You can't tell where he is, can you?

460
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
This place is a mess.

461
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I told you so.

462
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,420
I told you to do something.

463
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,680
What?

464
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,940
It started again.

465
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,920
You don't have any sense of discipline, do you?

466
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,820
Shut up! You too!

467
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,740
What?

468
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,380
I'm going crazy.

469
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,200
I don't care.

470
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,300
We're all the same.

471
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,960
It's because of the poor heart that you're poor.

472
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,660
I'll pay you, so let's make up.

473
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,580
What?

474
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,860
I'm going crazy.

475
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm going crazy when I'm angry.

476
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,480
I'll go crazy when I'm angry.

477
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,200
I'll go crazy when I'm angry.

478
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,500
Damn it!

479
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,580
I'm gonna make you all the same!

480
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,260
That's why you can't add more green!

481
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,420
Stop!

482
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:52,940
Stop!

483
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,300
I'm not going to do it again!

484
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,500
Stop!

485
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm not going to do it again!

486
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,900
Stop!

487
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,360
Stop!

488
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,260
The color's gone.

489
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,180
My gold eyes!

490
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,060
It became black and white.

491
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,680
Look.

492
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,300
Because you're so particular about colors,

493
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
the gods got angry

494
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,440
and made it into a black and white anime.

495
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,280
What?

496
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,380
No way!

497
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,660
We're going to...

498
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,420
What should we do?

499
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,520
What?

500
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,120
Don't worry.

501
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,220
When we were kids,

502
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,820
the TV was all white.

503
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,700
But everyone was happy to watch it.

504
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,280
But what about the recent TV?

505
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,260
Color, stereo, digital, high-vision.

506
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,700
Even if technology advances,

507
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,120
it won't be good.

508
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,300
Even if we don't add colors,

509
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,860
as long as the content is interesting,

510
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,680
it's okay.

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,780
That's right.

512
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,820
It's okay even if there's no color.

513
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,160
We were wrong.

514
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,020
That's right.

515
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,460
We did it.

516
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,240
What?

517
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,900
Let's show our thanks to the gods.

518
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,300
Even when black and white,

519
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,060
you never change.

520
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,680
Sir,

521
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,700
it's sorry to have our bad temper.

522
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,460
Did you understand, you folks?

523
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,820
Here, have a look!

524
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,220
That beautiful rainbow

525
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,520
that goes with a Happy End!

526
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,260
Hmm,

527
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,320
but you can't catch a single thing.

528
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,040
That's not a black and white anime.

529
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,280
Color isn't good enough.

531
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,960
I'm a little liar and cheat

532
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,540
But sometimes I'm helping someone

533
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,460
Baby do you know me?

534
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,360
I'm heading to tomorrow

535
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,680
Nice breathing

536
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,480
Don't be sick, I'll do what I do

537
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,500
Cute breathing

538
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,880
It's hard to understand

539
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,980
But I want to show you

540
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,560
It's better than looking down on yourself

541
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:23,820
Oh no!

542
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,720
I lost the wedding ring of the chief who was asked to repair it!

543
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,860
I must have lost the wedding ring of the chief who was asked to repair it!

544
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,640
Why?!

545
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,800
Did you sell 200 rings on bazaar?

546
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,020
I guess I can't help but get it right

547
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,800
See you next time on Find the Insect!

548
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,960
See you next time on Find the Insect!

549
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,420
There is a turtle

550
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,760
A turtle is just like a turtle

551
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
A turtle is just like a turtle

552
