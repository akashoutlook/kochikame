1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:00,900
Wanderer"

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,440
"The Wanderer"

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,200
When you watch TV,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,840
make your room bright and look away.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,660
"The Wanderer"

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,880
"The Wanderer"

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,100
"The Wanderer"

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,340
"The Wanderer"

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,560
Come to me,

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,280
the poor guy.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm not here,

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,120
but I'm worried.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
Look at the blue sky,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
and the white clouds.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,680
I'll be able to do something

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,920
in the meantime.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,320
"The Wanderer"

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,420
"The Wanderer"

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,360
"The Wanderer"

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:50,700
"The Wanderer"

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,340
"The Wanderer"

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,220
"The Wanderer"

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,880
"The Wanderer"

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,400
"The Wanderer"

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:55,920
"The Wanderer"

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,900
I'm not busy,

27
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,240
and I'm worried.

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,380
There is no single wasted time.

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,980
"The Wanderer"

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,680
"The Wanderer"

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,680
"The Wanderer"

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,840
"The Wanderer"

33
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,440
"The Wanderer"

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,360
"The Wanderer"

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,240
"The Wanderer"

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,820
Come on, follow me!

37
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,400
Meditation! This is the temporary exit!

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,760
Alright!

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,020
Oh, good morning!

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,360
Good morning, Ryo-chan!

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,720
Ryo-san, wait a moment!

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,200
I'll clean up now!

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,380
Senpai!

44
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,980
Don't use my desk without permission!

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,620
I'm sorry...

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,280
Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

47
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,800
That's right!

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,860
Don't you feel sorry for Terai-san?

49
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,800
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,280
I feel sorry for him too!

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,280
He changed his mind and was aiming for the real thing!

52
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,020
But he got away with it and he's running away!

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,420
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

54
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,740
Oh no! The chair is bent!

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Oh, I broke the ornament.

56
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,940
Don't worry about me!

57
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,800
Ryo-chan is self-sufficient!

58
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,920
I can't use this chair anymore.

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,500
Give it to me!

60
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,500
This is how you do it!

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
This is how you fix it!

62
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,280
Oh, then I can't sit.

63
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,340
You're going to the art museum.

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm getting a tip from my salary next month.

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,600
Shut up!

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,340
You can't sit like this!

67
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,300
See? It's comfortable to sit.

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,740
It's not bad...

69
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,620
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

70
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,120
Ouch! Ouch!

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,940
Gagu!

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
This time, the bookshelf...

73
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Oh, no!

74
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,620
Why is there a bookshelf in such a place?

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,420
Ouch!

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,620
Gagu!

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,820
What are you going to do with this, Ryo-chan?

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,300
If I do this...

79
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,420
Ouch!

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,120
Ouch!

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,340
Oh!

82
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,240
This wall is also hard!

83
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh, stop it!

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm going to support you with this!

85
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,660
The window is broken!

86
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,500
There are holes in the roof!

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,180
Oh, it's a mouse!

88
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,120
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

89
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,260
Ryo-chan, I'm going to do it!

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,440
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

91
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,960
Get out of here!

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,180
Oh!

93
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,380
Ouch!

94
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,820
Ouch!

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,300
Ouch!

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,760
Ouch!

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,820
What's going on?

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,240
What?

99
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,460
How could it be?

100
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,540
Huh?

101
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,860
Wow!

102
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
Our leader!

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,240
What are you guys...

104
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,040
Ah, our leader!

105
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,920
That's...

106
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,760
What is it?

107
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

108
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,360
Who the hell is doing this?

109
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,600
Huh?

110
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,280
You again, Ryotsu?

111
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,660
You call this a "mess"?

112
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,820
This is just the way it is.

113
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,980
Idiot!

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,180
For some reason, at such an important time...

115
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,500
Important time?

116
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,720
The Headquarters will be here tomorrow morning.

117
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,100
The Headquarters?

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,960
The Headquarters?

119
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,440
The Headquarters's actual investigation, you idiot!

120
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,720
If you tell the Headquarters about this, they'll know.

121
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,200
Don't make that face, Butchon.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
It's impossible to change the date of the Headquarters's investigation.

123
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,580
I've become weak.

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,660
Leave it to me, Butchon.

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,660
By the end of the day, I'll make sure to make sure the Headquarters is as it was.

126
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,160
You think so?

127
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,440
Of course, Butchon.

128
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,260
Anyway, everyone gather here at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

129
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,560
Until then, continue your usual work.

130
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,960
Ryotsu, your punishment will be decided at that time.

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,980
Wash your head and wait.

132
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,040
But, there's no Headquarters. How can I work here?

133
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,060
Yeah.

134
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,640
Even the idiot there can think about that!

135
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,260
Chief!

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,260
The Headquarters will be repaired as it was!

137
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll work here too!

138
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,380
I'll make sure to get through this hard time!

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,640
Chief!

140
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,140
I can't do this.

141
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,500
The day after tomorrow means the day after tomorrow.

142
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,060
I don't have time!

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,520
What's with that cold look?

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,180
Everyone has it, doesn't he?

145
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,660
You're so angry that you're going to break the bridge!

146
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,500
No.

147
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,060
Well, I guess you don't do it that often.

148
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,780
Anyway, it's a crisis.

149
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,580
I'm sorry for raising the force of the Nagagawa Group.

150
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,780
I'm going to make a big surprise appearance!

151
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,440
Don't let us down this time.

152
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,940
What?

153
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,360
We decided to take this opportunity to think about whether it's okay to follow Senpai or not.

154
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,380
Don't be so mean, Reiko-chan.

155
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,060
I'll take a look at Ryo-chan's work.

156
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,660
I've been with you for a long time.

157
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,700
Please persuade the two of you.

158
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
I have a family I have to protect.

159
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,660
I have a family I have to protect.

160
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,320
Is that so?

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,360
Do it yourself!

162
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm not asking you anymore!

163
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,420
We're going back to the office.

164
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,780
Please contact us once the policy is decided.

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Chief Ryo-chan.

166
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,200
Oh.

167
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,180
Isn't this my wallet?

168
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Hmm.

169
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,400
Hmm.

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
We can't let this go to the original until the day after tomorrow.

171
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,000
We can't, Ryo-san.

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,160
That's it!

173
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,360
For now, if it's a look for the original,

174
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,620
papercraft or writing, or whatever,

175
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,340
I'm counting on you.

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,860
It can't be that kind of thing.

177
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,700
If you do this,

178
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,420
I'll ask you to do the renovation of my dad's store.

179
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,660
Come to think of it,

180
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,700
No, I heard that we should change the building into a new one.

181
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,580
Oh, really, Ryo-san?

182
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,600
My old man in Tsukuda-jima got tired of living in a new house,

183
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,700
so he wanted to build a house on the ground again.

184
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,180
He said that, but he didn't say anything.

185
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,380
Oh, let me do that!

186
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,580
Then...

187
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,580
I'll do my best.

188
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,700
Really?

189
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,380
If I can't get through, the street will be blocked.

190
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,700
Now I have to find a room for the temporary house.

191
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,460
Is it true that he found a property for the temporary house?

192
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,160
It's about Ryo-chan, so it's definitely a bad place.

193
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,000
I thought Ryo-san was going to this area...

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Hey, this way!

195
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,520
Here!

196
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,380
Go up the elevator!

197
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,680
Okay!

198
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,300
What?

199
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,380
Wow! It's so big and beautiful!

200
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,240
What's wrong with this place?

201
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,480
My skills are just like this.

202
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, relax without hesitation.

203
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,480
It's strange that the temporary house is better.

204
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,300
Ryo-chan, did you do something bad?

205
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,140
I can hear everything!

206
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,020
What?

207
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,120
Ahahaha!

208
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,060
It's such a temporary house.

209
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,820
I thought there must be an property that the real estate company is not even renting.

210
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,500
We rented it for 3000 yen a day.

211
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,900
It's a condition to clean up through the wind.

212
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,040
It's cheap in this room.

213
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,620
As expected, Senpai.

214
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,140
K-chan, if you praise it, it will be on the map again.

215
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,220
It's amazing!

216
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,240
There is a washing machine in the bathroom!

217
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,720
The mirror of the washroom is also large.

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,740
There are also things that make a big wind.

219
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,280
It's like a department store!

220
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,220
Compared to the department store, it seems to be a temple for the common people.

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

222
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh, Chief Ohara!

223
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,000
Chief, how is my temporary house?

224
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,580
Please relax slowly.

225
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,120
There is also a sofa with a leather handle.

226
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,660
I can't do that, but...

227
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm not worried about you, Chief!

228
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,900
Chief, the repair work of the washroom in front of the park has been done perfectly, so please rest assured.

229
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,020
Oh, I see.

230
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,960
The repair work of the washroom in front of the park is complete.

231
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm a man who does it when I do it.

232
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,200
There should be a washroom around here.

233
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Oh?

234
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,680
An announcement that there is a washroom.

235
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,740
Phew, what do you think?

236
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,380
Reiko, can I borrow an tout?

237
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
I've got to go to the other side, I'm in pain!

238
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,220
Hayato, there looks to be a problem with the motel service They have at night.

239
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,180
Elder, did you bring all the mulberry?

240
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,720
Was that all, Captain?

241
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,420
Yo-san!

242
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,840
Wasn't the old lady's poem "Shigin no Kai" this weekend?

243
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,740
Keiko!

244
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,960
Did you call me?

245
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,600
It's the last letter of the book!

246
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,340
What?

247
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,720
I said, the last letter!

248
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,360
What?

249
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,620
No, I can't hold it in!

250
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,340
It seems like they haven't had a chance to talk since just now.

251
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,760
I can't calm down when I have more than 60% of the time.

252
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,120
I can't calm down when I have more than 60% of the time.

253
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,580
You're right, the work efficiency is getting worse.

254
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,740
Don't be so luxurious!

255
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,080
Forgive me!

256
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
Why is the exit on top of the building?

257
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
I just wanted to ask the directions!

258
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,780
Did you climb up the stairs?

259
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,520
Check!

260
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,240
The elevator is stopped by regular inspection!

261
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,120
Senpai, this place is really...

262
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,600
It's not suitable for the exit, Ryo-san.

263
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Let's move, Ryo-chan.

264
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't say it so easily!

265
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,740
Don't say it so easily!

266
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't say it so easily!

267
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,700
It's been three days since we've found this house...

268
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,420
It's been three days since we've found this house...

269
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,700
It's been three days since we've found this house...

270
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:57,860
It's been three days since we've found this house...

271
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:05,140
It's this place!

272
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,220
What did you say?!

273
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,620
Damn it!

274
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm not sure if this is the right place to continue, though.

275
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,300
The ratio is close to the original station.

276
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,580
The most important thing is that you only have to pay for the high fever.

277
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,860
It's a super good property.

278
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,700
But senpai.

279
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,660
Ryo-san.

280
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,140
Because, Ryo-chan, this is not a pub.

281
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,220
It's a station size in terms of size.

282
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,940
Certainly the red carpet on the front looks like a stone light.

283
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,500
Kei-chan, you're putting it on your pace.

284
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
Yes, yes, yes.

285
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,340
"It's a station size in terms of size"

286
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
How about it?

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,740
It looks like a station, right?

288
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,040
If you do that, you'll get in the way of the business, Ryo-san.

289
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,920
Do you have permission?

290
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,800
Huh? Ryo-san?

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,780
Yo. You're still as energetic as ever.

292
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,220
Oh, Ryo-san.

293
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,460
We're going out soon.

294
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,380
Yeah.

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,540
It's a summer vacation.

296
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,260
Okay.

297
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,720
That's what I'm saying.

298
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,340
Oh.

299
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,760
If you're going to give us a vacation,

300
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,820
there's nothing more reassuring than this.

301
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,320
Well then, I'm counting on you.

302
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,960
Ryo-san.

303
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,860
Bye-bye.

304
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,840
Have a good trip.

305
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,940
Take care of your souvenirs.

306
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,420
If that's what you want,

307
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,520
I'll let you use it.

308
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,540
Eh? Kei-chan.

309
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,660
It's until the day after tomorrow.

310
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,580
Until the day after tomorrow.

311
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,260
Since long ago,

312
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,600
I've been called Miyako.

313
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Eh?

314
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,340
Say cheese, please.

315
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh, that's not fair.

316
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,340
Here's a beer.

317
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,300
Here's some more.

318
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,020
Shrimp shumai,

319
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,500
I'll be taken away with you,

320
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,000
Pfft.

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,880
Bring me the beer.

322
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,600
I can't give you the beer.

323
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,160
lt's a beer!

324
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,500
It's a good place to go to the toilet.

325
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm sorry, but please go to the store.

326
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,620
Whatever you want, I'll have beer.

327
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Bring me beer.

328
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,880
I can't bring you beer.

329
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,020
Beer, beer, beer.

330
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,840
Senpai, it's impossible to go to the toilet here.

331
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,200
That's why I told you.

332
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,940
This is bad.

333
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,180
If you don't remove the red carpet on the front, the customers will come in more and more.

334
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,800
Yeah.

335
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,880
Yeah.

336
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah.

337
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,320
Yeah.

338
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,040
Yeah.

339
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,560
Yeah.

340
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,860
It looks delicious.

341
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,640
Ten bottles of beer for the time being.

342
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,120
We are at a tea party.

343
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,260
Well, ten bottles of beer.

344
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,400
I'll take four.

345
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,220
Me too.

346
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,860
Me too.

347
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,720
Umesawa is here.

348
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,560
Yeah.

349
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,340
What shall i do, Ryo?

350
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Damn.

351
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,320
Yeah.

352
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,080
Yeah.

353
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
*Sigh*

354
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
*Sigh*

355
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,800
*Sigh*

356
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
The power went out again!

357
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,520
The power went out again!

358
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:32,480
The power went out again!

359
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,440
*Sigh*

360
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,420
I don't know what's going on.

361
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,480
I don't know what's going on.

362
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,240
This is the application problem of the formula that I taught you earlier.

363
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,580
This is the application problem of the formula that I taught you earlier.

364
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,140
This is the application problem of the formula that I taught you earlier.

365
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,780
Oh, I see.

366
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,920
Let's make it a solution!

367
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,880
What?

368
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,860
You stole everything!

369
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,960
You said you don't know.

370
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,760
You said you don't know.

371
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,580
I can't run away anymore.

372
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,640
I think it's better to give up honestly.

373
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,120
I don't know.

374
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,840
You don't know.

375
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,620
Then why do you have my underwear?

376
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,880
Then why do you have my underwear?

377
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,820
*Sigh*

378
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,600
*Sigh*

379
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,220
Next to math is English.

380
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,280
Next to math is English.

381
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,420
Yes.

382
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,500
You stole it!

383
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,680
Be honest!

384
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,800
You stole it!

385
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,660
You don't know.

386
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,740
You don't know.

387
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,880
You don't know!

388
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,820
You liar! You pervert!

389
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:32,780
You!

390
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,240
You can't concentrate at all with this!

391
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,460
This is not good, I will fail the exam!

392
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,300
This is not good, I will fail the exam!

393
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,360
You are unreasonable to turn the room

394
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,500
You are unreasonable to turn the room

395
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,020
instead of teaching at home, Ryo-chan.

396
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,420
Uhmm...

397
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,220
I thought it was just right

398
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,960
because I didn't have money to go to the prep school

399
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,900
I thought it was just right because I didn't have money to go to the prep school

400
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,340
Hey, stop it!

401
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,820
You're noisy, so the children won't stop crying!

402
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,080
Ugh...

403
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:11,900
KOUMYOU

404
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,320
Pardon me.

405
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:28,340
M.B.M. B.A.B.

406
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,980
That's all it says.

407
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,860
And that's it.

408
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,620
...

409
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,760
The small ways I used to travel through the world,

410
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
now I have to go back again.

411
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,140
Oh, uh, what's up?

412
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,420
N-Nope...

413
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,900
Um, could you help me buy a 1000 yen ticket?

414
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,600
Would you like to pay for it?

415
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry, but this is an exit, so I don't want to pay for it.

416
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,920
I see.

417
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:07,800
Good.

418
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,900
Wait a minute!

419
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,100
Give me all the coins you have!

420
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,660
I pay with cards.

421
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
I don't carry coins.

422
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,060
How much is it?

423
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,880
It's 238 yen, but it's not enough at all.

424
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,020
I don't know.

425
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,960
I'll pay a little.

426
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,380
Naga, please change at the convenience store in front of you.

427
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,440
I see.

428
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,780
Do you have to do that?

429
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,080
I do!

430
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Please wait a little while to stay here for a while.

431
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,240
Hey, customer!

432
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,100
If you do that, you'll fill up too much laundry!

433
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,940
That's not the duty of the exit office, Ryo!

434
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,660
What?

435
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,720
Are you trying to serve the public?

436
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,800
Did you think about it?

437
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,800
I may want to stay here.

438
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:17,980
Do you want to wait here?

439
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,800
No, I think that's dangerous.

440
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,840
Let's go.

441
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,900
Let's go before the end.

442
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,080
Let's go before the end?

443
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,100
No, please.

444
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,480
Let's go.

445
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,560
Please.

446
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:26,620
Please.

447
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
It's a temporary escape room!

448
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,700
Here!

449
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,580
No one can get in here!

450
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,300
You can get a temporary escape room that won't get in the way of anyone!

451
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
It's just a street.

452
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,240
What if it rains?

453
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,660
You can't work in a place like this, Ryo.

454
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,300
Leave it to me!

455
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,760
It's like an eel's sleeping room escape room.

456
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,160
Even if you put a chair in this small room, you can't use the desk.

457
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,940
This will be the desk.

458
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,280
I'll write the documents like this.

459
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,580
I see.

460
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,800
If it's not a temporary escape room, you can't get in and out of here.

461
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,840
That's solved too.

462
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,180
This way, there's no danger of an emergency exit.

463
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,740
Only Ryo-chan can do that.

464
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,000
It's not a temporary escape room.

465
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,740
The three floors of the building next door are soba restaurants.

466
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,340
There are also a beef bowl and a bento shop here, so it's easy to come and go.

467
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,600
Oh, I won't let you guys have a hard time!

468
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,700
Somehow, I feel like this is the best place I've ever been.

469
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,040
That's right. If you live here, it's a capital.

470
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,380
Above all, it's nice to be able to relax without anyone's care.

471
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,260
Let's decide!

472
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
Then, this is my temporary escape room in front of Kameari Park!

473
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,100
The temporary escape room in front of the park!

474
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,280
What?

475
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,100
Stop it!

476
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,040
Get out of the way!

477
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,460
What?

478
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,100
Damn it! What's going on?

479
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,080
I see. This alley is the shortcut to the station, Ryo-san.

480
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,120
Oh, the morning commute rush!

481
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
Our escape room is...

482
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,340
Hey...

483
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,400
Yes?

484
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,360
Huh? The escape room is ready?

485
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,200
Is it ready?

486
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,860
Y-Yes! The escape room!

487
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,640
It's the escape room, Reiko-san!

488
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah, it's not an illusion, is it?

489
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,420
We're finally back!

490
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,600
We're finally back!

491
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,780
It's our escape room!

492
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,640
Then, I'll give you the sign.

493
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,960
You did a good job.

494
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,020
Well, I'll leave it to you to take care of your family.

495
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,400
What?

496
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,600
Huh?

497
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,760
Oh!

498
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,060
We've been waiting for you, Chief!

499
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,360
Did you use magic?

500
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm glad you made it in time.

501
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm Yamashita, the Chief of Staff.

502
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,740
Then, I'll start the investigation of the escape room.

503
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,300
Please, please!

504
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,240
Come on!

505
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,020
Oh!

506
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,980
Oh my gosh!

507
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,200
Where's the exit here?

508
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,380
Where is it?

509
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,560
It's right here!

510
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
I see and I know!

511
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,680
Here it is!

512
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,800
The escape room!

513
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,060
LUYOSAN!

514
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,940
What is this?

515
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:53,960
What is it?

516
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,260
It must be a hidden entrance ...

517
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,480
A secret entrance.

518
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,620
Move quickly!

519
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,640
Hey, what's wrong?

520
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:03,980
Where did you get the restaurant?

521
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, where did you get the restaurant?

522
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,280
It's broken!

523
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,080
No!

524
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,460
What's this?

525
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,040
As you ordered, it's a paper craft that Marufuska made and completed.

526
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,620
Huh?

527
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,320
For now, if it looks like it,

528
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,180
it can be a paper craft or a writing board, anything is fine!

529
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,780
I'm counting on you!

530
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,620
Paper craft...

531
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,140
What do you mean by this?

532
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,320
Can you explain?

533
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,600
It's impossible to re-create a real writing board in two days!

534
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,980
Wait!

535
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,740
Hey!

536
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,480
It's so...

537
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,140
Kyoichi!

538
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,300
You bastard!

539
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,360
B-BAKENMON!

540
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,100
Huh?

541
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,580
Ah, right!

542
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
Can I do a California roll?

543
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh!

544
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,040
I don't want a California roll!

545
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,160
This isn't America!

546
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,180
I'm sorry!

547
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,460
Um...

548
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,500
Um...

549
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,700
Excuse me!

550
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,020
Yes, sir!

551
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,200
Well,

552
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,680
Kushi-age, Kaki-age, Katsu-age, whatever, Age-age, what was it again?

553
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,260
What do you recommend?

554
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,600
Just be careful with Katsu-age!

555
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,700
Huh?

556
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,180
That's...

557
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,640
What does "Oyaji gag" mean?

558
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,380
Well, I'm so sorry!

559
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,880
I don't get it!

560
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,080
Huh?

561
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,720
Huh?

562
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,780
Who...?

563
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,260
Who?

564
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,040
Who?

565
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,200
Who?

566
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,400
Who?

567
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,860
Seriously?

568
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,960
Welcome!

569
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,040
Welcome!

570
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,220
Please come in!

571
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,560
Welcome!

572
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,800
Welcome!

573
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,180
Please come in!

574
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,320
Welcome!

575
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,640
Welcome!

576
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,180
Welcome!

577
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,720
Please come in!

578
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,720
Welcome!

579
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,140
Welcome!

580
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,280
Welcome!

581
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:26,980
Welcome!

582
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,220
Welcome!

583
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,680
I was forced to meet President Ohara

584
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,620
I thought that a good partner would come

585
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,840
This is amazing

586
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,260
She is beautiful, kind and can do anything

587
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,500
Moreover, she seems to like me

588
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,360
Next time, Ryo's love declaration

589
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,460
Thank you

590
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,940
Thank you
