00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,280
"Tick! Tick!"

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,380
♪ I gaze at that day ♪

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,560
♪ Which floats within me ♪

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,800
♪ As I pounce on theะ stone ♪

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,360
♪ I fly up to my shoes ♪

6
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,380
From the water of the Tunganiposhi

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:07,080
To the Taishakuten, the sunset falls

8
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow will end like this

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,500
I lost my happiness at Katsushikashiba

10
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,360
I lost my happiness at Katsushikashiba

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,120
I realized that I was stupid

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:47,060
Well, I want something sweet for tea

13
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,720
I realized that I was stupid

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,860
I realized that I was stupid

15
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,720
Well, I'll try it

16
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,020
Ryo-san, you are a great digger

17
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,460
Later

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
Great luck

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,860
Great luck

20
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,980
It was good

21
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,760
Ryo-san, I'll send you the patrol

22
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,000
Great luck

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Great luck

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,500
ryo-san

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,040
Ryo-san

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,020
I want something sweet

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,480
I want something sweet

28
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,040
It was in the kitchen. Do you know what a daifuku is?

29
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,920
Huh? I don't know what a daifuku is.

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,100
Really?

31
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,840
I really don't know what it is.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
What happened?

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
I kept it in the kitchen. My daifuku is gone.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,460
No, I haven't eaten it.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,380
I don't know either.

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,300
That means...

37
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,140
I can't eat it.

38
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,460
Chief, try to say "Ee".

39
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,140
What?

40
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,780
Not "Ee". Say "Ee" like this.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,360
Why would I do that?

42
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,180
Is there a reason why you can't do it?

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,420
No, there isn't.

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,260
Say "Ee".

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,480
I'll crush you. I'll crush you.

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,320
The culprit is you, chief!

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,420
Chief!

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,060
You're so dirty.

49
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,840
You ate the daifuku that the subordinates were looking forward to.

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,620
Is that what you're doing?

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,220
The chief will take care of all the food in the kitchen.

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,600
If you leave a piece of food,

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,280
you'll eat it all.

54
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,020
That's the way humanity works.

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,300
I can't believe it.

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
As a human being.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,260
You don't have to say that.

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,300
I can't believe it. As a human being.

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,420
You don't have to say that.

60
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,400
That's right.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,500
That daifuku is what Reiko bought.

62
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,460
That's right. It's not Ryo's.

63
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm so excited.

64
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,120
In the end, you used all the money.

65
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,920
And you have nothing to eat.

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,080
That's the usual pattern.

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,360
You're so rude.

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,860
If I had that daifuku, I could eat it all day.

69
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,580
I could eat it for three days.

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,380
But you have nothing to eat.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,920
It was worth 10,000 yen to me.

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,820
That's what the部長...

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,780
Ah it's the director...

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,100
In the end, the manager ate it all.

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,700
I thought it was only the director.

76
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,080
I don't know what to believe anymore.

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
I know.

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,240
Daifuku, you have to cheer.

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
Daifuku ...

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
I don't know.

81
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,600
After all, this is...

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not far enough to have three daifuku in one day.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,080
It will not heal my heart.

84
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,280
Usually, the chief always says that he thinks about his subordinates.

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,420
But this is completely different.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,080
I wonder if it is okay for someone who thinks about his subordinates to raise his subordinates.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,920
I understand.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,200
I will pay you 10,000 yen for a car.

89
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,660
Really, chief?

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,540
Yes.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,700
However, I don't have any cash here.

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,540
Why?

93
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,880
It's about you.

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,820
If you give me cash, I will use it for fun again.

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,820
You can say that.

96
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,140
That's your usual pattern.

97
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,720
Then how can you pay me 10,000 yen?

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,580
That's it.

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,800
The world's food is free to eat?

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
I will pay you 10,000 yen for the admission fee.

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,580
I can talk to you.

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,960
Chief, let's go.

103
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,780
Wait.

104
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,240
Look here.

105
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
5 days until the opening.

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,760
This is the famous Skyville 50.

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
It's crowded today.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,280
Everyone is looking for Sky Vikings.

109
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
By the way, where is Ryo-tsu?

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,660
He is too hungry to walk.

111
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,700
So he said he would come by his motorcycle.

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:46,260
I'm here.

113
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,260
Ryo-tsu's husband.

114
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,220
Ouch.

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm too hungry.

116
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:49,980
Ouch.

117
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,600
You are so annoying.

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,300
I want to go to the car.

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,660
Let's go.

120
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,160
My body has terrible health when I have only water for 5 days.

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,280
For the sake of today,

122
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,920
I will eat 10,000 yen for 10,000 yen.

123
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,280
I will eat 10,000 yen for 10,000 yen.

124
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,700
Pay me dearly.

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,240
10,000 yen.

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,960
Right.

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,300
What do you say for 10,000 yen?

128
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,820
I can't pay, but I will pay you 10,000 yen and 635 yen

129
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,380
It would be a small price for a daily meal fee,

130
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,020
What? This isn't enough?

131
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,140
What a shame, Ryotsu.

132
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,440
I said I would give you exactly 10,000 yen.

133
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,400
How disgusting.

134
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,120
Where is the 10,000 yen limit?

135
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,740
Here you go.

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,380
Now I can eat the cost of consumption.

137
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,100
I will eat the cost of consumption.

138
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,980
I have it. I have it.

139
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,500
Stop it, you idiot.

140
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,160
It's disgusting.

141
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,380
But you managed to get all these dishes.

142
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,340
I'm so happy.

143
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,680
I've never eaten anything like this.

144
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,580
All the famous dishes from all over the world are on this floor.

145
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,820
There is no time limit.

146
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,380
Please enjoy your meal.

147
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,440
It's delicious.

148
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,000
This looks tasty.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,260
Ryotsu!

150
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,560
Eat the things that look tasty even if you push people away.

151
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,620
This is my skill.

152
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,700
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

153
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,500
It's a disaster!

154
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,240
That's quite a lot.

155
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,000
Of course. It's a waste of time to go get it at this hour.

156
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,640
There's no time limit.

157
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,860
Yeah. If we keep on going, we might get eaten by someone.

158
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,220
It's not a human trick.

159
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,820
Well, let's get going.

160
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,480
Senpai, can you go to the bathroom with me?

161
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,140
What? You're not going alone. You're like a woman.

162
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,480
Please. It's too big and confusing.

163
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,400
Right, Senpai?

164
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,340
Yeah, I know.

165
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,340
No, I sent you here.

166
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,020
Right, Senpai?

167
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,940
I can't help it.

168
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,900
But good things don't go away quickly in the viking world.

169
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,920
I'm your assistant.

170
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,140
Hurry up and do it.

171
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,500
One more plate.

172
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,320
What?

173
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,480
Who is it? It's impossible!

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,020
I can't do it.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
Hurry up and let all the people in the building escape!

176
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,740
Got it.

177
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,380
Everyone, please calm down and listen.

178
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
An emergency has occurred in the building.

179
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,860
An emergency?

180
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,680
We've received a call from the fire station on the 35th floor.

181
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
A fire station?

182
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,500
Why is there such a thing?

183
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,600
We're not worried about it right now.

184
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,820
But please think about what you're doing.

185
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,740
Please leave the food as it is and stay calm and evacuate.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,240
It's become a big deal.

187
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,680
Let's cooperate and lead the evacuation.

188
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,780
Everyone, hurry up and do it.

189
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,580
Please act calmly.

190
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,680
Please hurry up and go to the elevator.

191
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,040
Don't rush.

192
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,200
We have time.

193
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,100
Stay calm.

194
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm sorry, Senpai.

195
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,560
You're late.

196
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,460
I ate two plates.

197
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,060
Go back.

198
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,920
Hurry up.

199
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,440
Yes.

200
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,620
Let's finish this together.

201
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,700
Thank you all for your help.

202
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,560
Thank you for your cooperation.

203
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,940
Now, this elevator will be closed.

204
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,880
What?

205
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,880
It's a fire station.

206
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,980
It's a fire station.

207
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,060
It's a fire station.

208
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,260
I didn't see you and Mr. Honda there.

209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
Yeah, they ran away to Ino market.

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,580
If they come, I'll be in trouble.

211
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,860
With the food in front of us?

212
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,180
We can't do this! Run!

213
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,220
Damn it!

214
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,900
Let's get out of here!

215
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,300
Let's!

216
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,140
What?

217
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,100
What's wrong with this building?

218
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,260
It's like a maze.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,280
Senpai, it's this way.

220
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,320
Hurry! The food will be gone!

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,980
If it's gone, it's your fault!

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
You should've prepared for that!

223
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,400
What?

224
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,600
What?

225
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,960
No one's here.

226
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,860
Did everyone leave?

227
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,180
It's true.

228
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,460
Whatever.

229
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,560
It's just a matter of time.

230
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,520
Let's eat!

231
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,760
Let's eat!

232
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,080
Yay! We can eat anything!

233
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,320
-Let's eat! -Let's eat!

234
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,120
Come on!

235
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,380
"The

236
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,280
-The

237
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,660
is gone.-

238
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,240
He's nowhere.

239
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,060
So he's still in there.

240
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,420
Man were you there?

241
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,740
Yeah, I did.

242
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,880
Eat more of these expensive things like caviar and foie gras!

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,860
Yes, sir.

244
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,400
Don't you think it's a bit disgusting?

245
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,660
That's right.

246
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
You're doing an attraction outside, aren't you?

247
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,260
Maybe.

248
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,000
You're so noisy at such a good time for a meal.

249
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,100
Hello?

250
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,640
Ryotsu!

251
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm surprised. Are you alright?

252
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,480
What happened to you? You left early.

253
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,240
Listen, Ryotsu. Listen carefully.

254
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,540
A fire broke out on the 35th floor of this building.

255
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,920
The building is on fire!

256
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,760
What?

257
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,440
Wait, Ryotsu.

258
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,780
You're not getting in my way.

259
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,480
You're not lying!

260
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Ryotsu.

261
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,860
I paid 635 yen.

262
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,560
I'll eat a full 100,000 yen bill and go home.

263
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,660
You're going to be surprised.

264
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,480
It's really fire!

265
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,820
You're the ones who are left in the building.

266
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,420
You're the ones who are left in the building.

267
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,920
You're the only two left.

268
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,980
Everyone has already evacuated.

269
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm scared, Ryotsu.

270
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,180
I'm going to be a yakitori.

271
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,620
Don't be afraid.

272
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,140
Listen to me.

273
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,780
We can't use the elevator anymore.

274
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,840
We're waiting here until we get out of here.

275
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,060
Got it, Ryotsu?

276
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,060
You can't act on your own!

277
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm trapped!

278
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,600
Don't be angry, Honda!

279
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,580
This is disgusting!

280
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
Wait a minute!

281
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,340
Where are you going, Ryotsu?

282
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,100
Don't leave me!

283
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,620
I'm the one who's leaving!

284
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,280
I'll take care of the fire extinguisher first.

285
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,700
Turn off the fire extinguisher.

286
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,780
Come on, get in here.

287
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,080
In the meantime, I'll have a meal.

288
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,640
You're going to eat again in this state?

289
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,160
I came here to eat a full 100,000 yen.

290
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,540
I paid 635 yen.

291
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,420
I'll eat no matter what!

292
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
I'll eat no matter what!

293
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,580
A live broadcast from the site of the fire.

294
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,380
There are two more people inside.

295
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,200
Oh, I just caught two people.

296
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,740
They're eating!

297
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,480
He's crazy.

298
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,900
Ryotsu, you're eating with a smile on your face.

299
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,520
You're the same as everyone else.

300
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,320
Raoh!

301
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,920
What's going on?

302
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,440
What's that explosion?

303
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
The gas station on the second floor exploded.

304
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,980
Why is there such a thing in the building?

305
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,940
I'm so mad at the electrical system.

306
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,160
Damn it!

307
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,740
It's burning! It's burning!

308
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,320
The fire is getting faster and faster.

309
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,140
Eat it quickly!

310
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,620
I can't eat it!

311
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,060
If you eat it, you'll die.

312
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,760
It's running!

313
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,020
The fire is already starting.

314
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't make a fuss over it!

315
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,040
We're safe here anyway.

316
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,140
Hey, hey!

317
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,960
We're safe here anyway.

318
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,480
We're safe here anyway.

319
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,540
calm down calm down

320
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,720
Don't move!

321
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
It's not good to eat with a calm mind.

322
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,760
I can't take it anymore.

323
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm going to remember this

324
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,500
I'm going to remember this

325
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,420
I'm going to remember this

326
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm going to remember this

327
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,360
No way!

328
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,980
Come on!

329
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
Help me, quick!

330
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,540
We'll be done in a few minutes.

331
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,660
We simmered for a good bit.

332
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,240
Not good...

333
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,160
There's no firewood!

334
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,420
Is there anything at the kitchen?

335
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,160
Oh, there's something good.

336
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,980
Honda, bring the soup!

337
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,500
All right, it's a waste of time, but we can save the fire.

338
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,280
Three!

339
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,480
Idiot! That's oil!

340
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,700
I don't care anymore!

341
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,420
Are you still eating?

342
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,880
Hey, Ryotsu, do you hear me?

343
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,360
The rescue helicopter is heading to the roof.

344
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,280
There is a emergency staircase in the kitchen.

345
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,500
You should be able to get out of there.

346
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,660
Go straight ahead!

347
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,060
Oh, no!

348
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,600
I don't want to eat anymore.

349
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,820
If this happens, I'll take the whole thing with me.

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,240
Let's leave the food and run away!

351
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,740
Shut up!

352
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,280
Here?

353
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,620
Oh, no! The fire!

354
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,980
What? We're breaking through the barrier!

355
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,620
Let's go!

356
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,140
Wait a minute!

357
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,860
The dessert for the consumption tax...

358
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,780
Let's get out of here!

359
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,740
Are you all all right?

360
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
Let's get out of here!

361
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:38,760
Who is this?

362
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,540
Are you all right?

363
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

364
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,720
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

365
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,340
I forgot to tell you, but there is a firework show in the roof.

366
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,240
Be careful!

367
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,340
Why are they all here?

368
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,660
Mario Intensifies

369
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,380
Mario Continues

370
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,040
Don't get any closer!

371
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,940
Just shoot there!

372
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,820
Huh?

373
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,920
We've driven all the way to here!

374
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,800
Are we leaving this in there?

375
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,800
Hurry up!

376
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,380
I've had it with this!

377
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,100
Are you going to carry it?

378
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,360
I'm a child.

379
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,560
Cabrio in pocket.

380
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,020
Escalbo in pants.

381
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,160
All right, that's exactly what I need.

382
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,880
100,000 yen!

383
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,060
You're going to jump off like that?

384
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,020
I can't do it.

385
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,900
All right, Honda, go ahead!

386
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,580
Yeah!

387
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:55,740
What?

388
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,880
You've got to speed it up!

389
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,140
How dare you!!!

390
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,900
I'm in trouble!

391
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,180
I call the shots!

392
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,080
No, stop!

393
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,860
The wash machine is over there.

394
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,300
It's not that tough.

395
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,180
Let's get out of here.

396
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,060
Ryo!

397
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,280
We'll get it.

398
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,900
I'll do it.

399
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm stuck.

400
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,320
But it's heavy.

401
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,280
I'll cut it.

402
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,640
Throw away the food.

403
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,340
No, I can't do that.

404
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,380
I can't carry so much food.

405
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,760
I can't carry so much food.

406
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,200
You can't be human in a place like this.

407
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,040
You can't be human in a place like this.

408
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,480
Are you going to die for food?

409
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,940
Are you going to die for food?

410
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:34,240
I'll get you!

411
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,740
No!

412
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,800
No, no, no!

413
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,880
I can't!

414
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,280
I can't!

415
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,900
He changed the table cross to a parachute!

417
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,380
As expected of you, Senpai. You're not human!

418
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,360
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,600
Senpai!

420
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,420
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,380
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm so frustrated.

423
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,860
The Escargot and the Lobster...

424
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,940
I brought them all, but they all got broken.

425
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,800
I haven't even eaten a 10,000 yen bill yet.

426
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,560
I heard that food is more important to him than life.

427
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,140
Please give me money again.

428
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,960
Take me to the Viking.

429
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,420
I don't care, you idiot!

430
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,460
What?

431
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,560
Gunter!

432
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,420
Gunter!

433
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,160
Gunter!

434
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,320
Gunter!

435
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,280
Gunter!

436
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:50,920
Gunter!

437
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:05,840
Hey, Shiratori Reiji!

438
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,920
You were impressed by your father,

439
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,320
and became a super poor man, weren't you?

440
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,580
Did you invite Reiko to a date again?

441
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,380
French cuisine, you say?

442
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,660
I'll go with you.

443
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
Next time on "Saitoujo Shiratori Race."

444
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,180
I'm counting on you!

Yui

458
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm the one who has so much love

459
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,440
I want to run on a bike through the vast desert

460
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,160
I want to be free more than a bird

461
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:10,020
A lady's dream that changes with the speed of a full moon

462
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm sorry, wait for me

463
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,600
The future of the panorama is so bright

464
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,680
You understand, right?

465
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm sorry, wait for me

466
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
