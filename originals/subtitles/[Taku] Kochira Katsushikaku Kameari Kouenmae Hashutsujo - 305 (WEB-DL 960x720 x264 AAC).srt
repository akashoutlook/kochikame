It's so good!

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,720
Thank you for the meal, Reiko-san.

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,780
You're welcome.

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,100
You guys shouldn't skip patrol and drink tea like that.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
But it's cold outside.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,180
It's a little bit nice, right?

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,140
You're riding a mini-pat.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,640
It's true that it's getting really cold lately.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,600
It's winter already.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,060
Speaking of winter...

33
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,220
Right, speaking of winter...

34
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,260
Ishi-yaki-imo!

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,020
Here it comes!

36
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,700
Here it comes!

37
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,820
Chachachachachach!

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,980
Delicious, delicious potatoes!

39
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,040
Here you go. Thank you.

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
Mister, can I have one?

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,260
Me too!

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,520
Yes, yes. Just a moment, please.

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,680
What? Ishi-yaki-imo?

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
I'll go buy some, too.

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,940
Why do women like yaki-imo?

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
It's a typical winter sweet.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,140
It's rich in fiber and it's cheap.

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,340
Huh?

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,260
Our bio-development factory is in trouble because we've taken too many sweet potatoes.

50
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,380
Should we donate them to the office?

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,920
What?

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,860
Wait a minute! I'll get rid of those sweet potatoes!

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,980
What?

54
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,440
A fierce battle! The Night Market War in front of the station!

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,600
Hey, Gimpo-ji!

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,580
What is it, Mister?

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,180
What is this?

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,320
What is it? It's an octopus.

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,340
Don't ask me that!

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm asking you what this cut is.

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,120
A cut?

62
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,520
We sell the biggest octopus in Japan.

63
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,900
That's too small.

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,940
I'm sorry!

65
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,680
Do it again.

66
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,020
You'll lose customers' trust.

67
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,320
Yes, sir!

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,360
I remember that the company where my brother worked was destroyed by customers' complaints.

69
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,500
Yes.

70
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,320
It was said that it was a fraud.

71
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
I realized that at that time.

72
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,740
Business is best done on a daily basis.

73
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,460
Excuse me.

74
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,160
Two takoyaki, please.

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,560
Yes, I'm home.

76
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,420
Hey, wait a minute!

77
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,740
Thank you for coming every time.

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,640
I'll come again.

79
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,460
That's why I'm selling you a pack of takoyaki for 400 yen today.

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,900
That's right.

81
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,260
Ferrari!

82
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,220
What?

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,480
You know that?

84
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,300
I was a dealer before I got a job as a restoration worker.

85
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,160
One day, we will...

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,060
I'd like to be able to ride a Ferrari.

87
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,160
Ferrari can't do a yatei.

88
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,380
Yakiimo!

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,780
What was that?

90
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,620
Ferrari's Yakiimo Yatei?

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,740
No way...

92
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,620
But it's true, the back of the Ferrari was a Yakiimo Yatei.

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,360
It was a Ferrari.

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,820
Yakiimo!

95
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,120
It's a Ferrari!

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,660
The car just now was going around.

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,140
It's delicious, it's delicious.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,400
Nakagawa, you're going too fast. Lower the speed.

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
It's impossible to keep going in the low.

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,880
I'll tell you if you don't come soon.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,160
Here it is.

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,220
It was a Ferrari!

103
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,300
It was a Yakiimo Yatei.

104
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,180
It's impossible to keep going.

105
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,380
Bro!

106
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,160
Are you okay?

107
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,040
What kind of car is this?

108
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,060
Running while dropping the firewood?

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,660
I feel like I'm back.

110
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,500
I'll give you some advice.

111
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Bro, the opponent is a Ferrari.

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,860
I don't know what kind of rich people are on it.

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,360
I don't know!

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Are you afraid of the rich and doing takoyaki?

115
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,280
Fire...

116
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,880
Hey, hey!

117
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
Running while burning a car on fire...

118
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,940
What kind of rich people are on it?

119
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,460
What kind of rich people are on it?

120
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,500
What's wrong with that?

121
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,900
What's wrong with that?

122
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,340
Sir.

123
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm sure there's no law prohibiting the road traffic law to run while burning a car on fire.

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
I agree.

125
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,920
But it's impossible to burn a Yakiimo in my car.

126
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,620
It's too fast.

127
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,140
I see. It can't be helped.

128
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,840
I'll stop the car around here and start a business.

129
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,820
That's right.

130
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,480
What?

131
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,560
What?

132
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,720
You can't start a business?

133
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,340
No, not at all.

134
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,340
Please do your best.

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,180
What's wrong with the police?

136
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,040
And it's Ferrari.

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't know.

138
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,860
But I can't do anything about it.

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,360
Well, well.

140
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,340
The world's first Ferrari Yakiimo shop is open today.

141
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,980
Welcome, welcome.

142
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
It's a delicious Yakiimo.

143
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,500
Give me one.

144
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,640
Here, two.

145
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,580
Yes, yes.

146
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,800
Thank you very much.

147
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,060
Cool.

148
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,640
Hey, don't swear at people who don't buy.

149
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,560
How about another one for the ladies?

150
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,420
Yes.

151
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,280
The customers are amazing.

152
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,260
Well.

153
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,500
All my customers have brought it.

154
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,440
Even when they're in the middle of writing.

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,140
This happens when you're doing business.

156
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,300
I can't stand it at times like this.

157
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,040
I can't stand it.

158
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,100
Thank you.

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,700
Here you go.

160
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,040
I'll take three.

161
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,740
Yes, three please.

162
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,900
Please take two.

163
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,380
Thank you so much.

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,240
Thank you so much.

165
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,960
The next day.

166
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't have sweet potatoes anymore?

167
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,860
Well, yeah.

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,180
I mean, I still have a lot yesterday, right?

169
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,160
That's because the person in charge of the company is trying to donate a lot to the children of the country who are suffering from disaster.

170
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,240
And the children are now on the plane.

171
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,560
What a story this is.

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,700
No, it's not.

173
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,960
It was just about to happen.

174
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,680
You should give up on the idea of doing business on the street.

175
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,540
Nakagawa, you have several laboratories in your company, right?

176
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,380
Don't you have any other places that have left over potatoes?

177
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,580
I heard that there are still octopus left in the marine research team of the marine research institute.

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,620
Octopus?

179
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,860
It's not baked potatoes, it's takoyaki.

180
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,220
It's not baked, but it's takoyaki.

181
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,900
What?

182
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,060
No, it's takoyaki.

183
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,740
You're not here today, are you?

184
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,120
Ferrari's baked potato shop.

185
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,020
I'm not here.

186
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm here.

187
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,600
I have...

188
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,100
The largest octopus in Japan.

189
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,220
As long as I have this, I won't lose anywhere.

190
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,020
Brother!

191
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,100
Yes?

192
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,820
What's wrong?

193
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,940
Look at that.

194
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,720
Huh?

195
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,080
A takoyaki with a whole octopus!

196
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,540
Don't... Don't joke around!

197
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,440
If you have a whole octopus...

198
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,000
It'll become this huge!

199
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,580
How do you sell that?

200
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,740
How do you eat it?

201
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,720
I can't do that.

202
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,240
It's an unvaccinated word.

203
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,260
I'll complain about it.

204
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,080
No!

205
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,380
No!

206
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,220
No!

207
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
No!

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,480
No!

209
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,600
No!

210
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,680
No, no, no!

211
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,860
No, no!

212
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,300
No!

213
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,940
No, no, no!

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,520
No, no, no!

215
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,320
No!

216
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,360
No!

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,540
No!

218
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,400
No!

219
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
I know how much you're a liar, but...

220
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,400
If there's one octopus in a whole octopus,

221
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,960
I think it's a bit exaggerated.

222
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,960
Do you want to say it's a bad display?

223
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,620
No, it's not that bad.

224
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,060
There's one octopus in a whole octopus.

225
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,940
Look at this one.

226
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,760
It's small in size, but it's got one whole octopus in it.

227
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
That's a good octopus.

228
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Yes, yes, there really is one octopus in it.

229
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,340
I know.

230
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,220
That's what a police officer does.

231
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,840
It's almost a fraud.

232
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,320
You're going to perform?

233
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,500
You can't discriminate against me to win in front of the station.

234
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,760
If you ask me, it'll lead to revitalization.

235
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,420
Are you really going to do this?

236
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,960
It's okay. I'll definitely take it.

237
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,780
Hey, waiter! Thank you for coming!

238
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,500
You're welcome.

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,180
I'm coming today.

240
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,780
You know, those police officers...

241
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,060
Don't worry about it.

242
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,380
I'm here to make takoyaki all day long.

243
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,560
Gimpachiri, it's on fire!

244
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,360
You're going to burn yourself!

245
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,320
Oh, I'm sorry!

246
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,860
Takoyaki is more important than anything else.

247
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,620
Huh?

248
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,400
Fire!

249
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,120
That police officer...

250
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,640
Hurray! Hurray!

251
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,160
Yeah! Come on, baby!

252
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,920
It's a fire dance!

253
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,400
Oh! Takoyaki!

254
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah! Takoyaki!

255
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,340
Yeah!

256
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,720
Mmm! Takoyaki is delicious!

257
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,860
Hey! Fire dance!

258
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
Yeah! Rainbow!

259
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,240
Yeah! Yeah! Everyone, buy it!

260
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
What's that?

261
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,920
It's just an insect. Don't worry about it.

262
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,160
This way, this way!

263
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh! They're really doing it!

264
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,460
- Turn the camera! - Yes!

265
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,140
Um, what's this?

266
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,360
To the station.

267
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,600
There was a special call that said there was a takoyaki shop that makes takoyaki while dancing fire dance.

268
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,760
Yeah, this will work. Let's go!

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Yes!

270
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,720
As expected of the TV station. The information is fast.

271
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,380
It's okay to be a little wild, so cut your chin.

272
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes.

273
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,820
Buy takoyaki!

274
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,740
Buy more!

275
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,520
Three more!

276
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,280
Buy more!

277
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,140
Five!

278
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,360
Buy more!

279
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,720
No! Thank you!

280
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,420
Thank you every time!

281
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,980
Thank you!

282
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,220
Ah, the TV station! Finally!

283
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Okay! Nakagawa! Increase the fire power!

284
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,980
Senpai! It's dangerous to increase the fire power any further!

285
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,640
I called the TV station! I have to do it more flashy!

286
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,960
But!

287
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,020
Hey! Fire!

288
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,580
I'll do it myself!

289
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,140
I'll show you a special show from now on! Fire!

290
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,860
Fire!

291
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,260
Senpai!

292
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,360
It's amazing!

293
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,080
You do as expected. It has power!

294
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,020
Uh, isn't it round?

295
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,120
It's iku takoyaki!

296
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,260
Engage!

297
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,420
Brother, that police officer...

298
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,760
He told me not to worry about it!

299
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,200
But he's coming this way!

300
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:33,900
What?

301
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,820
Damn!

302
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm sick and tired of Takoyaki!

303
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
Okay, it's done!

304
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,220
Wow, it looks delicious!

305
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,620
Now, let's try it!

306
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,640
It's delicious, Ryo-chan!

307
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,600
You're as good as a professional!

308
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,460
Right?

309
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,520
But, usually, the Taiyaki has anko in the tail, right?

310
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,020
This doesn't have it.

311
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,640
No, no. The tail is the same as the corn in ice cream.

312
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,200
You eat it after the sweet one and then you eat it again.

313
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,420
Yes, it's refreshing and delicious!

314
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,600
You're right!

315
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,200
It's a Taiyaki set that was sold in the shopping street, but it also has flour and anko as the ingredients, so it's pretty authentic.

316
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,680
I made it!

317
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,240
Speaking of anko, it's a problem that we can't get azuki beans in our bioplant.

318
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,240
What?

319
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,100
If that's the case, leave it to me!

320
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,960
Hey, Silver-Hair!

321
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,100
What is it, Aniki?

322
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
What is this?

323
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,780
What is it? It's an all-purpose green onion.

324
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,380
Don't ask me that! I'm asking you what this cutting method is!

325
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,720
Cutting method?

326
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,680
You didn't cut it.

327
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,460
Oh, sorry!

328
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,300
When you cut an all-purpose green onion,

329
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,340
you should use your left hand as a tool to cut it.

330
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,300
I'm Izumikaru Aniki.

331
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,140
If you can't do this, you won't be a good carpenter.

332
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
As expected of you, Aniki!

333
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,240
I've been doing this for 25 years.

334
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,460
Aniki!

335
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,400
What's wrong?

336
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,480
There's a strange car.

337
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,700
What?

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,980
A Taiyaki!

339
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,820
I thought a disturbing policeman had disappeared, but it's a Taiyaki shop this time!

340
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,500
What are you going to do, Aniki?

341
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,940
All right!

342
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll teach you how to do it!

343
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,360
You're so cool, Aniki!

344
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,240
Give me an old man's Takoyaki!

345
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,200
Welcome!

346
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,220
Hey, wait!

347
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,200
Don't take it off because it's heavy!

348
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,520
Yes!

349
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,400
Bye-bye!

350
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,600
Thank you very much!

351
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,620
Wait, Aniki!

352
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,540
This business is the first customer, so...

353
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,120
All right, let's go!

354
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,280
Don't underestimate me!

355
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
Two Takoyaki, please!

356
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,600
Yes, yes, I'm home.

357
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,100
This Takoyaki is delicious.

358
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,940
Right?

359
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,280
Takoyaki is different.

360
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,740
Thank you very much!

361
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
Thank you very much!

362
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,440
Aniki, when are you going?

363
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,200
Wait a minute.

364
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,040
If I don't cook it now, I'll have to wait for the customer.

365
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,600
That's true, but...

366
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,860
I'll make it a little thicker.

367
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,640
It's pretty detailed.

368
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,400
All right, let's go!

369
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,020
Yes!

370
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,100
Two Takoyaki, please!

371
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,560
Here too!

372
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,140
Yes, yes, I'm waiting.

373
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,040
What's this?

374
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,640
There are too many people, so I can't go forward.

375
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,020
It's okay.

376
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,780
Go back to the store and bring me the soy sauce can.

377
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,460
Soy sauce can?

378
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,440
Yes, Aniki!

379
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,020
Is that okay?

380
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,340
All right, take a good look.

381
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,300
Yes!

382
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,980
Get out of the way!

383
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Who did you refuse to work for?

384
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
The police officer...

385
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:13,980
What?

386
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,920
It's you again!

387
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,480
Do you need anything?

388
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,480
No, please do your best.

389
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,020
What were those two doing?

390
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,880
I don't know.

391
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,440
What's going on?

392
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,080
When he comes again...

393
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,060
Are you ignoring him this time?

394
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,160
If I ignore him, he will definitely have an influence on us.

395
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,900
Like the last time...

396
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,300
He's like that.

397
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,800
Then...

398
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,160
He's been like that for a long time.

399
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,020
When I left the company, you were fired.

400
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
The work that we started...

401
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,020
We're finally on track.

402
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,480
You can't be crushed here.

403
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,300
Aniki...

404
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
It's war.

405
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,380
I'll use all my know-hows and crush you!

406
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,820
Aniki!

407
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,380
-The next day-

408
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,580
Alright, I'll make some money today too!

409
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,540
Senpai?

410
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,800
What's up?

411
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,760
The takoyaki place across the street is a Taiyaki place!

412
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,880
What?

413
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,580
The tasty, tasty custard cream is the best!

414
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,380
Taiyaki Hitosugi 25 years, it's the best taste!

415
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,620
One Taiyaki please!

416
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,420
Me too!

417
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,680
Eh, wait!

418
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,160
Thank you very much!

419
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,940
Boss, you did a great job!

420
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,440
I'll beat that police officer to death with this!

421
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,600
Custard cream?

422
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,840
How about that!

423
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,720
But it's on sale!

424
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,700
Alright, I'll take that!

425
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,380
I'll take this too!

426
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,920
Nakagawa, get the custard cream!

427
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Yes!

428
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,460
Hey, wait!

429
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,680
Thank you very much!

430
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,140
Huh?

431
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,340
From now on, we will also sell custard cream-like Taiyaki!

432
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,600
And it's sweet, and it's half calories!

433
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,660
Even the size is smaller!

434
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,660
It's half calories!

435
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,980
It's smaller, and it's easier to eat!

436
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,300
Oh, thank you!

437
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,360
Hello, customer!

438
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,900
Welcome, welcome!

439
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,580
Thank you very much!

440
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,060
We got a customer!

441
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
Don't copy us!

442
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm the police officer of the city!

443
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,440
What are you going to do, boss?

444
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,540
We're here to increase the variation!

445
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,240
Huh?

446
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,540
This looks fun!

447
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,340
I want to try it too!

448
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:49,800
What?

449
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:56,680
At this shop, we have various types of Taiyaki, such as chocolate, melon cream, strawberry jam, and so on!

450
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,760
Please try it once!

451
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,920
Chocolate!

452
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,460
That's funny!

453
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,120
Come on, let's go!

454
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,900
Let's go!

455
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's go!

456
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,220
Did you come with that kind of hand?

457
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,540
I can increase the variation as much as I want!

458
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm going to lose!

459
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,100
From now on, we will sell 100 types of various types of gourmet Taiyaki, including the world's first caviar, drift, foie gras, etc.

460
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,400
It is a limited sale today, so please do not miss it!

461
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,420
Caviar!

462
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
It's a limited edition!

463
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,260
Wow!

464
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,720
This is definitely...

465
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,560
It's caviar?

466
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,380
At this time, how do you spend money is different.

467
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,540
I hope there is no problem, brother ...

468
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,840
I don't have any money, so I have no wisdom!

469
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,200
The

470
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,220

*Round 2: Rice

478
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,440
It's sparkling!

*Round 2: Rice

480
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,660
The world's first rice fried dish!

481
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,400
There's a lot of ingredients in it!

482
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,540
*Round 2: Rice

483
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,560
You made it with a great skill!

484
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,900
It's just a rice ball, right?

485
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,060
It's shaped like a Taiyaki!

486
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,200
Senpai, what should we do?

487
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,780
Senpai!

488
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,600
Yes, don't rush!

489
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,460
Don't rush!

490
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Take a break!

491
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,560
Senpai!

492
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
This is the real battle!

493
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,020
The world's first Okonomiyaki Taiyaki!

494
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,340
Pour the sauce and eat it!

495
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,680
It's just Okonomiyaki!

496
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,660
Then this is...

497
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,600

We're back to the original takoyaki shop!

503
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,760
No! This is the real thing!

504
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,580
It's a Taiyaki Tempura!

505
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,480
*Round 2: Rice

506
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,820
Is it good?

507
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,500
I don't know!

508
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,780
The audience is the test subject!

509
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,580
*Round 2: Rice

510
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,880

*Round 2: Rice

515
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,860
Bring them to a deserted spot!

516
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,580
Yes, sir!

517
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,160
*Round 2: Rice

518
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,020

*Round 2: Rice

523
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,060
This was dangerous!

524
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,640
That was close.

525
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,260
That car is heading that way.

526
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,840
It's coming.

527
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,540
*Round 2: Rice

528
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,160
*Round 2: Rice

529
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,320
This is it!

530
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,960
He jumped now!

531
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,760
F-","F-F-Front! " AAA

532
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,700
AHH! At

533
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,020
least his death didn't kill him. Are

534
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,560
you alright, Boss? Thanks

535
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,920
for giving us a bit of trouble. You

536
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,200
're soаты, bet way. But

537
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,620
I never knew what would happen to us.

538
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,580
That's right.

539
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,480
What should we do, Senpai?

540
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,340
Let's jump into the river and put out the fire.

541
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,600
No, it's a pool. Jump into that.

542
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,980
I got it.

543
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,520
That color is not a pool.

544
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,720
Yes! Now we can put out the fire.

545
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Senpai, but this deck...

546
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,320
It's oil!

547
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,600
Damn it!

548
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,380
The food stall is already empty!

549
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,940
After all, the most important thing is to be stubborn.

550
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,260
Yes, that's right.

551
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,760
Damn! The people of the shopping street!

552
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,480
To take away my bonus,

553
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,860
it's a cowardly thing to hire a professional debt-taking army!

554
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,100
Every year, you and I

555
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,120
have fought the fair and square bonus debt-taking war!
