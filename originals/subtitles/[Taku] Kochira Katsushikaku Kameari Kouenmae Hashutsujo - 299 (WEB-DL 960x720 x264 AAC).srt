1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,060
Especially setting the dog by the side

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,780
When I watch TV, I always

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,980
"If you're watching TV, make your room bright and let it be free."

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,880
When I watch TV, make your room bright and let it be free.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,280
Tell me

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,500
"It's the same thing, but there's more than enough."

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:13,640
"There's more than enough."

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,880
"There's more than enough."

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,120
Tell me

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,820
"Come to me if you've got no money."

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,340
"Come to me if you've got no money."

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,540
"I don't have any money anyway, but I'm worried."

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,860
They'll be all right eventually

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,640
You understand, don't you? You understand, don't you?

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,300
If you understand, then come to me quietly!

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,980
Translated by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
Hey!

20
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,080
Hey!

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,740
Are you okay?

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,980
Water...

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Water...

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,900
Are you okay?

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,540
Where am I?

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,340
Hakodate...

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,180
Hakodate...

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,720
I'm sorry...

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,420
Who am I?

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
Who am I?

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,660
Who am I?

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,340
You don't know who you are?

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,840
Yeah, I can't remember why I'm here at all.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,860
You're losing your memories...

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,960
You don't look familiar in town.

36
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,840
I...

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Why am I calling myself as "I?"

38
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,380
Anyway, I'd like to call the police.

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,060
Police!

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,280
Policeman!? What's wrong?

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,660
When I hear "policeman" I feel somehow nostalgic and...

42
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,360
It's so painful.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,440
Okay, okay.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Then, I'll leave the police.

45
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,440
Really?

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,420
Yeah.

47
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,880
Then, do you have anything that you can understand?

48
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,820
Why do you have so many things?

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,460
I don't know.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Is there anything else?

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,520
What?

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,640
How is it?

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,040
Nothing.

54
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,720
I see. No clues.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
Then, what are you going to do from now on?

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,060
What should I do?

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,720
For now, let's come to my house.

58
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
Is that okay?

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,660
Yeah.

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,700
I'm Ryoji Kano.

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,060
My house is nearby.

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,240
Thank you.

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,020
You saved me.

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,320
Hey, Ryo!

65
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,320
Yeah?

66
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,020
What?

67
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,980
I told you to come back as soon as possible without Aya-chan.

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,820
Did you understand?

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
I understood.

70
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,960
See you.

71
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,180
You just replied, didn't you?

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,860
Yeah.

73
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,240
I just...

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,380
Maybe you were called Ryo-san, too.

75
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,020
Maybe.

76
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
Then, your name...

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
For example, Ryo-suke.

78
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,980
Hmm...

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
I think it's different.

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,420
Then, Ryohei.

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,380
Ryozo.

82
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,160
Ryota.

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,060
Ryo...

84
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,780
They all have the same...

85
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,500
I see.

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,500
Well, there's no need to be so impatient.

87
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah.

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,300
Just remember it slowly.

89
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,780
Yeah.

90
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,100
But, with that outfit, the people at home will be surprised.

91
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,940
Why are you wearing a suit?

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,220
Well, I don't know.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,540
Oh, really?

94
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,460
I think this is the most appropriate.

95
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,220
I see.

96
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,580
Memory loss?

97
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,140
Yeah.

98
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,540
I'd like you to stay at home for a while.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,340
I'm looking forward to working with you.

100
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,780
Hey.

101
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,860
Yeah.

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,080
I don't mind.

103
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,560
Hey.

104
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,180
The radio is out of service.

105
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,460
What's wrong with this girl?

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,520
She said the customer was coming.

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,040
Oh.

108
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,020
Welcome.

109
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,540
This is my sister's Ayada.

110
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,780
Good afternoon.

111
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,060
Bro, don't make me do this.

112
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,320
Don't say this to me.

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,400
Say this to your dad.

114
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,500
Can you show me that please?

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Bro, is that person at the electric shop?

116
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,260
Yeah.

117
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,020
- Here you go. - Thank you!

118
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,340
- Here you go. - Thanks.

119
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,040
So, you really don't remember anything?

120
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,040
No, I don't remember anything at all.

121
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,880
But you were called Ryo-san, right?

122
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,440
Probably.

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
I wonder what it is.

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,840
This kid suddenly started to use the service.

125
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,240
I was told to fix it a little, so I'm a good boy.

126
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,680
I see.

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
Because it's a big difference from your brother.

128
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,860
But why did you fix it?

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Maybe he's an electrician.

130
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,820
Well, I don't know myself, but my hands move on their own.

131
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,820
What?

132
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:51,900
What?

133
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,740
Ryo-san hasn't come today?

134
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,480
No, he hasn't returned to Ryo's side either.

135
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,440
It's always Zuru Yasumi, but I can't contact him at all.

136
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,520
He's a bad guy.

137
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,280
If this happens, I'll consult with the director and fire him for his job.

138
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,320
But I wonder what really happened.

139
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,620
I hope nothing happens.

140
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,680
Just leave it.

141
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,360
I don't know where he is and what's going on.

142
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm going to go.

143
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,320
Bye.

144
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,520
See you later.

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,380
You've been waiting, Ryo-san.

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,240
Ah.

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,180
Let's go home then.

148
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,100
I have to take care of him.

150
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,140
Don't worry about it.

151
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,060
If you want, I'll help you too.

152
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm happy to help you, but...

153
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm also happy that you're helping me on your ship.

154
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
Don't you have your own ship?

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,360
You don't have a boat?

156
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,480
I have one, but...

157
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,960
Hm?

158
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,920
It's this one.

159
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,340
I've been using it since my dad's generation.

160
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,940
I don't have to buy a new boat or spend money on it.

161
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,420
Can I borrow some tools?

162
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,100
Huh?

163
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,140
Yeah.

164
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,400
Can you repair a boat?

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,460
I don't know.

166
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,280
I don't know, but I feel like I can do something.

167
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Maybe you were a carpenter or something.

168
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,860
Yeah.

169
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,940
I always feel like I'm making something smaller.

170
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,440
I don't know what I'm doing.

171
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,820
Hm.

172
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,820
Hm.

173
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,060
Hm.

174
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,300
Hm.

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,380
Hm.

176
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,600
Wow.

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,720
You can even repair a boat.

178
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,680
Yeah.

179
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,360
You call me "Big Boss" from now on.

180
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,060
Huh?

181
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
Please, Big Boss.

182
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
You're kind of embarrassing.

183
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,580
It's all right.

184
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,460
Yo, Big Boss!

185
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,680
Nippon Ichi!

186
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,580
A game of tug of war!

187
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,380
Don't mess with me.

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,900
My face and body can't stop moving.

189
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,320
I don't need to go on a black and white journey at night.

190
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:46,240
I've inherited the power of drift and versatility.

191
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,280
The

192
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,660
Well, it's a lot.

193
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,840
My father would be happy to see it.

194
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,660
Does your father not board the ship anymore?

195
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,620
Since I got my back hurt.

196
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm working at a pachinko shop in front of the station now.

197
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,380
My father actually wants to board the ship.

198
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,140
Ryo!

199
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,300
How was it today?

200
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,420
Oh, it's a lot!

201
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,500
I see, it's a lot.

202
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,520
Ryo, thank you for everything.

203
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,980
Ryo.

204
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,960
Yes.

205
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,340
No, no.

206
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,660
Let's drink this.

207
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,040
Good, good.

208
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,420
Thank you.

209
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,520
You're a good drinker.

210
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,700
Let's go.

211
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,220
Dad.

212
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm happy, too.

213
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,460
Shut up, Ryo.

214
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,900
Ryo.

215
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,440
Here, Ryo.

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes.

217
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,180
By the way, Ryo.

218
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,840
I need to talk to you about something.

219
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,420
Can you stay here for a while?

220
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm serious, Ryo.

221
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,560
I don't mind if you stay here forever.

222
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,040
Please do that, Anki.

223
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,900
I'm grateful for that, but...

224
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,520
I...

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
That's right.

226
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,320
Ryo, can you be my maid?

227
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,160
What?

228
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,440
Maid?

229
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,220
Yes.

230
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,800
I'd be happy if you could be my maid.

231
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,080
What?

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,960
Hey, Aya.

233
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,420
I'm Ryo, right?

234
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,260
You're not a maid, are you?

235
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,720
You're an idiot!

236
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,140
Who is he?

237
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm telling you, he's an idiot!

238
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,060
What?

239
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
He's an idiot.

240
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,920
Don't call me an idiot!

241
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,900
Stop talking about me.

242
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,560
It's been a month since we talked.

243
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,940
Have you got any news from Ryo?

244
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,360
No.

245
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,800
I left the store because he said he'd be back soon.

246
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,280
But it's been a month.

247
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,480
Forget about him.

248
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,860
That guy.

249
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,360
If he's not here, there will be no problem.

250
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,920
We can go home in peace.

251
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,000
Um, sir?

252
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,740
What?

253
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,280
The file is upside down.

254
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,960
So, we came to Hakodate's Uojishiba.

255
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,620
What's up, Terai?

256
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, that...

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,360
Hm?

258
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,900
This program is...

259
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,000
This is Tsukamoto Tetsuya.

260
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,340
The person in the corner on the left.

261
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,960
Nice to meet you.

262
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, Ryo-chan!

263
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,280
What's with Hakodate?

264
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
①Leave the

265
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,900
Sayonara!

266
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,460
Hey, sister!

267
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,820
Why don't you go somewhere nice with us?

268
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,200
We have little time, we are in a dilemma.

269
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,060
Why don't you play with us?

270
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,480
No!

271
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,280
Don't say such nonsense.

272
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,820
Hey!

273
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,400
- Hey! - No!

274
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
- Hey, stop it! - I said no!

275
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
Who's there?!

276
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,440
Ryo-san!

277
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Who the hell are you?

278
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,060
Don't get in my way!

279
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,540
You're disgusting!

280
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,800
You're a big man, and you're with two guys!

281
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,680
Shut up! Don't try to act cool, you bastard!

282
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,980
Get down.

283
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
You bastard!

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,240
I did it!

285
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,920
You're a big man, you bastard!

286
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Are you hurt?

287
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,760
I'm fine.

288
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,720
I see.

289
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,020
Ryo-san!

290
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,160
What's wrong?

291
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,580
I was scared.

292
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,480
I almost missed you.

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,160
Ryo-san, do the memories not return?

294
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,680
They don't.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,240
If they do,

296
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,000
what?

297
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,860
If they do,

298
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,460
do you want to go somewhere?

299
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,820
Brother said

300
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,440
that he'd be able to buy another ship thanks to you.

301
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,220
He'd be able to work for you anytime.

302
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,840
Ryo...

303
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,320
Don't go anywhere! Stay here forever!

304
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
Aya...

305
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,360
I...

306
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,280
I've been thinking about you...

307
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
Aya!

308
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,120
Wait, wait...

309
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,500
Ryo, go home first.

310
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,060
Yeah.

311
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,100
Hey!

312
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,720
You came to see Ryo?

313
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah, she was a pretty girl.

314
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,100
A girl...

315
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
From what I saw, she looked like a woman who came to find her ex-boyfriend.

316
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,160
See you later.

317
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,860
Excuse me.

318
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,580
Yeah?

319
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,960
I'd like to ask you something.

320
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,840
I'm looking for this person.

321
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,400
Do you have any idea about him?

322
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,460
What is this person?

323
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,820
His name is Ryo Tsukankichi.

324
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,680
Your husband?

325
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,700
No, actually, I...

326
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,420
Did this person do something?

327
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,480
Well, a little...

328
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,540
So, do you remember anything?

329
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,880
No, I've never seen him before.

330
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,840
I see.

331
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,480
......

332
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,940
...

333
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,000
Aniki!

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,080
Big brother!

335
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,120
Big brother, that's...

336
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,440
Yes, it's mine.

337
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,540
It seems I'm being chased by the police.

338
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
If I stay here, I'll be a nuisance to everyone.

339
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,540
I want to disappear from here.

340
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,260
Big brother...

341
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,380
A policeman is looking for you at the port.

342
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,580
I see.

343
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,400
Run away, big brother!

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,040
Ryoji, you...

345
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,620
I don't care if you're being chased by the police.

346
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm a big brother!

347
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,040
Hurry up!

348
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,960
Ryo!

349
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,760
He's leaving.

350
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,460
See you later.

351
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,100
Ryo!

352
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,500
I finally found you.

353
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,800
Who are you?

354
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,560
What are you talking about?

355
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,760
I've been looking for you.

356
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,980
You've been looking for me?

357
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,980
That's right.

358
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,420
Who are you?

359
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,380
Big brother, don't be fooled.

360
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,560
He's a policeman.

361
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,700
A policeman?

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,960
What are you talking about?

363
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,420
Come with me.

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
I won't let you go from here.

365
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,860
What are you?

366
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,880
Move!

367
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,500
What are you doing?

368
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,180
Big brother, now!

369
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm sorry, Ryoji.

370
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm sorry, but...

371
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,780
Be careful.

372
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,760
He's an old man, isn't he?

373
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,220
Ryoji!

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,100
Can't you understand?

375
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,060
I don't want to be aå

376
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,880
I'm sorry, but...

377
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,260
You can learn very good Japanese.

378
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,320
He says this is bad.

379
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,180
What the hell is he talking about?

380
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,240
Master, I'm going to show my brother a joke.

381
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,340
Kei?

382
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Senpai, stop!

383
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,840
W-what?!

384
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,720
Run away!

385
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,240
Senior, why!

386
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,640
Move to the ship infront of you!

387
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,700
Ryo, please stop!

388
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
Super Duran

389
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,400
What?!

390
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,460
What have I done?

391
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,840
I see!

392
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,240
Yes, that's right.

393
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,540
That's true.

394
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,820
It is said that if you pay a lot of money to the shop, you will be fined.

395
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,420
If there is a chance that you will get a lot of money, you will be sued.

396
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,960
What?

397
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,840
This year, the price of crab water is low and the price is rising.

398
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,340
This is it!

399
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,800
If you take the crab and sell it, you will get a lot of money quickly.

400
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,960
I went to the crab market after the fishing boat chartered, but there was a big storm.

401
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,700
I was thrown into the sea and was in the port town when I realized it.

402
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,080
That's right, I didn't let go of my sword, so I didn't let go of my sword.

403
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,360
I see.

404
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,040
I remembered everything.

405
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,380
That's good.

406
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,400
What?

407
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,840
Not good at all.

408
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,720
After all, I couldn't get the crab, so I can't pay you back, and it would be a big deal if the director found out about this.

409
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,560
No good.

410
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:19,940
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,640
It's definitely bad.

412
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,080
What should I do?

413
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,800
He went, Ryo-san.

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah.

415
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,600
Ryo-san lost his memory?

416
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah.

417
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,960
According to Reiko-kun's report, it seems so.

418
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,500
So he didn't contact me for a month.

419
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm back.

420
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,840
Ryo-san!

421
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,640
Ryo-san!

422
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,200
Who are you?

423
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,480
Do you really have a memory loss?

424
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,860
Don't you know me?

425
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,600
I can't remember.

427
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,020
I can't remember.

428
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:23,220
If you can't remember where you went without telling me that you were going to the crab farm, I have a request form for the fishing boat.

429
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,380
Do you really not remember?

430
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,300
Well.

431
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,320
Ryo-san.

432
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,280
I can't remember at all.

434
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,700
I see.

435
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,900
Ryo-san.

436
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,060
Ryo-san.

437
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,360
It seems I have caused you great trouble here.

438
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
I will leave this town.

439
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,880
What?

440
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,080
I don't want to cause you any trouble anymore.

441
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,300
Please let me go this way.

442
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,620
Wait, Ryo-tsu.

443
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,540
It's not trouble.

444
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,580
You are the necessary person for the fishing boat.

445
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,760
That's right.

446
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,460
Don't go, Ryo-san.

447
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,780
Yeah.

448
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,860
I feel lonely without Ryou.

449
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,980
Senpai!

450
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,960
You all are so...

451
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,920
Then, I...

452
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,700
Can I stay here?

453
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
Of course.

454
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,300
Thank you, Chief!

455
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,020
Chief Ohara is such a great person!

456
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,440
Chief Ohara?

457
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,600
Why do you know my name?

458
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,200
Huh? Why do I know it?

459
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,840
I can't remember.

460
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:36,800
Ryou!

461
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,720
Your memory loss was a lie from the beginning, wasn't it?

462
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,340
No! It was true at first.

463
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,460
But I finally remembered it.

464
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,400
Oh, so that's how it is.

465
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,180
I will never forgive you!

466
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,920
Hey, Ryou!

467
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,980
When I remember, it's like this again!

468
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,180
Yes.

469
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,800
Hello!

470
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,560
Welcome!

471
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,220
Welcome!

472
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,160
Welcome!

473
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,660
Welcome!

474
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,700
Welcome here!

475
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,380
Welcome!

476
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,040
Welcome!

477
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,280
Welcome here!

478
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,580
Come Sir!

479
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,220
Welcome!

480
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:22,820
Welcome!

481
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,340
Welcome!

482
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:23,660
Sir!

483
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,260
Oh!

484
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,680
Excuse me!

485
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:24,980
No!

486
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,780
Come Sir!

487
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,200
splendesty, splendesty, splendesty!

488
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,820
Are you the selling type?

489
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,380
I'll do whatever I want.

490
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,560
That's right.

491
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,320
I'm the California Parece.

492
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,040
Can I have a drink?

493
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Oh

494
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,020
California is not for you

495
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,340
This is not America

496
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm sorry, sir

497
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,500
Excuse me, excuse me

498
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,940
Come on in

499
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:46,960
Then

500
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,660
Kushiage, Kakiage, Katsuage

501
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,260
Whatever it is, what is it?

502
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,100
What do you recommend?

503
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,520
Be careful with the Katsuage

504
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,560
Huh?

505
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,380
Is that a gag from my father?

506
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes, I'm sorry

507
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,340
I don't understand

508
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,980
Huh?

509
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,580
Eh?

510
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:05,980
Huh?

511
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,220
Ah, that, that, that, that, that, that

512
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,660
Really?

513
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,440
Yes, welcome

514
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,980
Welcome, please

515
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Yes, welcome

516
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,740
Welcome, please

517
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,140
Yes, welcome

518
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,360
Welcome, please

519
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,940
Yes, welcome

520
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,540
Welcome, please

521
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,660
The captain is on leave

522
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,900
and the Nishiki gui is

523
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,100
The Japanese god who was asked to take care of the child

524
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,800
I thought it was just a small part-time job to feed the child

525
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,380
Koichiro, the leader, who was the most adorable, ran away

526
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,480
Koichiro come back

527
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,820
Hey, if this happens, that's the only way

528
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,260
Next time "Nishiki Goi Panic"

529
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,140
Thank you

530
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,940
Next time "Nishiki Goi Panic"
