00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
Touhou Special Edition

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,320
T-T-When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,080
Make your room brighter and look away

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,580
I looked out at the day

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:29,980
when the flower in my heart bloomed

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,260
I kicked the ground and flew to the pit

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:41,740
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I used to be a jokin

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,500
I was laughed at as a child

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,760
Even if I try to cheer up, I can't help but laugh

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,180
I'm a little bit of a crybaby

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,060
The cityscape is strangely kind

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,860
From the fountain of the Tungari hat

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,320
The sun goes down to the taishakuten

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,080
Tomorrow will end tomorrow

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,740
tomorrow will end tomorrow

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,260
I'm a little bit of a crybaby

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,280
Katsushika, Shibamata

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,160
I lost my happiness

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,100
I realized

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,640
Because I'm a fool

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Master Ryozuma?!

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,900
Get up!

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,740
This can't be helped.

24
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,680
Senpai please wake up!

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,180
Hm? What is it?

26
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,540
It's already past 3 O'clock!

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,920
I slept well.

28
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,520
Let me sleep more.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,240
You'll get angry if you don't go back.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,300
The patrol car is already here.

31
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,420
Okay, let's go.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Senpai!

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,360
I forgot that I was a pirate.

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,440
I forgot that I was a pirate.

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,760
I can't dive when I'm awake.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm out of breath.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,440
That's because you're sleeping in there.

38
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,700
What?

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,720
What's wrong?

40
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,980
I don't have my wallet!

41
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,500
I dropped it in the river!

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
That was a bad luck.

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
I'll find it!

44
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,920
He's acting as if he can't believe it.

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,200
But...

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,860
What's more important, money or health?

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,180
What's more important, money or health?

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,460
What a dirty river!

49
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,200
What's wrong?

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,200
You're all wet!

51
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,980
I fell into the river.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,960
You fell into the river.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,760
You'll jump in again if you drop your wallet.

54
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,940
You'll jump in again if you drop your wallet.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
I'll catch a cold.

56
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,780
I found it in the river.

57
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,620
It was completely black and hard to find.

58
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,720
It was completely black and hard to find.

59
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,500
You didn't even wear your underwater glasses.

60
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,060
You didn't even wear your underwater glasses.

61
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,400
There are so many of them today.

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,120
There were a lot around the dock earlier.

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,420
Senpai, did you do something again?

64
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,120
I don't know!

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,820
I don't know!

66
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,160
It's a big deal.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,580
What's wrong, chief?

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,880
It's a rescue accident.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,140
What's wrong, chief?

70
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,280
Aogeneic products have sprung up at the bridge.

71
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:33,420
Aogeneic products have sprung up at the bridge.

72
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,460
Aeneic products have sprung up at the bridge.

73
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,580
Many of the drugs that had saved them have finally come out on the river.

74
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,680
Many of the drugs that had saved them have finally come out on the river.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,740
Every quarter of the place, it's been flooded with the water.

76
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,620
It's been flooded with the water.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,720
It's been flooded with the water.

78
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,880
Is the bridge near to the�get?

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah. You know it?

80
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,340
There is a water source here. Is there a water source here?

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I was swimming here a moment ago, senpai.

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,420
What!?

83
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,680
Ryotsu, why were you swimming in such a place?

84
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,080
At first I fell, and then I went to look for my wallet on the river.

85
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
Come to think of it, the fish were floating and I thought it was strange.

86
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,880
What the hell.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,940
After that, I was looking for my wallet for about an hour and then I went into the water.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,080
You're greedy.

89
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,420
So, how are you feeling?

90
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,500
Huh? No, I'm not really...

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,700
I mean, when you say that, it makes me feel...

92
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,880
Eh? That's terrible!

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,380
If you don't call an ambulance, senpai!

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,840
Well, I don't think there's anything wrong, Ryotsu-san.

95
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,240
Really?

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,480
Yes. No scabs, no poisoning, no skin damage.

97
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,540
The only thing left is to wait for the results of the test, but it should be fine.

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,240
I see.

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,740
That's good.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Sensei, wait a minute.

101
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,060
Hm?

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,220
I see.

103
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,620
What!?

104
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,760
I see.

105
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,200
Ryotsu-san, please wait as you are.

106
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,940
Yeah.

107
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,660
Huh?

108
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,180
It's the new species' metabolism?

109
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,540
Yeah.

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
I found it after doing the test with Ryotsu Kankichi.

111
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
As you all know,

112
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,600
the biological defense function that keeps people healthy is the most important.

113
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,080
That's why it doesn't get sick.

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,020
Even if a foreign object enters the body, this body will protect the body.

115
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,800
Human bodies are usually shaped in the same way.

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,860
Therefore, Ryotsu's body is shaped like this!

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Unbelievable!

118
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,000
It's like a manga's Pai-kin.

119
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,580
It's like a manga's Pai-kin.

120
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,440
It's still too early to be surprised.

121
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,940
It's a different structure, so I did some research and found some amazing facts.

122
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,000
Look at this video.

123
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,100
When a virus approaches this body, it will explode immediately.

124
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,420
It will kill the virus in no time.

125
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,500
What!?

126
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,440
It has an amazing improvement and repair function!

127
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,800
It's so fast!

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,060
It's terrible!

129
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,580
Usually, the body is made to resist viruses that get in by the wind.

130
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,320
Meanwhile, the symptoms of the wind will continue.

131
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,580
However, in his case, it won't work.

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,160
No matter what virus it is, it won't fight.

133
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,440
That means...

134
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,220
We can get a vaccine that can fight any virus!

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,300
The strongest vaccine in history!

136
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:20,880
Yeah!

137
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,340
Professor, why did you create such a special antibody?

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,380
Hmm...

139
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,960
In my opinion, at first, normal antibodies were produced from the lymph nodes.

140
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,680
However, they were damaged and became the worst environment.

141
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,140
The lymph nodes produced an antibody that could withstand the dirtiness.

142
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,860
And when it was damaged again, a stronger antibody was created.

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,260
And even if it was in a state of hell that would never be restored,

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,380
it was revived many times like a firebird and was created the strongest antibody in history.

145
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a antibody that has risen from the hell of the evil environment.

146
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,520
It's quite strong.

147
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh!

148
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,320
According to his data, he's never taken any preventive measures because he doesn't like injections.

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,540
Nevertheless, he hasn't had any diseases for the past 30 years.

150
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,980
Amazing!

151
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,380
That's too amazing!

152
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,600
It's all because of this antibody.

153
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,120
If a special antibody of the wind is created, it will be a Nobel Prize.

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,140
We must not return him from this hospital.

155
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's all win the Nobel Prize!

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,260
Yes, sir!

157
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,660
Yes, sir!

158
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,300
Yes, sir!

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,300
Yes, sir!

160
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,840
Yes, sir!

161
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,740
Yes, sir!

162
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,720
Please have your meal.

163
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,600
I don't know if you like it or not, but...

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,620
You suddenly became kind.

165
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,580
No, it's not that...

166
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,240
You must be hiding something.

167
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,300
No, it's not like that...

168
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,560
What the hell?

169
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,900
I'm going to do a re-examination because it's very rare to see you return.

171
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,220
Oh, I thought you were going to do something like that.

172
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,360
You should have investigated more!

173
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,660
If you don't have any abnormalities, there's no point.

174
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,340
Let's go home!

175
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,520
I can't go home!

176
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,940
Well, you can.

177
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,440
I want you to help me.

178
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,900
Let's help humanity!

179
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Let's do this!

180
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,760
Who would help us?

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,760
Let go!

182
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,820
Professor!

183
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,320
It's a special antibody of the wind, but...

184
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,860
It's different from the other medicines.

185
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,880
It's a special antibody.

186
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,600
It's an ancient medicine.

187
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,900
If it's true, it's a Nobel Prize.

188
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,560
It's true.

189
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,640
We finally found that vaccine.

190
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,380
Name it...

191
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,720
Ryōtsu G.E.X.

192
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,140
Good job!

193
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,420
Good job!

194
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,160
The mass media is a mess every day.

195
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,140
Yeah, it's a strange discovery.

196
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,640
I wonder what kind of body he has.

197
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,440
He said he ate mud and leaves when he was a child.

198
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,820
He said he ate dog poop to test his courage.

199
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,920
I heard that he walked to Osaka when he was in elementary school.

200
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,740
To Osaka?

201
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,340
He said he ran about 30km a day.

202
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,300
He said he ran about 30km a day.

203
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,660
He's challenging himself to the limit of his strength every day.

204
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,500
Even when he becomes an adult, his ability to act remains the same.

205
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,240
That's why he was able to change his body.

206
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,440
So, from today, this is your room.

207
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,140
This is the most luxurious suite room in this hotel.

208
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,020
It's a great view.

209
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,720
It's a great view.

210
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,760
The suites of the first-class hotels are different.

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,860
But why are you doing this?

212
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
Because you're famous now.

213
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,280
Will the media go to the hospital and bother other patients?

214
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,680
Well, it seems that it's a great thing in the world.

215
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,880
Please don't leave this room.

216
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,360
It's hard to get in touch with anyone other than the person we allow.

217
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,580
You're pretty strict because you just won the Nobel Prize.

218
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,080
Don't be stupid.

219
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,320
Don't be stupid.

220
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,420
You're saving humanity.

221
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,440
I got it.

222
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,860
I got it.

223
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,420
Anyway, it's boring to just watch TV and videos.

224
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,060
Please prepare a table, a TV game, and a pachinko table.

225
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,600
If you don't like it, I'll go to another hospital.

226
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,080
I can't do that.

227
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,800
You, prepare it right away.

228
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,100
Yes, sir.

229
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,320
And...

230
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,520
Are you still here?

231
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,420
I'll take care of the most beautiful nurse in this hospital.

232
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,200
No way.

233
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,000
If you don't like it, I'll...

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,220
I'll...

235
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,000
I got it.

236
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,260
This has become a great deal of pleasure.

237
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,620
The End

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,160
Hmm...

239
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,700
That's it.

240
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,360
Hi...

241
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,040
Hello?

242
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,680
My name iselle.

243
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,980
And I'm a doctor.

244
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,840
Is it good?

245
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,520
It's the best.

246
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,980
The two of you served us the food and it's very good.

247
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,960
But I'm tired of this hotel's suite room.

248
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,300
From tomorrow, we'll have another hotel's deluxe suite.

249
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,900
It'll be a room that will cost 500,000 yen per night.

250
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,320
Y-yes, I'll tell the professor.

251
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,140
Ryotsu-sama, we have a visit from the Kazushika office.

252
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,980
Let me in.

253
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,880
Yo, Ryotsu. How are you?

254
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,480
Thanks to you, the office has become famous.

255
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,000
When you call me, call me "sensei".

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,560
What?

257
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,540
If you don't like it, I won't help you.

258
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,540
Please be careful, sensei!

259
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Sensei?

260
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,740
What are you talking about?

261
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,580
The future of humanity is at stake!

262
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,980
R-Ryotsu-sensei, we have a report from the capital that you have been promoted to the 4th class.

263
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,860
4th class?

264
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,240
The 4th class?

265
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,740
The 4th class?

266
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,620
That means you're the chief of the police, so you're the chief of the police, the police officer, the police officer, and the detective.

267
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,860
I'm the chief of the police since the police started.

268
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,860
What's your class, director?

269
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,680
I-I'm the detective.

270
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,760
Hmm, then I'd like to be the detective.

271
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,060
You-you're so arrogant!

272
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,540
I-I-I'm the chief of the police.

273
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,500
But...

274
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,480
If you make us angry, we won't be able to get away with it.

275
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,300
You're being arrogant.

276
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,140
I understand, sensei. I'll go to the capital and think about it.

277
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,480
Of course. Thanks to me, the Earth will be completely destroyed.

278
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,700
I'm going to save the Earth.

279
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
Then, with this...

280
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,060
Wait a minute.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
Is there still something I need to do?

282
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,480
When you go home, you have to say, "Sensei, I'm sorry."

283
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
Or else I'll be in a bad mood.

284
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,680
If you're going to make that face, it's fine. I won't help you.

285
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,780
I'll say it.

286
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,360
"Sensei, I'm sorry."

287
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
That's a good feeling.

288
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,620
Both of you are following the pattern.

289
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,180
Well, it can't be helped. He's the savior of humanity.

290
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm not surprised that he's the savior.

291
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm ticklish.

292
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,540
I'm dying.

293
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,780
Th-this is...

294
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,380
Professor!

295
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,460
Professor!

296
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,400
Wh-wh-what?

297
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,260
What?

298
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,120
Are you sure?

299
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,300
You're going to destroy even the cancer cells?

300
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,800
Cancer is stupid.

301
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,160
From a water bug to a night-dying bug to a liver bug, everything has an effect.

302
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,960
The Ryotsu GPX is invincible.

303
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,180
This is the greatest discovery in the century.

304
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,760
No one can deprive us of such awness.

305
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,460
I can't believe I can live in such a expensive room.

306
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,600
Uh, that's...

307
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,080
I can give you all the dinner services.

308
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,940
Buy some wine for Bulbul.

309
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes.

310
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,280
Huh?

311
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,760
Hahaha.

312
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,820
It was too strong for you, Bulbul.

313
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,860
Here you go.

314
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,880
Don, the third one.

315
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,940
What?

316
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,760
Another 100,000 yen?

317
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,020
I'm a parent, so it's 48,000 yen.

318
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,500
Here you go. The rest is on me.

319
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,480
Maria is the only one who won.

320
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,400
I feel something really strange.

321
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,320
Of course.

322
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,980
Why would a girl of this color do something like this

323
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,380
That's because it's about human dreams and the future.

324
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,560
What does that have to do with this colorful uniform?

325
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,060
It hurts!

326
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,760
Hey, what's wrong? Get a hold of yourself!

327
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,400
I just took a nap.

328
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,780
Who are you?

329
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm not suspicious.

330
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,120
I came to pick up Mr. Adiaz on a request from the Russian government.

331
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
The Russian government?

332
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,080
I want to develop the Ryoto GPX in Russia.

333
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,940
I've prepared a 100,000,000 yen coin.

334
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,160
100,000,000 yen?

335
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,900
I want you to come to Russia with me.

336
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll give you 200,000,000 yen in the UK.

337
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
And it's cash.

338
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,760
I think I'll go to the UK.

339
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,140
Wait a minute.

340
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
I've prepared 500,000,000 yen in France.

341
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
All right, let's go to France.

342
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,300
I'll give you the same conditions.

343
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,020
I'll give you a 500,000,000 yen-only villa.

344
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,480
Then France...

345
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,260
A 1,000-yen villa.

346
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
If you can, I'll be your maid.

347
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,240
How about it?

348
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,680
As expected, you won the World Cup and you're ready.

349
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,500
You're the best. I'll go to France.

350
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,660
Lord Ryo, you can't!

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,700
Oh yeah, you should go with Maria.

352
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,800
What? I can come too?

353
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,840
If you have 5 billion in your villa, you'll be able to live a happy life.

354
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,940
I'll go with Lord Ryo.

355
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,420
We'll go too.

356
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,380
There's no other way.

357
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay, we've decided.

358
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Okay, the helicopter is waiting.

359
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,560
Oh, that's the one!

360
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,960
Here I go!

361
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,660
Who did this?

362
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,660
This music is...

363
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,520
So it's you, Captain Bakuryuu!

364
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,040
It's been a while, Mr. Ryo.

365
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,540
You're here.

366
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm here to see you on behalf of the US government.

367
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,640
Come with me.

368
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,440
I'm a very popular guy.

369
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,240
I have 5 billion in my villa.

370
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,000
What's your condition?

371
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm strong!

372
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,540
You idiot!

373
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,900
You don't have such a condition!

374
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,540
You can't run away.

375
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,600
You don't deserve to win!

376
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,300
You won't beat me!

377
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,560
Ai-

378
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:12,960
Ai-

379
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,340
Ai-

380
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
The helicopter fell on the US military.

381
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,520
Please prepare another method to transport us from now on.

382
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,660
There's no point.

383
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,400
Captain Bakuryuu, you're notNew.

384
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,720
What?

385
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,700
He's here!

386
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:24,780
Stop!

387
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
How persistent!

388
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,180
I told you not to underestimate Captain Bakuryu!

389
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,740
Looks like it's gone. We'll just keep going.

390
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,260
Red light!

391
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,520
Shingo!

392
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,860
Oh no!

393
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,780
Oh no! We found it!

394
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,240
I think I'll be the only one who can escape.

395
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,880
Let's meet up in the lobby of Paradise Hospital.

396
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,580
Okay.

397
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Ryotsu is not to be seen!

398
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,560
What?

399
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,520
It's that intersection!

400
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,020
Damn it! They're already here.

401
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,880
I'll take care of it!

402
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,760
Hey!

403
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,160
I found you, Ryotsu!

404
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,860
Come with me to America!

405
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,300
No way!

406
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,320
Captain Bakuryu!

407
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,240
Come with me!

408
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,580
If you do this, I'll beat you to death!

409
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,920
Ryotsu, you're ten years too early to run away from me!

410
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,320
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

411
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,660
Wait!

412
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,000
Hey! Are you going up here?

413
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,700
I want to go in!

414
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,580
Huh?

415
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,380
No way!

416
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,620
How did you get in the subway?

417
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,740
Don't say trite things like the subway manzai of the third class.

418
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
Don't you know that there is a vehicle entry?

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,160
Stop!

420
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,140
Come to America!

421
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,800
Damn it!

422
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,380
Ah, so this is it!

423
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,500
This is it!

424
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,220
It's going to crash!

425
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,520
I did it!

426
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,000
Take that!

427
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,800
Look at that!

428
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,080
Now I'm a French woman with a beauty.

429
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,480
I forgot that I was inside the tunnel.

430
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,400
What's with that commotion?

431
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,960
We gathered here in a hurry to inform you of a sad news.

432
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,160
A sad news?

433
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,260
What is it?

434
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,600
It has been revealed that both GPX vaccines are unusable.

435
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,600
What?

436
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,460
What do you mean?

437
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,520
No way!

438
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,020
They are too powerful.

439
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,500
They are like a

440
00:22:50,500 --> 00:23:04,780
I was trapped in the antibodies and I couldn't calculate his out-of-the-way body.

441
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,740
So, it's not useful at all?

442
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,440
That's what I mean.

443
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,000
What?

444
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,500
I can't be with him.

445
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,800
What?

446
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,120
The 5th grade special education?

447
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,220
Of course not.

448
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,140
I've lost my mind.

449
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,980
The principal is thinking about dropping the 5th grade.

450
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,340
No way!

451
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,960
And your desk will be that from today.

452
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,880
What?

453
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,020
No way!

454
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,760
They've been cutting down my budget for you.

455
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,560
Use that desk for about two years.

456
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,420
I'm cold.

457
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,540
I might catch a cold because of my weak body.

458
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,240
No, you definitely can't catch a cold.

459
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,280
There is a strongest antibody in the world.

460
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,260
Chapter One: The Disaster of the Butterfly

461
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,040
Chapter Two: The Disaster of the Butterfly

462
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,900
If everyone comes together here

463
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,320
It's like a dream, the last energy

464
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Looking at tomorrow, believing in yesterday

465
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,420
Drawing the universe, if you stand on the ground

466
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,740
The planet with the turtle draws a circle

467
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,260
Drawing the circle

468
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,360
Isn't that good?

469
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
There's no reason to say that!

470
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,960
Senpai!

471
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,000
What's wrong, Honda?

472
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,980
Is it a big deal that your father and brother don't give you a job?

473
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,240
You give it to me!

474
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,440
I see, but that's not true!

475
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,560
What's wrong?

476
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,580
My family is a little different!

477
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,780
Next time on Honda Family!

478
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,220
Thanks for watching!
