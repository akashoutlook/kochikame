Engsub by Kay Salmon

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,360
It's time to watch TV

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,260
Keep your head up and keep an eye on yourself

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:28,920
On a hot sun,boarding on a river

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,860
When I kicked the stone, it flew to my shoes

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,840
I wonder if I'm going to go to the gym that I used to play

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,300
I laughed at the fact that I was still a child

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,880
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm always a shy little turtle

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,400
Even my yawns don't change

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape is strangely kind

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,680
From the fountain of a pointed hat

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,100
The sun sets to the sea

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,560
Tomorrow

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,820
It's over like this

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,900
I lost my happiness

17
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,080
I realized

18
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm such a fool

19
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,220
Good morning

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,680
Good morning

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,860
I see. Today is the day

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,420
We have to clean your house

23
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,900
That's right

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,800
I saw she's coming

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,840
She went somewhere

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,340
Just what a trifle

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,380
If you come home, you'll be in a bad situation

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,060
Hey, let's start cleaning

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,200
I'll help you

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,700
Okay

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,020
Are you OK, Terai-san

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm fine.

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,660
This is...

34
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,620
It looks like an old photo.

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,440
This is the history of the exit in front of the park.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,660
This is a photo of the police officers who worked here.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,580
This is the photo of the first time I came here.

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,900
Young man! The chief had such an era.

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,280
Of course. I can't suddenly become the chief.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,440
By the way, this is the chief Iwata who was in charge of this place at that time.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,400
He was a kind and honest man. He was like a police officer's mirror.

42
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,380
Oh!

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,240
Oh!

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,960
I think there's only one person who does such stupid things.

45
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,420
Is it Ryo?

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,420
He came to this exit because he was a graduate.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,600
Actually, I met Ryo-tsu the day before the deployment.

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,700
Really?

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,540
He was drunk in the Han River.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,820
There was a report that the police were in a big trouble.

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,920
Hey! Be quiet!

52
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,620
The police are scared, so they can't drink.

53
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,400
What?

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,380
Cool your head down for a night!

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,120
That was Ryo-tsu.

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,760
What?

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,780
The chief knew that he was a police officer who was assigned to the exit in front of the park,

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,700
so he made me go to pick him up.

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Oh, thank you for coming!

60
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,800
What's the big story?

61
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,120
Well, well, calm down.

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,380
It's an old story.

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:02,700
Besides, I was supposed to be an educator for Ryo-tsu, but when I went on patrol with him...

64
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,240
Hmm? Oh!

65
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,680
He'll be gone for sure.

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,120
Hehehe, a lot, a lot.

67
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,540
Hey, Ryo-tsu!

68
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,820
Or...

69
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,580
Ron!

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,940
I did it!

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,020
Hey, Ryo-tsu!

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,480
Or...

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,180
All right!

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,960
3-5! 3-5! Go! Go!

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,320
Hey, Ryo-tsu!

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:26,640
Ugh!

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,700
I was supposed to be fired, of course.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,820
But Chief Iwata...

79
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,320
He's still young.

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,140
Those who educate people shouldn't get up so soon.

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Oh...

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,460
Come on, come on!

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,980
Huh?

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,400
I went on patrol with him to keep him from running away.

85
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,300
Ouch!

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm not used to wearing shoes, so it hurts.

87
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,680
Hmm...

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,640
Thank you very much.

89
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,580
I bought him sandals with my money.

90
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,480
The sandals he's wearing now are from that time.

91
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,780
Since long ago?

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,800
He's so young!

93
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,660
Senpai has always been a senpai.

94
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,180
He's a senpai, I see.

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,520
Hey!

96
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,300
Hey, Ryo-san!

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,760
You're not dressed up!

98
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,020
That's unusual.

99
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,160
Oh, this is a photograph Ryo-tsu took when he was assigned to the police department.

100
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,060
The police department?

101
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,580
Senpai, were you a cop?

102
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,220
Yeah.

103
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,260
It's been a while.

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,380
Wow, I've never heard of it.

105
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,500
He has his own memories he can't say in words, too.

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,520
I have two.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
It's decided.

108
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
Ryotsu, what have you been doing?

109
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,400
Eh? Senpai, haven't you been watching "Yuuhi ni Hoyoro"?

110
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
I only watch TV news and historical dramas.

111
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,460
It's such an interesting program, but it's a waste.

112
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,220
Senpai, how can I become a detective?

113
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,300
Eh?

114
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,420
I want to become a detective since I joined the police.

115
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,480
Are you a detective?

116
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,420
You can't be a detective if you don't work for the police.

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,940
I'm not good at working for the police.

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,140
I don't do anything big, and I have to wear a cool uniform.

119
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,160
It's better that you don't do anything big.

120
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,840
That's right.

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,300
If I catch ten people,

122
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,980
I'll be a detective.

123
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,860
I might get a call from the police.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
Well, I don't think I can.

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
I see.

126
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,660
Wait!

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,440
You thief!

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,140
Damn it, let me go!

129
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,360
I'll let you go even if you die!

130
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,640
One down!

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,880
One down!

132
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll arrest you!

133
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,240
Huh?

134
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,860
You're going to be a detective?

135
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm certain the chief prosecutor will.

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,880
But he's short of time, short of speed, and short of cells.

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,980
And he's pretty strong, if you think about it.

138
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,040
That's what he said.

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
We're going to have a blast in the name of him.

140
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:27,780
What a jerk.

141
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:37,000
So this is my battlefield from today.

142
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,380
Boss, I'm coming in!

143
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,180
What are you?

144
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm Ryo-tsu. Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,260
I've become a detective since today.

146
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,620
Ryo-tsu?

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,940
You're right.

148
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,200
Hey, everyone.

149
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm Ryo-tsu, the one who's been assigned to this department.

150
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,880
Please call me "Jeans."

151
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,620
What's wrong with you?

152
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,140
Are you a half?

153
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,460
That's my nickname.

154
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,480
Normally, a detective would call me by my nickname.

155
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
No, that's not what I meant.

156
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,820
Oh, then please do that from now on.

157
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,600
By the way, I'm going to wear jeans every day from now on.

158
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,200
So, "Jeans Decker!"

159
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,000
The jeans are...

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
Hey, someone lend me your pants.

161
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,840
What's wrong with you?

162
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,680
What's with that "dabu dabu"?

163
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,460
These pants are too big.

164
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
You don't have to laugh so much.

165
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,120
Just call me Ryo-tsu.

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,260
Don't get so angry.

167
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,360
Nanbu.

168
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,120
Yes.

169
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,240
I'll leave the rest to you.

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm Nanbu, who will be your partner.

171
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,060
Nice to meet you, Deca-pan-Deka.

172
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm Ryo-tsu.

173
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,780
"Ryo-tsu"

174
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,940
"Ryo-tsu"

175
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,880
"Ryo-tsu"

176
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:54,940
"Ryo-tsu"

177
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,060
"Ryo-tsu"

178
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,300
"Mam tombu"

179
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,340
"Mam tombu"

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,340
What the hell?

181
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,640
In addition, you're a detective on a vitality test.

182
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,380
And I'll call you "Ryo-tsu,"

183
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,540
that's all.

184
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,720
No, it's not that.

185
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,600
You're not qualified to do so.

186
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,280
Anyway, why didn't you tell me I could get you a " Assembly? " No,

187
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,060
You did great! The last part of the G-Pan was amazing!

188
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,720
What's this?!

189
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,580
Shh!

190
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,460
What are you doing, Nanbu-san?

191
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:29,980
Shh!

192
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,080
Look at that.

193
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,620
Huh?

194
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,360
A kiss?

195
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,660
Both.

196
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,300
Let's go.

197
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes!

198
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,660
Hey!

199
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
What are you doing?

200
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,800
Oh no!

201
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,900
Ryosu, go that way!

202
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,440
Run away!

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
You!

204
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,860
Ryosu!

205
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back!

206
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,280
Alright, Ryosu. It's over.

207
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,860
Yes!

208
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,320
Hey, hey. What's with the way you're running?

209
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,800
Huh? I'm running properly.

210
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,340
Huh?

211
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,960
Hey, Ohara-kun. You did great.

212
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,100
Huh?

213
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,860
Ryosu.

214
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,600
What are you doing here?

215
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,180
I was just following the investigation.

216
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,160
Oh!

217
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey, hey. Did you know?

218
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,760
I was the one who caught Kaito.

219
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,820
It seems so.

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,080
The day I became a detective, you arrested the culprit.

221
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,640
It means I was really looking for a detective.

222
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,880
Well, Ohara-kun.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,720
You'll be our detective's hand and foot.

224
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,900
Work for me.

225
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,220
Now, let's get out of here.

226
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,700
That idiot is really getting in my way.

227
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,160
What's going on?

228
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,720
Well, ohara-kun.

229
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,340
I'm sorry, Ryosu.

230
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,720
Hey, Ryosu.

231
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,540
I'm listening.

232
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,400
Again?

233
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Let's do a investigation once in a while.

234
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,880
What if we catch the culprit we're following?

235
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,220
Let's go.

236
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,340
Okay, let's go.

237
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,540
Mr. Namu, there's no more criminals around here.

238
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,360
It's no use doing this for days.

239
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,400
But what if we give up and the criminal shows up?

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,040
But...

241
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,560
If it's a criminal drama, we'll find a clue soon.

242
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,160
Is that so?

243
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,220
Yes, yes.

244
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,480
I understand.

245
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,760
Then...

246
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,540
What's wrong?

247
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,580
It seems that the planet we were chasing was caught in Kyushu.

248
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,820
What?

249
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,920
Then everything we've done...

250
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,780
It's all in vain.

251
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,520
Don't be so angry.

252
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,780
It happens often.

253
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,420
Anyway, it's time for the next job.

254
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,720
Cheer up.

255
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,740
Yes.

256
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,820
Mr. Namu.

257
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,440
How long have you been dressed like this?

258
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,380
Until I understand the movements of the Otaguro group.

259
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,920
Recently, the movement of the gang has become active.

260
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,420
There may be some kind of big deal.

261
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
But if there's nothing...

262
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,980
In that case, it's a good thing.

263
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,820
Hmm...

264
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,840
I don't want to be seen by a friend who knows me like this.

265
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,260
What?

266
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,480
What?

267
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,760
A friend?

268
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,960
He's a senior at the station.

269
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,720
Grandpa, are you here for the sunbathing again today?

270
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,580
Yes, this is Mr. Omawari.

271
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,840
The weather is good today.

272
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,400
Yes, it is.

273
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,740
Ryotsu, Japan is said to be a country with few crimes.

274
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,440
Do you know why?

275
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,200
Huh?

276
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
Hmm...

277
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,820
I don't know.

278
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,100
That's because there are police stations all over the city.

279
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,780
That's why the police patrols.

280
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,540
Oh...

281
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:06,820
What?

282
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,760
What happened?

283
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,380
It's a bigger mountain than I expected.

284
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,140
Huh?

285
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,700
The leader of the Otaguro group, who was on the run abroad, has returned.

286
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,800
He was sentenced to death for gambling and murder.

287
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,780
What?

288
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,800
Let's go.

289
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,340
We're on the back door.

290
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:22,720
Yes.

291
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,000
Finally, it's becoming like a detective.

292
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
I'm counting on you, Ryotsu.

293
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,240
Leave it to me.

294
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,980
Who are you?

295
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,840
You're still there.

296
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,380
Mr. Omawari, this way.

297
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,340
Don't run away, Otaguro.

298
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,320
Hey, Otaguro!

299
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,400
Mr. Omawari!

300
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,860
Hey, Otaguro!

301
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,180
Yes!

302
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,820
Stop right there!

303
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,300
Ouch!

304
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,640
Ouch!

305
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,360
Ryotsu?

306
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,320
Huh?

307
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,220
As I thought, it's him.

308
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,420
Yeah, it's true.

309
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,700
What's with that thing?

310
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,500
Didn't you become a policeman?

311
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,560
You became a policeman?

312
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,360
Ah, Otaguro!

313
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,580
Oh no!

314
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,720
Idiot!

315
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,400
You let the criminal escape because you were a junior high school classmate?

316
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,820
How could you make such an excuse?

317
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,560
But, but...

318
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,460
You!

319
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,580
Nanbu, stop it.

320
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,600
Tch! Nanbu, you don't have to hit me.

321
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,260
Ryotsu, you know what Otaguro did, right?

322
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,240
Yeah.

323
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,100
Uh, he killed Tobacco, right?

324
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,820
What Otaguro killed was Nanbu's fiancée.

325
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,880
What?

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,680
But, Nanbu, you didn't say a word about that!

327
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,640
I thought I'd give you extra pressure if I told you.

328
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,720
Nanbu, you're so bright.

329
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,820
I didn't know you had such a past.

330
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
That's what a detective is.

331
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Nanbu.

332
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,280
Yeah?

333
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,680
Oh, it's you.

334
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm sorry!

335
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,800
Huh?

336
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,940
I didn't understand how you felt, and I was just looking at myself.

337
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,240
I... I...

338
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,640
I'm a bad guy!

339
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,800
Don't be like that, Ryotsu.

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,240
Huh?

341
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,660
I cut myself too, so I'm sorry for hitting you.

342
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,880
What? No way!

343
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,600
All right, get a grip.

344
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,400
This time we'll arrest Otaguro together!

345
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,760
Yes, sir!

346
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
Nanbu, I bought it!

347
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,140
Oh, thanks.

348
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,340
Thanks for your hard work.

349
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,700
It's been a week.

350
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,700
I think Otaguro went overseas.

351
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,180
Maybe.

352
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,380
Then, it's no use staying here.

353
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,400
But we'll hide his money.

354
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,000
Before we go abroad, we might come and get it.

355
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,100
Just wait a little longer.

356
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,360
But I want to eat decent food sometimes.

357
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,060
Don't be so naggy.

358
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,840
I'll take you to a drink once this mountain is solved.

359
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,600
Really?

360
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,680
Oh, you're still a minor.

361
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,980
I'll be 20 on March 3rd.

362
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,440
Okay, I promise.

363
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,940
Let's drink until the morning on the third day.

364
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,600
Yay!

365
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,080
It's his car.

366
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,980
Ryotsu, call for support immediately.

367
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,740
Yes!

368
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,820
Ugh...

369
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,220
Ah, shit! I don't have the 10 Yen coin!

370
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,940
Hey, you! Give me the money!

371
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Just give me the money now!

372
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,480
Mr. Omawari! Mr. Omawari!

373
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,740
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

374
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,160
Give me the money!

375
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,480
Hey, Ryotsu! What are you doing?

376
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,480
Senpai, there's a criminal over there.

377
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,040
We have to get the criminal.

378
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,680
But we don't have the 10 Yen coin.

379
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,360
If we don't hurry, he'll run away.

380
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,360
What?

381
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,800
You idiot!

382
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
You can call for support even if you don't have the 10 Yen coin!

383
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,020
Oh, really?

384
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,100
I'll contact the police.

385
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,980
You go back to the scene.

386
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,100
Y-Yes, sir!

387
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,340
Shit...

388
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,700
He's already out.

389
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:52,860
Did he see us?

390
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
Hey, hurry up.

391
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,400
Otaguro!

392
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,820
Yes?

393
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,900
We're not gonna let you get away!

394
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,200
Don't touch that!

395
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,260
Otaguro!

396
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,360
We're gonna arrest you for fraud and murder!

397
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,320
Mr. Nam!

398
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,420
Ryotsu!

399
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,060
Don't let anyone else get away!

400
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,980
What the hell is this?

401
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,220
You bastard!

402
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,460
Namu!

403
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,360
Hurry up!

404
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,340
Namu!

405
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,380
Stay still!

406
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,840
I don't care.

407
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,520
Just follow him.

408
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,020
But...

409
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,980
But the blood is...

410
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,940
If you let him escape,

411
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,280
you'll never catch him again.

412
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,740
But...

413
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,460
But...

414
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,580
You're a detective, too!

415
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,980
We have to catch him.

416
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,240
No matter what.

417
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,600
Let's go!

418
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:47,400
Otaguro!

419
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,700
Get him!

420
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,320
Yes, sir!

421
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,640
Get him!

422
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,300
Get him!

423
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,500
Ouch!

424
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:02,940
Ouch!

425
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,860
Ouch!

426
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,200
Get him!

427
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:11,840
Get him!

428
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,320
Damn it!

429
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,840
You bastard!

430
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,920
Damn it!

431
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,060
Damn it!

432
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,320
You killed Namu!

433
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,640
Damn it!

434
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,480
Damn it!

435
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,500
Damn it!

436
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,160
Damn it!

437
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,820
Senior!

438
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,220
Yotsu!

439
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,520
Where is Namu?

440
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,820
Where is Namu?

441
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,140
Where is Namu?

442
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,340
No way!

443
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
No way!

444
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,260
If only I had called for help earlier...

445
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,500
If only I had called for help earlier...

446
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,400
If only I had called for help earlier...

447
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,820
Is that drama funny?

448
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,180
Is that drama funny?

449
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,860
Cheer up!

450
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,080
Cheer up!

451
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,020
Cheer up!

452
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,500
Let's drink till morning on the third day.

453
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,900
Cheer up!

454
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,520
Cheer up!

455
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
You're a detective, too!

456
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,400
You're a detective, too!

457
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,480
Namu!

458
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,520
Namu!

459
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Namu!

460
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,140
It's been a while since then.

461
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,400
It's been a while since then.

462
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,820
It's been a while since then.

463
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,580
Oh, good morning!

464
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,300
Ryo-tsu, why are you here?

465
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,200
Ryo-tsu, why are you here?

466
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
I didn't know anything.

467
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,080
I didn't know anything.

468
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,400
Please let me work here again.

469
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,360
Please let me work here again.

470
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,980
Ryo-tsu...

471
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,020
Ryo-tsu...

472
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,540
Ryo-tsu...

473
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:10,220
Ryo-tsu...

474
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
That's why he came back here.

475
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,240
That's why he came back here.

476
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,300
Although, he returned to his usual Ryo-tsu soon.

477
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,440
Although, he returned to his usual Ryo-tsu soon.

478
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,180
Ryo-chan also had a hard time.

479
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,160
Ryo-chan also had a hard time.

480
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,280
Then, maybe today...

481
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,060
Then, maybe today...

482
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,200
I see.

483
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,500
It was like this that day, too, Namu.

484
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:35,980
It was like this that day, too, Namu.

485
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm better than him.

486
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,900
You're still a fool.

487
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,840
There is no such thing as Mr. Namu.

488
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,340
There is no such thing as Mr. Namu.

489
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,860
Today, I'll treat you to something.

490
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,940
Let's drink!

491
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,180
Let's drink!

492
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,740
Today, I'll treat you to something.

493
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
Let's drink!
