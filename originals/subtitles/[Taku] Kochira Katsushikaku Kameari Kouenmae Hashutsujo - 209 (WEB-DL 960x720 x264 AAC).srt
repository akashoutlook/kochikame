1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,100
As of now, Takumi is sleeping in front of the TV.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,520
Where Is He Going?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,780
When you watch TV, make the room more bright and stand away from the television.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,240
Come over here, you poor fellow.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,440
You're worried about me, though I'm not around.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm worried about you

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,060
and the white clouds

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,800
I wonder what will happen

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,140
in the meantime

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,540
Come to me if you have no work

12
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,180
I'm worried about you

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:11,460
Look at the red clouds

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,520
and the white clouds

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,120
I wonder what will happen

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,100
in the meantime

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,400
I know, I know, I know

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,300
If you know, just be quiet

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,840
and follow me!

20
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,340
Super Kindergarten Lemon

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:53,220
It's just opened, but it's very popular

22
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,920
Even when it's not lunch time,

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,600
there's a line

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,960
Thank you for the food

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,760
It's our turn

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,060
What are you going to do?

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,500
I just got paid

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,460
It's been a while since I've been luxurious

29
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,140
It's Char Siu noodles

30
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,660
I will do the same

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,320
Two Char Siu noodles, please

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,300
Are you blind?

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,380
What?

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Can't you see the wall?

35
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,020
Wall?

36
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,700
I only do ramen

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
Char Siu noodles are just a neck

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,520
Go away

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,480
What?

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,500
What?

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,780
There's only ramen in the menu

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,580
You're pretty confident about the taste, aren't you?

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,380
Well, I guess so

44
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,320
What kind of taste?

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,980
I'm looking forward to it

46
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,920
Two ramen, please

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,140
Please

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,400
Wait a minute

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,420
We're guests

50
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,000
You should say that you're welcome

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,200
We're not selling service

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
We're selling taste

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,340
If you don't like it, you can leave

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,480
What?

55
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,960
Senpai, we're lined up

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
Please be patient until you eat

57
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
If it's bad, I'll pay for it for free

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,140
If it's bad, I'll pay for it for free

59
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,360
You're going to pay for it

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,220
Hey, you're risking your life for ramen

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,160
I have to do something

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,520
Don't hit me

63
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,160
You're a lame customer like me

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,020
Do you want to go home?

65
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,340
Hey, I'm full of hair

66
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm full of cats

67
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm going to quit the shop

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,500
What?

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,040
I'm going home

70
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,720
Senpai

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,760
Hey, roll the salt

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:44,960
Salt

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,360
This is the last one

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,660
I won't lose

75
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,260
I've worked hard to make it today

76
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,080
I woke up at 5 a.m. for this day

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,400
What?

78
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,140
What's wrong, Komachi?

79
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,660
You don't look good

80
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,500
No,it's nothing like that

81
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sure you didn't make it

82
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,100
No way

83
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,560
The roof is perfect

84
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,480
Ote

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,540
Shatori

86
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,620
Senpai, stop

87
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,380
You're making the ramen today

88
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,620
Thanks to you, I'm in a bad mood. I've been waiting.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,060
Shut on down.

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,080
Let the king escape.

91
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,620
Hey, move.

92
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,940
Why do I have to move?

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
The one who takes this seat wins.

94
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,340
That's a reservation seat.

95
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,280
What? A reservation?

96
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,620
There's no restaurant here, so I'm not going to move.

97
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,400
Sorry for being late.

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,420
Reiko, I was booking this table, but Ryo's staff is in the way.

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,900
Don't call it a day.

100
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,460
We made a hand-made lunch.

101
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,900
Hand-made lunch?

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,460
I'm busy with work these days and can't cook well.

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,320
So we're going to make lunch once a month.

104
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,200
Today is the first time.

105
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,220
We were going to have a feast together.

106
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,480
It's a good idea for you.

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,540
Well, if that's the case, it can't be helped.

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,120
Sorry.

109
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,480
Come on, everyone.

110
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,260
Yes.

111
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,780
Yes.

112
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,900
What's wrong, Matoi?

113
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,960
I forgot.

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,040
What?

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
I said something.

116
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,720
I don't have confidence, so I didn't forget on purpose.

117
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,560
Senior?

118
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,240
Don't say that.

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
As expected of Matoi.

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,140
Mr. Giboshi, a kindergarten teacher is visiting.

121
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,180
A kindergarten teacher?

122
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,680
Matoi, you.

123
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,700
What?

124
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,220
What?

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,560
What?

126
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,040
Are you okay, Senior?

127
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,860
Are you okay, Senior?

128
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm okay, too.

129
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,800
Lemon!

130
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,380
Lemon!

131
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,500
Lemon!

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,600
Lemon!

133
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
Matoi, do you know him?

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
He's my sister's lemon.

135
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,520
He's my sister?

136
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,400
Cute.

137
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
What's wrong, Lemon?

138
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,700
Oh, he came to deliver lunch.

139
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,260
Thank you, Lemon.

140
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,220
What's with that small thing?

141
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,620
It's my sister.

142
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,620
You didn't know?

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,280
No, I didn't say anything when I was training at Gepard.

144
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,760
No, I didn't say anything when I was training at Gepard.

145
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,760
Oh, he was studying abroad in France at that time.

146
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,780
What?

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,780
Studying abroad at this age?

148
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,940
Lemon is a taste genius.

149
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,200
He's a ten-year, no, a hundred-year-old taste owner.

150
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
That's amazing.

151
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,180
He was studying abroad to make her eat French food at Mito's restaurant.

152
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,440
What?

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,860
He went to France just for that?

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,460
What?

155
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,440
What's he thinking?

156
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,240
Is he the worst Ryotsu Kankichi in the Ryotsu family you were talking about?

157
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,720
What?

158
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,960
Amazing.

159
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,080
He's not just a taste, but he's a genius at looking at people.

160
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,820
Shut up!

161
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,340
His face and way of speaking are vulgar.

162
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,680
Don't bother me.

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,340
How do you know how to use your mouth?

164
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,280
Is it the way of Gepard?

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,340
Do you think kindergarten children know my good points?

166
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,100
He was very shocked.

167
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,160
It's true.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,320
Senpai, he's a kindergarten child.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,460
Shut up!

170
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,840
I hate this kind of naughty kid the most.

171
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,640
Hey, Lemon, do you really know how to cook?

172
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,240
Interesting.

173
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,740
I was just about to have a cooking lunch.

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,220
Why don't you be my judge?

175
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,000
No, thanks.

176
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,660
Okay.

177
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,280
It's a game.

178
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,740
What's this?

179
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,160
Do you know how to cook?

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,900
A little.

181
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,200
You're a child who touches the can every day.

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,360
Hmm.

183
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,900
This is me.

184
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,980
Which is your turn this time?

185
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,220
Yes, it's me.

186
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,100
My victory is not moving.

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,820
It's your victory.

188
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,780
What?

189
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,440
You're a child after all.

190
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm prepared to be a Honda driver.

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,840
How can I lose?

192
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,820
It's a simple crime of 33 steps.

193
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,420
33 steps?

194
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,780
Don't be stupid.

195
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,180
You're a professional if you can read that far.

196
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,540
You're surprisingly honest to admit it as a lie.

198
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,840
Children should be like that.

199
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,620
There was a simpler crime of 25 steps.

200
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,060
What?

201
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,560
Let's have this brat do it with 25 steps.

202
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,080
If you don't do it, I'll cut your ass 100 times.

203
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,420
Sekuhara.

204
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,440
Hmm.

205
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,780
What a naughty brat.

206
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,840
If you do it, what will Kankichi do?

207
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,740
Don't call me.

208
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm a brat who's not in your mind.

209
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,280
What will you do?

210
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,660
I'll stand up and go around the library.

211
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,640
I'll do it.

212
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll do it.

213
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,660
I'll do it.

214
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,280
I'll do it.

215
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,300
I'll do it.

216
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,700
I'll do it.

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
I'll do it.

218
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,460
I'll do it.

219
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,760
I'll do it.

220
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,240
I'll do it.

221
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,520
I'll do it.

222
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
I'll do it.

223
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll do it.

224
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,520
But you can't call me that way.

225
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,080
It's okay if you say that again.

226
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,200
You won't do it.

227
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,560
And I won't call you anymore.

228
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,900
It's okay.

229
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,060
If you say I won't do it, I'll do it.

230
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
You guys are too annoying.

231
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,940
I'll tell you something.

232
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,760
There's no need to lie when you say this to me.

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,800
I don't want to die.

234
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:32,820
I can do it.

235
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,720
Come to think of it, my lunch box has the same contents.

236
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,660
Hey, Komachi, you just transferred it to the lunch box!

237
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,840
Really?

238
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,640
I didn't have time to sleep to make it.

239
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,820
It's so awkward.

240
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,840
Lemon, try my lunch box.

241
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,700
I'm hungry.

242
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,540
What's with this heavy feeling of tension?

243
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,740
It's just a play.

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,100
How was it?

245
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,380
It's a season for the

246
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,500
"Sayori" .

247
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,380
In this season, the "Mebaru" and "Kanpachi" are delicious.

248
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,380
What's with that old-fashioned way of talking?

249
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,740
I don't use such words.

250
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,620
That's it! That's it!

251
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm using it!

252
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,780
Ryo-chan, you always watch old-fashioned dramas with your grandma.

253
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
Sometimes, you say strange things.

254
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,880
That's because of that old lady.

255
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,220
You're a child, but you know a lot.

256
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,080
Really?

257
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,380
How about the "Takenoko" stew?

258
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,220
I made it carefully using the best dashi of Oi-Gatsuo.

259
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,600
But it lacks the flavor of the sauce.

260
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,280
What's with that arrogant way of talking?

261
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,140
Well, well.

262
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,640
It's a "Shokado bento" of "Yadaman".

263
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,360
What?

264
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,320
I got caught!

265
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,340
What? You're a child, too?

266
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,620
That's a "Bento" of the top class.

267
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,380
I'll get caught if I do something bad.

268
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,660
Lemon, eat mine, too.

269
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,660
No, I know the winnings even if I don't eat.

270
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,320
What?

271
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,580
The appearance, the aroma, the nutrients and the calories that are needed.

272
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,640
The winnings are based on the overall balance.

273
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,560
The winnings are based on the overall balance.

274
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,800
Hehe.

275
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
I'm a child, after all.

276
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,900
I can't help but think that I'm the winner of my sister's bento.

277
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,280
I know.

278
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,360
I think Reiko's bento is the best no matter how you look at it.

279
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,100
What? Did Reiko also make it?

280
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,700
Well, it's better to have a lot of people like this.

281
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,100
Which one?

282
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
This is the "Bento" of the world!

283
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,680
It's true!

284
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,340
Foie gras and caviar truffles!

285
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,020
It's the most luxurious!

286
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,820
It's true that the ingredients alone are the best.

287
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,260
But it's not well-cooked.

288
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,280
If it's too well-cooked, you can't get the original flavor.

289
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,900
Even with caviar, you can't take it out of the can directly, so it's too salty.

290
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,640
You should add a little more.

291
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,620
You're a taste genius just by looking at it and tasting it!

292
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,020
You're amazing, Lemon-chan!

293
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,880
I-I'm a kindergarten child, but I'm not that amazing.

294
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,940
Oh, I've got a good idea!

295
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,940
Hey, Matoi!

296
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,960
Lend me an hour's worth of lemon!

297
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
What? Where are you taking me?

298
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
Well, whatever.

299
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,020
I'm sorry, but I'm going home.

300
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,720
I'm waiting for Sanpei.

301
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,680
Okay, I'll go talk to her!

302
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,200
Oh, there she is.

303
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,460
Oh, Ichiro-san!

304
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh, no!

305
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,680
She's going back to kindergarten, so I have to contact her.

306
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,660
Okay, I'll talk to her!

307
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,460
Okay, I'll talk to her!

308
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,780
Hey, Gepard!

309
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,240
What? You have a cold?

310
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,020
Shut up, don't make me a nuisance!

311
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm going to get you a big piece of money!

312
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,100
I haven't got my ears yet!

313
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,540
What do you want?

314
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,720
I'll lend you an hour's worth of lemon.

315
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,600
Nice to meet you.

316
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,140
What?

317
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,320
What are you going to do with a big egg?

318
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,780
Well, see you.

319
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,480
You're still a rebellious old lady.

320
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,800
You can go home by the second floor.

321
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,900
Oh, ah...

322
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,360
Okay, here I go!

323
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,060
Okay, I'll do it.

324
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,460
I'll show you the taste of the ramen here.

325
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,020
Do you know the taste of ramen?

326
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,700
Of course, in the north, Asahikawa, Sapporo, in the south, Hakata, and Kumamoto,

327
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,080
ramen is also common.

328
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,960
So, stop talking like that.

329
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,740
You're a child, so you have to talk cuter.

330
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,120
"Grandpa is wonderful."

331
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
"I'll put ramen in it."

332
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,000
It's creepy.

333
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,220
It's not cute.

334
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,700
You again.

335
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,980
You came without a clue.

336
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
Don't get excited.

337
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,700
I don't have ramen to eat with you.

338
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,820
Get out of here.

339
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,600
This time I'll eat it.

340
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,100
So, please, stop being so cute.

341
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm going to get out of here.

342
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,660
This is a present for you.

343
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,920
This lemon is not just a kindergarten nenji.

344
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,920
It's a kind of super kindergarten nenji, called " spear", so to speak.

345
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,000
It's shiny, so don't take it.

346
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,200
Don't talk so fast.

347
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,840
Rather, do you know the taste of ramen in your taste bud?

348
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,360
Just say so.

349
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,660
Hmm...

350
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,340
Hmm...

351
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,100
What's that?

352
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,380
Tonkotsu-sake.

353
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,700
It's made with long onions and ginger.

354
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,300
It's a secret ingredient.

355
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,600
What?

356
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,320
Right!

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,300
That's why I told you, right?

358
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,200
The lemon is the best.

359
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,060
If you know, make ramen right away.

360
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,220
Half ramen is fine.

361
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,420
Here you go.

362
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,340
Wait.

363
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,380
Here you go.

364
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,240
Here you go.

365
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,380
I'm so nervous.

366
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,900
I'm a child.

367
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,340
Oh, he's done the soup.

368
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,980
He's doing a good job.

369
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,000
Hmm...

370
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,500
How about the noodles?

371
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,640
The noodles are well-cooked.

372
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,560
Yeah, it's well-soaked in the soup.

373
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,640
You know the recipe, miss!

374
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,420
Is the chashu black pork from Kagoshima?

375
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,580
Yeah!

376
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,800
Both the cooking and the cooking are perfect.

377
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
You're so silly!

378
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,160
Our ramen is the best in Japan!

379
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,860
So, how's the lemon?

380
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,000
It's not bad.

381
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,820
Not bad?

382
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,480
It's a good taste, but it's not the best when you say it's the best in Japan.

383
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,100
What?

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,700
When I think that, the taste of this ramen has stopped.

385
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,140
The taste is something that you work hard every day and improve it.

386
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,600
If you think this is good, it's over.

387
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,080
Don't beat me like a kid!

388
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,060
To be specific,

389
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,940
The key point of this ramen is soy sauce.

390
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,760
Soy sauce?

391
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,540
Sorry, miss.

392
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,820
I used the soy sauce I made in Noda's factory.

393
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,480
I used the soy sauce I made in Noda's factory.

394
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,500
It's not bad!

395
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,440
The soy sauce is good.

396
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,980
That's right.

397
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,460
But you can tell just by drinking the soup.

398
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,180
The president changed last year.

399
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,980
Until then, the soy sauce was 100% domestic.

400
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,020
Now, he uses 20% of foreign soy sauce.

401
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,180
There is no fresh soy sauce here.

402
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,300
The reason is that seasonings are not enough for all changes,

403
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:40,660
The reason is that seasonings are not enough for all changes,

404
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,800
Is that true?

405
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,220
What a coincidence.

406
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,480
What a coincidence.

407
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,940
I can't do it yet.

408
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,460
Thank you for your help.

409
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,700
Yeah!

410
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,560
Lemon, you did a good job!

411
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,100
I've never been so depressed.

412
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,340
Lemon, you're the best.

413
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,320
Kankichi, you're too much of an adult.

414
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,640
When I'm happy and sad, I'm neither an adult nor a child.

415
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,260
The End

416
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm home.

417
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,920
Welcome back.

418
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,460
Kankichi, welcome.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,900
It's been a while, young lady.

420
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,840
Grandma was really worried about you.

421
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,960
Don't worry about her.

422
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,920
I'll take responsibility and return the lemon.

423
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,540
I'll take this.

424
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,960
What's wrong, Lemon?

425
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,300
Mom, I put it in here.

426
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,020
I don't have any lemon shoes.

427
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,260
Lemon shoes?

428
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,900
It's the shoes that the witch Remifanoe wrote.

429
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah, it was dirty.

430
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,460
I can't wear it anymore because it's too small.

431
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,560
So I threw it away.

432
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,480
It's terrible.

433
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,860
I've been taking care of it.

434
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,620
I've been taking care of it.

435
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,220
I was wearing those shoes when I went to the police.

436
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,600
I bought them for the first time with my salary.

437
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,280
Lemon...

438
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,400
You don't have to cry.

439
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,880
Oh, right. I'll buy you the same one.

440
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,180
I don't want to wear those shoes.

441
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,900
Don't say that.

442
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,180
Come here, Lemon.

443
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,480
Kankichi...

444
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,640
Kankichi?

445
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
Hey, don't bother me.

446
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,160
Lemon...

447
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,340
Where's the garbage dump?

448
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,280
Over there.

449
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:45,700
All right.

450
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,940
There's nothing here.

451
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
The garbage collector from earlier.

452
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,580
I'm sure it's him.

453
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,840
Kankichi...

454
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,660
It's okay. I'll definitely get it back.

455
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,440
There's a bike in this place.

456
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,060
Lemon, get on the back.

457
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,480
Put this on and hold on tight.

458
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,120
Yeah.

459
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,780
Let's go.

460
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey, Ichiro.

461
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,400
You have to hurry for the garbage dump to be easy to remove.

462
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,440
You have to hurry for the garbage dump to be easy to remove.

463
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,480
You need to stop.

464
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,460
Stop.

465
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,080
Stop.

466
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,720
There's a lot of garbage.

467
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,100
Stop.

468
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,160
Stop.

469
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,860
Stop.

470
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,120
Stop.

471
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,320
Stop.

472
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,300
Stop.

473
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,400
Come on, Lemon! Don't cry!

474
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,440
We'll make it!

475
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,820
Hey!

476
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,720
Where is the Super-Squad's trash?

477
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,540
Oh, there it is.

478
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,720
Kankichi...

479
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,360
It's dangerous, so stay there!

480
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,040
What color are your shoes?

481
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,960
Pink. It's pink!

482
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,200
I got it! It's pink!

483
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,760
Here I go!

484
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,240
Pink! Pink!

485
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,880
Pink! Pink!

486
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,720
Pink! Pink!

487
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,500
Pink! Pink!

488
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,060
Here I go!

489
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,680
Let go of me!

490
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,160
Pink! Pink!

491
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,420
Pink!

492
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,920
Thank you, Kankichi.

493
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,900
Huh? What for?

494
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,360
Lemon's shoes.

495
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,800
What are you talking about?

496
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,080
You found them yourself, didn't you?

497
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,460
I just picked them up.

498
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Hey, Gepard! What's that sword?

499
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,360
What's that?

500
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,940
I don't care!

501
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,220
Hey, Kankichi!

502
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,560
I'm going to pull your precious Lemon this far...

503
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,240
It's a misunderstanding!

504
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,680
What happened to my bicycle?

505
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, it's broken, so I left it at the garbage dump.

506
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,780
It might be in ruins by now.

507
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,220
What?

508
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,660
Hang in there.

509
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,040
Kankichi, the bicycle is a waste of garbage.

510
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,000
Is that so?

511
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,120
Thank you for the lemon.

512
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,640
No problem.

513
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,760
You didn't even talk to me!

514
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,240
It's a misunderstanding!

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,520
I'm going to pull your precious Lemon this far...

516
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,880
Hey, you're so annoying!

517
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,340
You're going to make me the sword of the Kaho's eyes and the hands of the Seki's grandson!

518
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,480
Grandma, you're wrong.

519
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,260
It's okay, Lemon.

520
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,300
It's dirty.

521
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,860
It's like a sport for them.

522
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,580
Grandma! Stop it!

523
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,280
Stop it!

524
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
You were so precious to me.

525
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,460
No, no, no, no!

526
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,340
Thank you.

527
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,040
Stop it!

528
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,500
Stop it!

529
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,920
Stop it!

530
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,000
Stop it!

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,060
I'm a healthy old woman!

532
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,620
Wait, Kankichi!

533
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,200
Bye, Lemon!

534
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,820
It was fun!

535
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,060
Thank you, Kankichi!

536
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,120
Bye-bye!

537
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,100
I've never seen Lemon laugh so brightly.

538
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,860
No, no, no!

539
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,660
Lemon, you can't fall in love with a man who's mistakenly married!

540
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,460
But it was fun with Kankichi.

541
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,900
Fun? Really?

542
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,700
Yeah.

543
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,320
Well, I'll forgive you for today.

544
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,180
Thanks, Grandma!
