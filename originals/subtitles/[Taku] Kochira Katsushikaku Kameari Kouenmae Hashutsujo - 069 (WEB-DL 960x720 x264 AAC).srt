2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,660
I look at the sunset that floats in the middle of the river.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,800
When I kick the stone, it flies to my shoes.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,100
I wonder if I'm going to save money.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,080
I was laughed at as it was.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,660
Even if I try to cheer up, I can only win.

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,840
There is a camel and a badger.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that doesn't change is strangely gentle.

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,780
I wonder if I'm going to save money. I wonder if I'm going to save money.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,020
I wonder if I'm going to save money.

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,980
From the main waterway of Tongari-boshi to Kaishakuten,

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,080
the sunset falls.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this.

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,620
I lost my happiness because I was happy.

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,900
I noticed.

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,460
I'm an idiot.

17
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,360
Grandpa and the Bomberman

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,880
Well, sir.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,120
When the Abashin villa was here,

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,560
I was called Okuyama, the eight-man killer.

21
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,780
I was probably threatened.

22
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,560
Now, I live a life of revenge.

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,940
I have done everything right.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,780
For a day, it became so much bigger.

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,160
There's nothing I've ever seen.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
You don't think so?

27
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,220
It will be hard to see you go up and go down?

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,740
I think it's a little too much.

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,500
Take a shot of and replace it.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Well, if you don't play hard, it's not a big deal.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,480
Now come on, that's the beaker you want

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,580
You can't show off the spoilers.

33
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,540
Get away from that woman.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,060
Stop it! I'm busy and can't take care of you!

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,060
Damn it!

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,880
You too!

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
I wonder if he can tell from this photo.

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,520
No, no.

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,720
You're a total mess.

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,740
I can't use a gun.

41
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,280
If I were to use it, I'd have to use my head more.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,160
What do you think?

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,320
Huh?

44
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,620
Hey, can you give me a cup of tea?

45
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm not sure if you can.

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm so used to hearing about new people.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,280
Ah, I see.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,340
You're still as friendly as ever.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,340
That's not how it used to be in the past.

50
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,420
Really?

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,640
Huh?

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,520
That's not how it used to be in the past!

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,920
Back in the day, you'd be nice to a local like me.

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,280
You'd be nice to me and be nice to me.

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,020
Sometimes, you'd come to me for advice.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,600
You'd be nice to me and be nice to me.

57
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,140
You'd be nice to me and be nice to me.

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,440
You'd be nice to me and be nice to me.

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,340
Sometimes, you'd be nice to me and be nice to me.

60
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,980
At least, I'd give you advice.

61
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,920
Sometimes, you'd be nice to me and be nice to me.

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,900
Once I got to see you, you won't even be nice to me.

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:31,920
Same thing here.

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
- Hey! - You, too.

65
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,140
I've seen enough of you, learn from those people.

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,400
I know!

67
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,380
Yeah, I'll be like that.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,560
And I'll go and support the men.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
I'mma have time, wait for me.

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,860
Everyone was scared.

71
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,400
I had to tell them about our date.

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,940
Okuyama.

73
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,120
Oh, this is Gome.

74
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,420
And Dai.

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,900
Actually, there's a thing between these two.

76
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,520
There's a thing between these two.

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,720
Here you are.

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,960
Why do I have to pay for it?

79
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,120
Chief, here's the deadline for last month.

80
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,780
That's good.

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,920
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,820
I'll write it down this month.

83
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,260
Don't do that.

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,700
I'll give you a special mission.

85
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,680
What?

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,740
Hey, Mr. Ochi.

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
I want to eat matcha ice cream for dessert.

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,340
What?

89
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,020
I've decided to eat matcha ice cream after dinner.

90
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,800
I can't eat it except for Morikame Seikai.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That place is the best.

92
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,180
Okuyama.

93
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,540
Since we're here,

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll send you to Ryotsu's house.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,820
It's about time.

96
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,240
I'll send you there.

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,800
It's you!

98
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,520
You're the one who took the luggage of the Kazushika office,

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,900
the police officer and Ryotsu of Shiba.

100
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Huh?

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,620
What's with this old man?

102
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,340
He's too arrogant.

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,780
Well, well, we're looking forward to working with you.

104
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,960
Fine, I know.

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,700
I'll send you to home, no matter what.

106
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,680
Don't be careless.

107
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,360
I got it.

108
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,440
Damn it. Why do I have to send such an old man for the Shimasu office?

109
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,460
What? Is there something you want to say?

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,760
I thought you were a good husband.

111
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,980
What?

112
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,900
There's no doubt. I've seen you for many years.

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,780
You're a good man now, but you'll be the best in Japan soon.

114
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,900
I see. How about a drink at my house?

115
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,820
Sounds good.

116
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,640
When did you get that sake?

117
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,520
From there.

118
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,700
From there?

119
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,580
Don't take it from me.

120
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
You're so mean.

121
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
This one. I think this one is better.

122
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,460
Hey!

123
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Welcome.

124
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,260
My grandson will pay for the money.

125
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,260
Wait!

126
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,620
That's right.

127
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,380
You're so mean.

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,780
Where did you go?

129
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,320
How is it?

130
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,300
It's a bit expensive, but I recommend it.

131
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,980
It's a good deal.

132
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,900
My grandson will pay for the money.

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,060
Wait!

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,480
You're so mean!

135
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,760
I'll kill you!

136
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,160
You're so mean!

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,440
Get out of here!

138
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,400
What are you doing?

139
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,120
He's a good man.

140
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,860
How can I kill him?

141
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,320
No, this is...

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll take it.

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,360
He's under all the pressure.

144
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,640
I'll take it.

145
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
I'll take it.

146
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,100
What is that?

147
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,460
Wait, wait, why are you doing this?

148
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,220
Take your daughter to the hospital.

149
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,480
You won't die from nothing.

150
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,860
That's where I live.

151
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,900
We were living together and we had nothing.

152
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,940
Debut.

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
I'll be back in two days.

154
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,700
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,800
Is your son born in Niijima?

156
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,120
They have a brother.

157
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,780
I'll get him from the hospital.

158
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,440
Sorry for making you worry, Ryo.

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,480
Don't be so mean!

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
You're older than me, so you don't deserve it.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Where's the house?

162
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,820
Here.

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,120
What?

164
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,680
Is this your house?

165
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,840
It's my son's.

166
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Your son's?

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,520
He's always putting out the laundry.

168
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,440
Get in the car.

169
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,120
Yeah.

170
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,200
Wow!

171
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
Napoleon and Hennessy.

172
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,380
All expensive drinks.

173
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,800
Do whatever you want.

174
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,000
Is that alright?

175
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,020
Yeah.

176
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,220
My son's wife buys him drinks for his overseas trips.

177
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,540
But he's living such a good life.

178
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,880
Why would he do something like that?

179
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,680
Good life?

180
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,800
He's a top-notch fighter.

181
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,300
He's a hero.

182
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
His wife is Miss Universe.

183
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,060
His grandchild is the president of the school.

184
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,940
His cat is a fighter, too.

185
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,960
Ha ha.

186
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,120
You're laughing at me, Ryo.

187
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,600
I used to be a man of my word, but I can't win against my age.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,500
Now I'm taking care of my son.

189
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,220
But...

190
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,800
Yeah.

191
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,380
I'm a man of my word.

192
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,760
My son's like a poisonous bug in a new house.

193
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,580
Yeah.

194
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,440
His wife doesn't want to eat with me.

195
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,480
His grandchild...

196
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,240
His grandchild still calls me "grandpa."

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,040
That's a tough story.

198
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,040
I've had enough of this.

199
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll make you some snacks.

200
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,860
It's easy.

201
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,340
Yeah.

202
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,580
Mikaki is a poor old man.

203
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,380
You bastard!

204
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:26,760
You bastard!

205
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,200
You bastard!

206
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,660
You bastard!

207
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,140
You bastard!

208
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
You bastard!

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,700
You bastard!

210
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,160
You bastard!

211
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,920
You bastard!

212
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,480
You bastard!

213
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,740
You bastard!

214
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,860
Don't touch!

215
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,620
Don't touch!

216
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,100
He's yelling again and again!

217
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
You bastard.

218
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,620
You bastard!

219
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't touch me.

220
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,560
You bastard!

221
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,340
You bastard!

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,020
Don't touch me!

223
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,180
Stay down!

224
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
You bastard!

225
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,680
I don't have an old man!

226
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,600
What? He's your father!

227
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,760
Father?

228
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,240
You tricked me, old man!

229
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,240
Damn it! Where did that old man go?

230
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,740
If you find him, I'll poke him in the ear and make him talk!

231
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,880
What's wrong? Did you fall?

232
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,040
Stop!

233
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,460
What a boring play!

234
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,440
Why don't you call your granddad?

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,340
Mr. Ryo, I want to take a look at it.

236
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,060
This is the real house.

237
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
Here? It's like a tanke gym.

238
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,040
Grandpa, is there no family?

239
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,680
Oh, I'm all alone.

240
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,600
I've been living in the city for a long time, but that's a lie.

241
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,760
There are umbrellas and umbrellas in the rain.

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,400
It's so cold in winter.

243
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,160
Well, this is also a rust from the body.

244
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,240
I cut the leaves of the tea.

245
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,740
Yeah, I'm fine with water.

246
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,340
Oh, no. I'll go buy it, so wait a minute.

247
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,600
Grandpa is having a hard time, too.

248
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,980
What?

249
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,240
What?

250
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,580
What is this?

251
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,880
Hey, it's huge!

252
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm too tired.

253
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,760
Hey, stop! There's someone in here!

254
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,900
Chris...

255
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
Dragon King Jr.

256
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:34,900
Dragon King Jr.

257
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,920
Dragon King Junior

258
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,720
Dragon King Junior

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
Monogatari

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,820
Jun

261
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,140
Fuck you!

262
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,580
Go away!

263
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,060
We should just chase him now.

264
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,680
I was thinking he might have some more bones.

265
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
What?

266
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Maybe before he uses me?

267
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:00,820
What?

268
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,580
That old man...

269
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,780
Huh? What's that?

270
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,220
Everyone!

271
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,260
I'm in the Departure Sky where there's been a series of riots!

272
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,540
The culprit was chased by the police around 6:00 PM,

273
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,340
and ran into this department!

274
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,720
He ran up to the roof,

275
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,120
and then he ran into an old man who happened to be with him!

276
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,580
A man suddenly came in because he had a gun.

277
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,920
He's running away.

278
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,400
I don't know what's going on!

279
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,580
Don't shoot!

280
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,560
The police chief is on duty!

281
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,440
Hey! Save me!

282
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,060
Hey!

283
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,900
No!

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,860
The host is asking for help!

285
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,480
Hey!

286
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm the police!

287
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,160
Damn it!

288
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,380
It's that old man!

289
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,940
What?

290
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,840
Isn't that Ryotsu?

291
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,360
Yes, sir.

292
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,360
What's wrong with that face?

293
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,600
You look like a man.

294
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,660
That doesn't matter!

295
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,600
Let me in!

296
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,380
You can't!

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,460
The chief has been ordered not to let anyone in until he comes!

298
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,340
Chief?

299
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,560
So, what's the culprit's request?

300
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,120
Oh, a car for a runaway with a fine of 5 million yen.

301
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,900
Get a car for a runaway with 5 million yen.

302
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,780
Okay, I'll convince him.

303
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,080
You think he'll believe it?

304
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,140
What?

305
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,020
It's nothing compared to the old man in Okoyama.

306
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,300
Damn it!

307
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,060
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,020
I'm sorry.

310
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,260
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,060
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,740
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:05,920
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm sorry.

319
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,740
I'm sorry.

320
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm sorry.

321
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,660
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,960
Damn.

326
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,500
I must bring that old man back before he finds out.

327
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,020
Or else my position will be...

328
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm telling the truth!

329
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,080
I'm the chief of Katoshika camp, Tom ISUKI.

330
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,980
Stop pretending, and come out quietly!

331
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,720
Shut up!

332
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,660
I'm counting on you, Oharu.

333
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
Come on, come on.

334
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,780
Gome and Dai are too much for us.

335
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,820
We have no choice but to protect ourselves.

336
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Come on!

337
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
Get the car and the 5 million yen!

338
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,180
Poor you.

339
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,440
What?

340
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,700
The special forces are coming.

341
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,840
You're a bad guy.

342
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,640
No way.

343
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,600
We have a hostage.

344
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,500
You can't run away if you use your head.

345
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,580
Don't underestimate the police.

346
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,680
What?

347
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,500
What are they doing?

348
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm telling you.

349
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,780
The old women are the hardest to kill.

350
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,420
I know.

351
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,860
I've known it for a long time.

352
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,540
Who are you?

353
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,320
Me?

354
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,980
You know, don't you?

355
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,440
The case of the 3 million yen robbery in 1943.

356
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,620
I know that much.

357
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,880
Don't tell me you...

358
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,760
It's okay, Yasue.

359
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Leave this to me.

360
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
What should we do?

361
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,760
You idiot, get on the car.

362
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,500
First, go to the control room for the emergency.

363
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,880
Don't let them in.

364
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
Go, go, go!

365
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,680
What?

366
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:23,180
What's going on?

367
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,280
Chief.

368
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,780
The way you enter the department's building has been set.

369
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,460
What?

370
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,340
I'm testing it.

371
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,520
I'm sorry.

372
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,800
President Gomez!

373
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,340
300 million yen in an hour!

374
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,760
500 million yen!

375
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,560
Bring 500 million yen!

376
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,020
Prepare a helicopter to escape!

377
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,320
A jumbo jet to escape abroad!

378
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,760
Prepare a jumbo jet to escape abroad!

379
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,560
That old man...

380
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,760
Are you alright, old man?

381
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,580
You can't be so nice.

382
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,020
And bring three specials for Sushi Masa!

383
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,580
Bring three specials for Sushi Masa!

384
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,060
Damn it.

385
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,080
He's asking for it.

386
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,740
I've never eaten a special.

387
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,800
I'll tell the culprit.

388
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,600
I can't accept your request.

389
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,820
Release the sheep and come down.

390
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,820
What should we do, old man?

391
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,420
Just do as I say.

392
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,020
That's what the former president, Tonda Gomez, said when he was a judge.

393
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,740
What?

394
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,820
A man who fell in love with a woman...

395
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,960
Mr. Gomez said he'd die if he didn't marry her.

396
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,220
And he left his job.

397
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,720
He sat in front of her house for a week.

398
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
He was about to be fired.

399
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,880
Shut up! What are you talking about?

400
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,380
He's an old man.

401
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,360
And he has three lovers.

402
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,640
It's a very touching story.

403
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,480
President, are you serious?

404
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,640
You're such a fool!

405
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,480
But why does the culprit know such a truth?

406
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,400
It's not true.

407
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,840
President, is the old man...

408
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,580
Damn it!

409
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,880
He's talking so much that he's advertising his presence!

410
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,160
Next, Tonda Gomez, Ohara, Taijiro, and Ryo...

411
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,040
They're fighting for money in Yoshiwara.

412
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,040
They're the police.

413
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,980
President, that's not...

414
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,960
Bad news.

415
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,140
I'll tell the culprit.

416
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,260
Don't be hasty.

417
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,540
Prepare 500 million yen immediately.

418
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,100
President!

419
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,480
Grandpa...

420
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,900
Huh?

421
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Cheers!

422
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,800
Ah, um...

423
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
It's Shimada.

424
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,860
I brought you a special order.

425
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,980
President, what should we do next?

426
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,160
Hmm...

427
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,160
Should we shoot a rocket at a hostage?

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,600
President!

429
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,140
Grandpa, you're amazing.

430
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,160
500 million yen is a lot, isn't it?

431
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,040
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,320
Well, yeah.

433
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,120
Hey, teach me when you get 300 million yen, okay?

434
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,320
Yeah, right.

435
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,040
At that time, I was really nervous.

436
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,680
But it's not an opportunity to let it slip.

437
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
Dear dearest...

438
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,500
I decided to put it out of my mind-

439
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,600
Everywhere, everyone trusts me!

440
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,880
Hey, old man!

441
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,140
You're not old!

442
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,720
I thought you were drunk, but you're eating sushi.

443
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,420
Where did you come from?

444
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,540
Don't get close!

445
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,180
Shut up! I have a complaint with this old man!

446
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,920
Idiot!

447
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,360
I have a complaint here!

448
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,120
What?

449
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,940
I don't want to follow my plan because of you!

450
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,460
It's a bad plan anyway!

451
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
Shut up, you!

452
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,260
What do you say?

453
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,060
Shut up!

454
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,760
You don't have any business!

455
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,200
Wait, I'll talk to you!

456
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,140
Shut up!

457
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
I'll split the money between you and my grandpa!

458
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,080
I won't let anyone get in my way!

459
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,600
Split the money?

460
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,980
What the hell are you talking about?

461
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,860
If you're in my way, I'll get rid of you!

462
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,040
Damn it!

463
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,980
I should have knocked you down!

464
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,820
I'll get you out of here!

465
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,420
What are you going to do if you get hit?

466
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm fine!

467
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,820
Don't you have a problem with me?

468
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,220
Shut up you bastard, your head is on fire!

469
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,360
Just what are you going to do with your head?!

470
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,340
You! You betrayed me!

471
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,360
Watch this!

472
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,200
What?

473
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,940
That's a cow's eye!

474
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,280
That's it!

475
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,100
That's an explosion, remember!

476
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,620
Go on and die along the wrong path!

477
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,540
Wait!

478
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh no...

479
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,520
It's a dimensional device, so it won't explode.

480
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,940
You're fooling me, you bastard!

481
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,180
What the hell?

482
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,000
Hey, grandpa, retreat!

483
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,380
Ryo, stay there!

484
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,060
Okay, tie me up!

485
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,120
Leave it to me.

486
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,980
My tie is a military hell!

487
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,640
Okay, I'll do it.

488
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,840
Good job, grandpa.

489
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,100
See you.

490
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,780
Hey, where are you going?

491
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,680
I'll be out in a minute.

492
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,580
What?

493
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,340
Ryo, you're the one who did it.

494
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,480
You were a good friend to me when I was treated as a troublemaker.

495
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,180
You came to save me without looking at the danger of your life.

496
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,720
I was so happy.

497
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,380
Grandpa, I'll be out in a minute.

498
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,780
Grandpa, come to the bridge if you're lonely.

499
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,740
Everyone is a nice guy.

500
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,060
Come on!

501
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,520
What?

502
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,660
Hey, grandpa, you did it!

503
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,560
There are still many more, Ryo.

504
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,220
Hey, come back here!

505
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,640
No!

506
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Oh, it seems that Ryo arrested the culprit.

507
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,360
What? Ryo?

508
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Somebody, please help me!

509
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:05,960
Hey!

510
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
It's a departmental prison case where a long prison sentence was expected.

511
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,920
But the culprit was arrested by a brave policeman.

512
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,100
Do the truth before the DevOps case.

513
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,720
What is up with you this time?

514
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,440
That's right.

515
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,960
You have gloves on.

516
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,600
The police?

517
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,060
I'll give an example.

518
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,740
The police have requested the police to report the secondä»–ä»¬.

519
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,580
Aunt, something is happening.

520
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,280
Yes, I think it's dangerous to go to the police station.

521
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,340
Well.

522
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,380
I will go now.

523
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,040
Goods are here.

524
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,240
Can you go?

525
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes.

526
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,360
Hahaha!

527
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,760
Huh?

528
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,080
Hey, Reiko.

529
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm back.

530
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Oh, you're back already?

531
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,600
Oh, Ryo!

532
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,920
Oh, Senpai!

533
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,220
Are you alright?

534
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,920
Grandpa.

535
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,960
What are you doing here?

536
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,860
I came to play with you.

537
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Ryo.

538
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,260
You got the president's award, right?

539
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,120
Congratulations!

540
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,820
Thank you.

541
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,420
Grandpa, you're funny.

542
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,720
I heard you're friends with the president and the chief.

543
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,780
I heard a lot of funny stories about you.

544
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,320
Ryo, sit down.

545
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,400
This tofu is delicious.

546
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,380
It's handmade.

547
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Ryo, next.

548
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,100
Chief.

549
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
What's wrong with the pressure gauge?

550
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,500
Just a little bit more.

551
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,020
Come here.

552
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,960
Ouch!

553
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,780
You're going to be hospitalized again?

554
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,280
You're the one who's going to be in trouble.

555
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,300
Why is the old man from Okuyama here?

556
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,240
I don't know.

557
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,600
Chief.

558
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,720
You said you'd come.

559
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm the boss.

560
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:47,740
Ouch!

561
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,060
Ouch!

562
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,680
Please forgive me.

563
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm a victim too.

564
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,780
Ryo!

565
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,140
I'm sorry.

566
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,540
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm sorry.

568
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,180
I'm sorry.

569
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,740
I'm a victim too.

570
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,800
Ryo.

571
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,460
Ryo, I'm sorry.

572
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,280
Ryo, I'm sorry.

573
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,620
You're the one who's going to be in trouble.

574
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,960
Ryo!

575
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,340
I'm sorry.

576
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm sorry.

577
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Ryo!

578
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,680
Ryo!

579
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,940
I'm sorry.

580
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm sorry.

581
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,260
I'm sorry.

582
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,880
Rumor has it that I'm a little too young

583
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,040
But there are so many things I want to do

584
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm a little too young

585
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,440
I want to ride in a bike

586
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
In the vast desert

587
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,240
I want to be free

588
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,160
More than a bird

589
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,900
I want to be free

590
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,220
The speed of the full moon

591
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,980
Changes into a lady's dream

592
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,980
My love, I'm sorry

593
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,240
Wait for me

594
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,280
The future of the panorama

595
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,060
The dazzling light that dives in

596
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,540
You understand, right?

597
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm sorry

598
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,900
Wait for me
