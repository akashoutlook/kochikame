1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,260
Please be careful when you watch TV!

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,380
When you watch TV, light up the room and look away!

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,980
Come to me, you penniless!

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,720
Look at the blue sky!

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
White clouds!

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,120
I'll manage somehow.

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,800
You know it! You know it! You know it!

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,380
If you know it, come to me quietly!

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,180
I'll manage somehow.

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,880
Ryo-tsu and Ryo-tsu?

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,140
The End

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,560
The End

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,620
The End

15
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,360
The End

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,500
The End

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,800
The End

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:51,680
I broke the Miracle Cracker!

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,860
The End

20
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,520
Chooooooooon!

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,040
Oh, it's a mirror.

22
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm surprised.

23
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,300
I'll sleep a little longer.

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,240
You idiot!

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,120
Who are you?

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,540
Who are you?

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,860
I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,860
I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi, too.

29
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,060
What do you mean?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,880
My birthday is March 3rd.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,280
I ate natto-chahan soup for dinner the day before yesterday.

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,340
What did you do yesterday that made you angry?

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,720
I skipped work and slept at a manga cafe.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,540
Why do you know such a thing?

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,440
Why are you so familiar with it?

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Are you me?

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Am I you?

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,560
Are you Ryo-tsu?

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,680
Well, for the time being, it can't be helped that this happened.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,520
We're together now, so let's think about it a little more positively.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,080
Yes.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,000
As expected of me.

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,780
You say good things.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,200
So what exactly do you do?

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,760
That's right.

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,640
For example,

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,760
I work in two shifts.

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,520
Oh!

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,600
Then you can take a break in the shift and increase your holidays.

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,020
Then I'll take a break today.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,040
I proposed it.

52
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,340
Why don't you hold back a little?

53
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,060
Why don't you look forward to it later?

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,880
No, no, you're the one.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,640
You're the one.

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
You say that, you're the one.

57
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,480
Hmm...

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,080
This bastard, Egoist!

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm embarrassed!

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,040
It's not like you're the only one who wouldn't want to be called!

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,740
Hmm act cheeky me.

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,280
That's not what it means!

63
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,580
Ryo went away.

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,580
What time is it now?

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,640
At what time is it to change that attitude?

66
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm going to do it again.

67
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,400
That's not the problem, is it?

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,540
I'm the one who's in it.

69
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,320
Shut up! Don't scream in the stereo.

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,160
I'm not surprised at all by what you're doing.

71
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,700
As expected of the chief.

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,380
You're not surprised at all.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,200
Even so, I really only see the same thing.

74
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,040
I've always thought you were a mysterious person.

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,340
No, I didn't think I'd be able to do something like this.

76
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,280
You're impressed, aren't you?

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,060
But you're great.

78
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,140
If you have two people, you can take a break, but you come to work together.

79
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,520
No, I thought so at first.

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,620
Thanks to this idiot.

81
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,880
What did you just say?

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,560
I said you were an idiot.

83
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,060
It means that the two of you have doubled your labor.

84
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,740
You're working two people because you're slacking off every day.

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,820
No way.

86
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Then, Ryo-chan.

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,260
I'm going to work.

88
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,560
What?

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,520
Every time you call me Ryo-chan, it's confusing to react with both of you.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
It's true that both of you seem like seniors.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,800
All right.

92
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,900
Well, then.

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
If you do this,

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,740
It's done.

95
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,400
If I were Ryo-A,

96
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,140
I'll call you Ryo-B.

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,320
Wait a minute.

98
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,600
Why am I B?

99
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,020
Because you're the second me.

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,940
So I'm A and you're B.

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
No, you're wrong.

102
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,060
There's no evidence that you're the first one and the second one is me.

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,280
I see.

104
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,280
I thought you were a copy or a fake.

105
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,960
But from what you see, I look like a copy or a fake.

106
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,100
That's right.

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,380
Anyway, I'm also me.

108
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,020
It can't be helped.

109
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,880
Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,900
All right.

111
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,960
Here we go.

112
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,440
At first, I'm good.

113
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,940
What?

114
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,980
I said I'm good at first.

115
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,700
You're the first one.

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,280
Then I'm not good at first.

117
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,580
It's a game.

118
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,120
Rock-paper-scissors.

119
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,700
Don't play hard to get.

120
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
You're a human scum.

121
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,340
If you can't decide by yourself, I'll decide by myself.

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,000
You're A and you're B.

123
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,420
If you understand, get to work.

124
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,640
All right.

125
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,200
Then I'll decide by myself.

126
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,260
Why am I working at the orange box?

127
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,360
Senior, do you mind?

128
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,580
What?

129
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm fine alone.

130
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,160
Then I'll help you.

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,480
Do it yourself.

132
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,480
I won't die.

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
Ryo, help me.

134
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm calling you.

135
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,020
You're the one who was called.

136
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,120
But Reiko said Ryo-chan.

137
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
You're Ryo-chan, right?

138
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,180
You too.

139
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,460
I'm not convinced of Ryo-chan and B.

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,980
The chief decided, so I can't help it.

141
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,940
Why am I working at the orange box?

142
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,820
You're B.

143
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,980
If you don't like B, you can choose Ryo-chan.

144
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,840
It would be great if you two split up.

145
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,800
At least you two should work as one person.

146
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,740
You're a criminal.

147
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,340
A criminal?

148
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,000
What?

149
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,240
What's wrong?

150
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,040
What's wrong with you?

151
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,740
I'm in the toilet.

152
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,440
It's a coincidence.

153
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm in the toilet too.

154
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,840
The toilet is not that way.

155
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,080
Ryo-chan.

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,900
I can see through your behavior patterns.

157
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,520
It's about time you want to skip it.

158
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,380
Damn it.

159
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,860
It's because you're standing up on purpose.

160
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
You're a liar.

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,820
You're lying.

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,800
What did you say?

163
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:42,980
You're B.

164
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,140
What?

165
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,300
Stop it.

166
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,980
Yes.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,640
It's patrol time.

168
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,960
Chief, you're not skipping it.

169
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,140
It's my turn today.

170
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,180
Yes.

171
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,660
You two can't go.

172
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,040
You stay here and organize the documents.

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,260
I can't help it.

174
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,380
I have one thing to do.

175
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,860
Fight fair and square.

176
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,920
It's fine.

177
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,980
I'll decide.

178
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,680
Ryo A, you stay.

179
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,200
Ryo B, patrol well.

180
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,140
Yes, I'll go.

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,340
I like being alone.

182
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm not good at it, Ryo A.

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,340
How's it going, Ryo's boss?

184
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,100
What's up, Honda?

185
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,420
What's wrong?

186
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,060
It looks like you're having a lot of fun.

187
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,380
Well...

188
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,220
I see.

189
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,580
All right.

190
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
Damn it.

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,840
Why only me?

192
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,280
I found you, Senpai.

193
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:50,860
What?

194
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,900
Nothing.

195
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,740
Give me back the money.

196
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,100
Money?

197
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,920
What are you talking about?

198
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,200
What are you talking about?

199
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,000
I told you to come get it later because I'll give it back soon.

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
I don't know.

201
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,600
I don't borrow money from you.

202
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,120
I don't borrow money from you.

203
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,920
It's my first time meeting you today.

204
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,860
Don't be silly.

205
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,120
Give it back quickly.

206
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,840
I have to pay for the bike parts.

207
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,800
I won't die.

208
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,060
What?

209
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,960
Ryo, Kikanki.

210
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,740
You're already at your limit today.

211
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,420
Did I do something?

212
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,820
Don't play with our pato car.

213
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,700
When I first ran into you, why did I cause trouble?

214
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,360
You're out of your mind.

215
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,840
You must give me my money back.

216
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,840
You want to give me money back?

217
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,140
Why don't you get along?

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,560
Stop it.

219
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,180
Not my business.

220
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,380
I want my money back.

221
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,720
You're not going even if I pay you back.

222
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,940
Hey, Eiko, what are you doing?

223
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm trying to find a way to get your money back, or learn some new Kentucky.

224
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,220
What are the mom and dad doing?

225
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:02,940
I them how you get theirs?

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,500
I got my money back because I couldn't give you money back.

227
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,440
I see...

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:04,740
Why are you here?

229
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm going to help you.

230
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,900
You're wrong!

231
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
Senpai!

232
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,180
Damn, B! You did whatever you wanted because of me!

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,480
Huh? Wait, I should do it too.

234
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:29,560
Hehehe, A must be having a hard time right now.

235
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,780
Good for you.

236
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,180
How about that?

237
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,600
Huh? What?

238
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,240
You did whatever you wanted, didn't you?

239
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm sure you're prepared.

240
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,800
What are you talking about?

241
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,160
Hmph, you're so stupid.

242
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,740
But that's it.

243
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,040
Look at that.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,720
How dare you do that to my Samba!

245
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,060
How dare you do that to my dog!

246
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,900
How dare you do that to my dog!

247
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,420
Give me back my dog!

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
What's that?

249
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,340
Just like you did to me,

250
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,480
I'll do the same to you.

251
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,340
I did a lot of things because of you.

252
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,680
What?

253
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,600
You're running around and reflecting on yourself.

254
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,880
Oh, I remember!

255
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,120
Yay, idiot!

256
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,760
Just watch me!

257
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,280
Hehehe.

258
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,900
I'll do the same to you!

259
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,600
No way.

260
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,960
Everyone's doing the same thing to that dog.

261
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,080
Damn it.

262
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,120
I was the same.

263
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Hey!

264
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,460
Yaaaaa!

265
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,640
Yaaaaa!

266
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,060
Haha, what a dumbass!

267
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,340
You're the one who did it!

268
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,000
You should be the one to blame!

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,980
I called you B or 2 for nothing!

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,300
What a loser!

271
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,780
What?

272
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,940
You bastard!

273
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,380
Yaaaaa!

274
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,040
Hey, you!

275
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Yaaaaa!

276
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,960
Yaaaaa!

277
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,300
Yaaaaa!

278
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Yaaaaa!

279
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,220
Yaaaaa!

280
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,160
It hurts.

281
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,140
Oh, crap.

282
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,780
That was mean.

283
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,680
I've been beaten up.

284
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
You're the one who did this.

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's stop it.

286
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,800
Let's sleep.

287
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,720
This is a nightmare.

288
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,820
Tomorrow will be the same as the day before.

289
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,900
The End

290
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,520
Don't tell me...

291
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,100
What's going on here?

292
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,420
The End

293
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,600
The End

294
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,080
I don't know why this happened...

295
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,020
But we are six now.

296
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,460
What are we going to do?

297
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,740
Hmm...

298
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,640
I knew it.

299
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
If we take a day off, we'll be free for six days.

300
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,260
Hooray!

301
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
I knew it.

302
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
I know what you're talking about.

303
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,260
I failed yesterday.

304
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,680
I'll do my best today.

305
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,940
I'll take a day off today.

306
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,640
I'll take care of it.

307
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,200
Idiot!

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400
What's going on here?

309
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,020
You've been living like a policeman for days.

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,420
That's why you're like this.

311
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,020
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,240
You make me angry.

313
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,300
What do you mean?

315
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,440
I don't want to be a policeman.

316
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,760
Wait.

317
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,020
"Welcome!"

318
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,840
"I'll start with the food."

319
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
"I'm hungry, so I can't start anything."

320
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,320
"It'll be 17,502 yen."

321
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,220
"What?!"

322
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,100
"You guys are buying too much!"

323
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,000
"You're the one who's buying!"

324
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,440
"Don't start buying manga in the morning!"

325
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,740
"You're buying the same manga!"

326
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,460
"Wait a minute!"

327
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,960
"I found it!"

328
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,980
"I just realized that we're six people now, but we have six wallets?"

329
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
"I found it!"

330
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,360
"So we only have one wallet."

331
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,020
"So we only have one."

332
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,520
"It can't be helped. I'm not rich enough to pay for food for six people."

333
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,900
"That's true. But how do we split it?"

334
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,780
"That's right."

335
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,580
"Oh, we have pig's feet!"

336
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,060
"If this happens, we'll lose quickly!"

337
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
"Oh, you guys!"

338
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,180
"The croquettes are mine!"

339
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,020
"I'll take the food! Winner!"

340
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,660
"I won't give the food to anyone."

341
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,300
"Thanks to you, we're all rich now."

342
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,200
"It's going to be tough from now on."

343
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,560
"But we're six people now, so we can do our jobs well."

344
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,400
"I see."

345
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,920
"So, let's do it."

346
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,020
"Come on!"

347
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,300
"Come on."

348
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,540
"Come on."

349
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,440
"Come on."

350
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,340
"Come on."

351
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,220
"Come on."

352
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,520
"Come on."

353
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:39,600
"Come on, Come on. Come on."

354
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,880
"Come on, Come on!"

355
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:54,060
"Come on, Come on!"

356
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,400
"Come on!"

357
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,160
I don't know what to do.

358
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,540
Well, then...

359
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,280
Yesterday, we had a fight.

360
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,220
Don't complain.

361
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,320
Just get to work.

362
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,940
Yes, sir.

363
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, it can't be helped.

364
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,420
Anyway, let's do our best under the same roof.

365
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,820
Yes.

366
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,240
Okay, let's go to bed.

367
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm going to bed.

368
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,940
I'm going to bed.

369
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,320
I'll patrol well today.

370
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,100
Don't bother me.

371
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,520
I got the top.

372
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,460
What's this?

373
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,260
Don't bother me.

374
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,320
You're going to do it again.

375
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm at my limit.

376
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,980
I'm going to take it.

377
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,420
Cheese.

378
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,640
let me eat.

379
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,760
What's this?

380
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,280
You ...

381
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,980
is it good?

382
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,840
Go!

383
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,860
Go!

384
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,340
You're going to die!

385
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,580
You're a big person!

386
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,260
You know what to do!

387
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,320
After a few days

388
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm tired.

389
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm tired.

390
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,100
The manager was really busy.

391
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,320
Anyway,

392
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,120
let's have aaga.

393
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,540
Thanks to your kindness, I was able to get a lot of bread.

394
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,300
Wow!

395
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,580
It's been a while since I had a feast.

396
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,800
I'll eat it!

397
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,820
What's that?

398
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,040
What's wrong D? Aren't you going to eat it?

399
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,460
I... I can't wait anymore...

400
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,800
I can't endure it anymore!

401
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,200
What's wrong D?

402
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,240
I was supposed to be living a comfortable life by myself.

403
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,200
But now there's more people living together,

404
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,560
I can't eat well, and I have nowhere to sleep!

405
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,480
I don't want this anymore! I'm leaving this house!

406
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,880
Hey, D!

407
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,860
I guess it's true what D said.

408
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,380
I used to live with six people, but it's not normal.

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,180
I can't do this anymore.

410
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,020
This is not the life I wanted!

411
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,320
Hey!

412
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,540
I'm leaving too!

413
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,920
I've been taking care of you until now!

414
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,780
Hey!

415
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
You too...

416
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,260
If we live together like this, there will be problems again.

417
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,500
If that happens, it's no use fighting with the same people.

418
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,280
So we're leaving too.

419
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,220
See you!

420
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,180
Hey! Wait a minute!

421
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,500
Wait a minute!

422
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,540
Wait a minute!

423
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,580
Wait a minute!

424
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,020
Hey, wait!

425
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,080
Wait!

426
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,660
Hey, wait!

427
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,680
What's going on?

428
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,740
What's going on?

429
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,260
What's going on?

430
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,700
Wait a minute.

431
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,460
What's going on?

432
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,060
What's going on?

433
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,280
Hey, wait a minute!

434
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,040
Well, it's not our fault.

435
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,480
Let's see.

436
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,640
I can't do this anymore!

437
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,740
I'm going to the bathroom!

438
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,440
Let's go!

439
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:18,700
Sorry.

440
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:18,980
It's not there.

441
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,440
Here's the weather.

442
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,820
It's a strong wind from the continent.

443
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,120
The Japanese archipelago is in a typical winter-like pressure arrangement.

444
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,100
It will be especially cold tonight.

445
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,580
Next is the weather in various places.

446
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,180
What? Did you come back after all?

447
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,140
You always do your own things.

448
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,560
You came back well.

449
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,980
I'm sorry. The person next to me is on leave, so I'll take my luggage.

450
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,200
Oh, yeah.

451
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,260
Good day.

452
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,580
Hey, you can't pick it up again.

453
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,820
Then I'll take it.

454
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,280
Damn it.

455
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,700
It's time-consuming.

456
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,460
If I have a day off, I'll go to the pachinko shop first.

457
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,200
Damn it.

458
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,020
I'm not going anywhere.

459
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,760
What should I do from now on?

460
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,380
Hey.

461
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
You look like you're going to lose.

462
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,280
What are you doing here?

463
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,720
Are you here to laugh at me?

464
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,360
Come back.

465
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,160
It's going to be cold tonight.

466
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,440
It seems to be.

467
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,340
But I...

468
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
What are you talking about?

469
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,940
That room is our room, right?

470
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,540
Yes.

471
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,560
Damn it.

472
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,340
You idiot.

473
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
I'm never going to come back to this house.

474
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Where are you going?

475
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,500
If you do something like this, you'll catch a cold.

476
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,380
Come back, D.

477
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,280
You're very helpful.

478
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,840
I went out of that room.

479
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,580
I can't go back now.

480
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,460
Come back.

481
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,840
It hurts, right?

482
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,580
You're in pain, but it hurts me too.

483
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,300
I'm a Ryotsu, and you're a Ryotsu.

484
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,720
That room is the room of Ryotsu.

485
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,480
In other words, it's our room.

486
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,240
Don't get carried away to come back to your own room.

487
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,140
Go back, D.

488
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,940
D...

489
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,220
A...

490
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,140
D....A...

491
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,420
Line 3 is now entering the train.

492
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,380
What should we do? We have no money to eat.

493
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,820
Why don't you come back?

494
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,860
You guys!

495
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,380
We're not playing any games!

496
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,380
It's true! We're not playing any games!

497
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,560
I don't have to say anything.

498
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,340
Come back.

499
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,300
You guys...

500
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,580
...have no money.

501
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,800
Only F, huh?

502
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,400
I don't think we can go that far anymore.

503
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,720
Oh, hey, hey...

504
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,220
Oh, oh.

505
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,180
Hey, F!

506
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:33,720
Huh?

507
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,700
WHAAAAAT!?

508
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,060
WHAAAT!?

509
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,700
Wh-what are you doing!?

510
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,220
Where are you going?

511
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,000
You came home, right!?

512
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,340
N-no!

513
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,460
No! I'm talking about that thing you forgot!

514
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,740
I see. You forgot it.

515
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,480
Then shall we eat hot pot?

516
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,620
Hot pot?

517
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,900
Yes. We're celebrating the reunion, so we're all going to eat hot pot.

518
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,480
What about you?

519
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,760
I guess I can't help it. I'll eat it since I'm in a hurry.

520
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,100
Alright, everyone's here.

521
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,720
Itadakimasu!

522
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,460
Eat more!

523
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,860
So good!

524
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,040
Anyone want some?

525
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,680
Yes!

526
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,500
Me too!

527
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,760
What's up, Abe?

528
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,920
It's nice to be with everyone.

529
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,860
How about that?

530
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,080
Alright, let's toast!

531
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:33,840
Cheers!

532
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,200
A

533
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,600
*Groaning*

534
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,860
Man...

535
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,380
*Groaning in pain*

536
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,100
*T FEELING UNREAL CONFUSED*

537
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,840
*Groaning pizza*

538
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,420
*Groaning spicy pizza*

539
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,660
What the heck is this!

540
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,040
What is this?

541
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,320
What is this?

542
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,460
Why is it?

543
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,860
Why is it?

544
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:22,600
Why does Ryo's eyebrows look like black hair?

545
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,420
Why does it?

546
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,080
Why does he run fast with sandals on?

547
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,600
Why does it?

548
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,280
Why does Ryo always do arm wrestling?

549
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,420
Why does he?

550
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,340
Why does he fall in love with everyone?

551
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,580
Why does it?

552
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,660
It doesn't matter

553
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,580
Bon Bon Bon

554
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,760
The title of this anime is so long

555
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,800
This is Katsushikaku, the first appearance in front of Kameari Park

556
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,180
Why is it?

557
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,720
Why is it?

558
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,900
Everyone, let's sing together!

559
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,640
Why is it?

560
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,100
